       "      <td>My father - all of my life - has shifted between a wonderful person and a monster.  At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.</td>\n",

Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that.

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world.

As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself.

At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.     \n",

Is there anyone here who had a \"normal\" childhood who ended up with BPD? I mean, without emotional abuse, neglect, invalidation, etc?\\n\\nSometimes I wonder whether the percent that reports no trauma actually were traumatised in some way but just forgot about it? (Dissociation). On a side note, what would you say are the differences between BPD and complex trauma?   \n",
       "3       Let me preface this by saying that I promise I'll be ok. I'll talk to my therapist, whom I trust and is very very good to me, on Wednesday. \\n\\nBut this needed to come out right now.\\n\\nFor one second, it came into my mind as the solution to everything. \\n\\n- I wouldn't have to feel unloved, misunderstood, and unworthy of love in my relationship\\n- I wouldn't have to feel interchangable in my role as a dad, to feel like my personality has nothing to do with raising a child, like it's just \"shut up and check all the boxes, and If you miss certain boxes it might have irreparable repercussions and we won't tell you which boxes those are.\"\\n- I wouldn't have to feel pressure to take care of my sick parents, coz that's all they want, they refuse any other form of help\\n- I wouldn't have to feel the bottomless guilt of not taking care of my parents at all, despite the above statement.\\n- wouldn't have to worry about being acceptable and performant at my new job, a job I like a lot, but the impostor syndrome is the main feeling from 9-5.\\n- wouldn't have to think that having a kid was a mistake in this day and age, seeing how the world seems to betting worse and worse in every possible aspect. \\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'm not worthy of any contact, coz all my friends message eachother and have social lives online, despite COVID, and yet I'm part of none of that.\\n- wouldn't have to feel guilty and ashamed that I stopped training, used to do it 3-5x a week just by passion and curiosity and it all had to stop coz of a janky knee.\\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'd be bothering the people in my life by telling them \"I'm not okay.\" \\n- wouldn't have to worry about my personal morals, beliefs, religious views, which are impossible to discuss with anyone because it's all dismissed as \"opinion at best, religious fanaticism at worst.\" \\n- wouldn't have to feel angry at myself for no reason. Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.   \n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely. Could I hear from anyone else on here that could maybe give me some sort of advice or insight?   \n",

Other stuff happened where they were hanging out with people who were really mean to all of us. A lot of insecurities came out and my friend didnt really do anything to help them. A month has passed and ive been quiet with them because i dont know whete the friendship is. Shes messaged me a few times annoyed that i dont talj to them and i pmd her to tell her how hard it is to get help. She just kept telling me that they dont know anything ks wrong ic I dont talj to them and \"we're supposed to be family\" so i should tell them when i don't feel good. I just want my friends to care enough to reach out to me. She also complained to me a while because people hadbt checked in on her since ruok day, no one checked on me that day, and few have since   \n",

I cleaned it up and checked many times but I am still so anxious and can't sleep. \\n\\nI decided to go to a psychologist where he/she suggested an exposure therapy.\\n\\nHe poured a box of thumbtacks on the sofa and spread it and we cleaned it up and put it back to the box and he asked me to lay down on the sofa. The psychologist did it first then asked me to do it after him. I lay down on the sofa and 5 minutes passed. He asked me how did I feel. I said I am still anxious. The psychologist told me that the anxiety will decrease over time.\\n\\nI noticed that the therapy didn't work for me so I decided to buy myself a new bed, new blankets and new sheets to calm myself down.Soon, my bed arrived. I was happy and look forward to sleep well.Few days later, I was wearing the same jacket that I used to go to the psychologist.I was sitting on my new bed with that jackets on.

I get jealous because my brain thinks it's romantic bc they're so close when yknow it's entirely possible to have friendships without any hint of romance at all.\\n\\nOn a superficial/theoretical level I do understand that it's possible, but deep down it feels like my brain is just hardwired into thinking the complete opposite.\\n\\nOn the other hand I feel like this might also stem from me not actually having any intimate relationships aside from my SO. When I sense any kind of intimacy or vulnerability from me or a friend, I instinctively back away, because I don't want it to turn into a romantic thing (even when I was single I was already like this, lol).\\n\\nIt sucks bc as much as it hurts to admit, I do just want to have the same level of intimacy my SO has with his best friends as I do with my own best friends. But I'm scared, and I don't know where to start fixing this. I actually tried to be better the past few months with being more vulnerable with friends but they don't seem to reciprocate it, which hurts. I just end up hiding in my shell again like a damn scared turtle.   \n",

I am losing my place to stay in 30 days, and me and my 5 year old will have to end up living in a motel for the foreseeable future. I have always told myself that maybe I’m just a little neurotic, that it skipped me even though both my mom and older sister had BPD. (They both passed last year) I couldn’t be bipolar because I don’t have any addictions. Just making up excuses. (The mood swings and the spending of money irrationally I just swept under the rug) Well instead of paying rent this month I decided to go canoeing and spend my $500 paycheck on a whim thinking “it will be okay, I can make it back by the 5th” like I literally was so manic and delusional that I thought money was just going to come to me 😂 now I am in a complete and utter depression, won’t leave my bed. Thinking how suicide would be better than living this shitty ass life, I would finally be at peace. But there’s that little part of me that is like I need to take responsibility for my actions and finally get help, if not for me at least for my son. \\nI don’t have any type of insurance and obviously cannot afford a therapist. So what are my options, so when I finally hopefully get thru this rough patch in my life, I can get it together.   \n",

       "      <td>My father - all of my life - has shifted between a wonderful person and a monster.  At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.</td>\n",

Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.</td>\n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely.

I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.     \n",

Is there anyone here who had a \"normal\" childhood who ended up with BPD? I mean, without emotional abuse, neglect, invalidation, etc?\\n\\nSometimes I wonder whether the percent that reports no trauma actually were traumatised in some way but just forgot about it? (Dissociation). On a side note, what would you say are the differences between BPD and complex trauma?   \n",
       "3       Let me preface this by saying that I promise I'll be ok.

Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.   \n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely. Could I hear from anyone else on here that could maybe give me some sort of advice or insight?   \n",

Other stuff happened where they were hanging out with people who were really mean to all of us. A lot of insecurities came out and my friend didnt really do anything to help them. A month has passed and ive been quiet with them because i dont know whete the friendship is. Shes messaged me a few times annoyed that i dont talj to them and i pmd her to tell her how hard it is to get help. She just kept telling me that they dont know anything ks wrong ic I dont talj to them and \"we're supposed to be family\" so i should tell them when i don't feel good.

I cleaned it up and checked many times but I am still so anxious and can't sleep. \\n\\nI decided to go to a psychologist where he/she suggested an exposure therapy.\\n\\nHe poured a box of thumbtacks on the sofa and spread it and we cleaned it up and put it back to the box and he asked me to lay down on the sofa. The psychologist did it first then asked me to do it after him. I lay down on the sofa and 5 minutes passed. He asked me how did I feel. I said I am still anxious. The psychologist told me that the anxiety will decrease over time.\\n\\nI noticed that the therapy didn't work for me so I decided to buy myself a new bed, new blankets and new sheets to calm myself down.Soon, my bed arrived. I was happy and look forward to sleep well.Few days later, I was wearing the same jacket that I used to go to the psychologist.I was sitting on my new bed with that jackets on. All of a sudden but my mind keeps telling me that some thumbtacks stuck on my jacket and now it is contaminating the new sheets and new bed again? HELP ME PLEASE!!!! I am now super depressed and anxious!   \n",

I get jealous because my brain thinks it's romantic bc they're so close when yknow it's entirely possible to have friendships without any hint of romance at all.\\n\\nOn a superficial/theoretical level I do understand that it's possible, but deep down it feels like my brain is just hardwired into thinking the complete opposite.\\n\\nOn the other hand I feel like this might also stem from me not actually having any intimate relationships aside from my SO. When I sense any kind of intimacy or vulnerability from me or a friend, I instinctively back away, because I don't want it to turn into a romantic thing (even when I was single I was already like this, lol).\\n\\nIt sucks bc as much as it hurts to admit, I do just want to have the same level of intimacy my SO has with his best friends as I do with my own best friends. But I'm scared, and I don't know where to start fixing this. I actually tried to be better the past few months with being more vulnerable with friends but they don't seem to reciprocate it, which hurts. I just end up hiding in my shell again like a damn scared turtle.   \n",

I am losing my place to stay in 30 days, and me and my 5 year old will have to end up living in a motel for the foreseeable future. I have always told myself that maybe I’m just a little neurotic, that it skipped me even though both my mom and older sister had BPD. (They both passed last year) I couldn’t be bipolar because I don’t have any addictions. Just making up excuses. (The mood swings and the spending of money irrationally I just swept under the rug) Well instead of paying rent this month I decided to go canoeing and spend my $500 paycheck on a whim thinking “it will be okay, I can make it back by the 5th” like I literally was so manic and delusional that I thought money was just going to come to me 😂 now I am in a complete and utter depression, won’t leave my bed. Thinking how suicide would be better than living this shitty ass life, I would finally be at peace. But there’s that little part of me that is like I need to take responsibility for my actions and finally get help, if not for me at least for my son. \\nI don’t have any type of insurance and obviously cannot afford a therapist. So what are my options, so when I finally hopefully get thru this rough patch in my life, I can get it together.   \n",

What are the fantasies like? \\n\\nIll start: I had an FP who i was in love with (or thought i was in love with) but he only loved me as a friend. I would fantasize about us \"going to the next level\"... but it would be more about comfort and security... like \"i'll take care of you forever, you'll never have to worry about anything ever again...\" etc.\\nIt got to the point where fantasizing about him was mildly interfering with my relationship with him in real life. I'd rather fantasize about him than actual talk to him, because talking to him was far more stressful. And when i saw him in real life, i was always a bit disappointed because he could never meet the standards of how he treated me in the fantasy. \\n\\nI've had fantasies like this since i was a child... They feature different imaginary people (based off movie characters or whoever I had a crush on at the time, or even my actual boyfriend while we were long distanec)... it's always a boyfriend (or, when i was a child, an older brother) who would protect me and keep me safe.. and it's definitely intertwined with sex/romantic feelings. Clearly I think i feel insecure and have abandonment issues? \\n\\nOk everyone, spill.</td>\n",

I wanna end it all tonight. I'm fucking tired of the constant pain, everytime I look in the mirror, I just wanna die, I hate myself, I'm an ugly, fat, unlovable piece of shit, I'm 16 but I look fuckin 30. I wanna cut so bad. I just wish I had someone to share the pain with, someone to love, but I don't deserve that. Goodbye everyone. \\n\\n\\nBefore I go, here is my story. \\nMy name is Ethan, my parents got divorced when I was 9, that's when my depression started. My dad cheated on my mom, I blamed the divorce on him, hated him for it. Really I blamed him for how my mom treated me, I thought he made her into that monster. Truth was she was always like that. I'm not gonna say, she was an awful parent, she didn't beat me. Most the time she was loving, but she had \"moments\". She always told us \" love is a lie\" \"there is no prince Charming\" \"all men are pigs\" \"men are awful\" growing up as a male, in that household, was difficult, made my depression worse. When I was 13 I started cutting, around the same time my first relationship ended, shortly after, I went into another one, Jasmine. Bipolar as shit, would tell me she loved me one moment, tell me she wanted me to kill myself the next, I cut alot during our relationship. One day, she told me to kill myself, I did. Overdosed on my medication and ended up in the hospital, had a 5 day mental health inpatient after the ER. My mom drove me to the hospital, it was a 40 minutes drive, felt like years. She said \"you wanna die so badly ill kill you myself\" treated to jam her fingers down my throat, punched me in the chest, hard, multiple times on the way. Before this, when I asked her if I needed to go to the hospital, if I could, trying to set up a safety plan, she threw my shoes at me and told me to get in the car, she tried to \"exorcise\" my depression once, burning stuff around my bed. After the hospital visit I was in 3 weeks worth of programs, it got better. Mom did not. I got into another relationship after that, lasted about 2 years. Complete opposite of my last one. She was Mormon, made things... Difficult, wasn't aloud to date until 16. We didn't use that label, but we did basically date. She was very busy, I had frequent episodes, made things difficult, eventually it ended badly, I blame myself. Had others after her, was cheated on, and other stuff. Was going down in a never ending spiral. Sometime after I turned 15 I met Molly, I fell in love, she didn't feel the same, but, we were best friends, loved eachother in a different way, my mental issues eventually drove that away too. Nothing made me feel better, except self harm, until I found, substances. First nicotine, then alcohol, then my drug of choice, weed, then coke, then overdosing on over the counter stuff, like benadryl, and cough syrup. Whatever I could to not be sober, I was never sober, never wanted to feel my emotions, when I did, I cut. Molly was with me through it all. Until one day, I came home from school drunk, had the biggest sh lapse of my life, and went to my second mental hospital, I was there for 13 days, turn ned 16 there, tried to commit suicide while I was in there. After words I went to rehab. It was a dual diagnosis, mental health and substance abuse residential. I was there for 2 months. It helped, I was diagnosed with BPD in there, met many great friends, miss them all. Went into a 3 month iop program, started working at the same time, fuckin hated my boss, absolute asshole. Anyways. Molly got me through it all, I had a 15 minute phone call a week I spend on her. Eventually, she ghosted me when I was having an episode, I kept on reaching out, I drove her away even more, I hate myself. Currently, I'm a week clean from sh, and a month sober, I've worked on myself so much have gotten so much better but it doesn't matter, I'm gonna end it, I'm done, I'm still alone, crying myself to sleep, none of it matters.</td>\n",

When I was younger and first learning about the Holocaust in school, my mom showed me the following letter, which had been written by my cousin and detailed his experience in Germany.\\n\\nFirst hand accounts and knowledge of such events can be easily lost and rarely accounted for in history textbooks, so my hope is that this post can help to expand other's knowledge and understanding of what happened in and around the concentration camps setup and operated by the third Reich.\\n\\nMauthausen was liberated on May 5/6, 1945 by elements of the 11th Armored Division. One standout fact about the liberation of this camp is that the Spanish photographer Francesc Boix was imprisoned there, and managed to smuggle out thousands of negative photographs, which were later used during the Nuremberg trials as evidence.\\n\\nI myself am a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, but I each time I read this letter, I truly cannot comprehend what must have been going through his mind just trying to process the horror of the camps.\\n\\nHopefully this letter adds some perspective for those who read it, as it did for me.\\n\\nI know this is quite a serious and somber topic, but I would like to highlight a bit of brevity from the letter itself; my cousin was a field grade officer, in a Jeep full of Colonels, and to no one's surprise, they got lost and ended up encountering the furthest advanced Russian forces before they found their way again.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/NMT7emR</td>\n",

What do you fantasize about? : Who is your FP? Are you attracted to your FP in a romantic way? Do you fantasize about them? What are the fantasies like? \\n\\nIll start: I had an FP who i was in love with (or thought i was in love with) but he only loved me as a friend. I would fantasize about us \"going to the next level\"... but it would be more about comfort and security... like \"i'll take care of you forever, you'll never have to worry about anything ever again...\" etc.\\nIt got to the point where fantasizing about him was mildly interfering with my relationship with him in real life. I'd rather fantasize about him than actual talk to him, because talking to him was far more stressful. And when i saw him in real life, i was always a bit disappointed because he could never meet the standards of how he treated me in the fantasy. \\n\\nI've had fantasies like this since i was a child... They feature different imaginary people (based off movie characters or whoever I had a crush on at the time, or even my actual boyfriend while we were long distanec)... it's always a boyfriend (or, when i was a child, an older brother) who would protect me and keep me safe.. and it's definitely intertwined with sex/romantic feelings. Clearly I think i feel insecure and have abandonment issues? \\n\\nOk everyone, spill.   \n",

Those have nothing to do with OCD and do nothing but trivialize a debilitating illness that the people here deal with.\\n\\nYou'd think that the sidebar and all the posts here would clue these people in that this is a mental health support sub but apparently people can't take ten seconds to look around the subreddit before making shitposts.\\n\\nI greatly appreciate if you guys can please report any posts like that you see, because anyone posting stuff like that here is getting banned.  Period.  \\n\\nI honestly can't believe this even needs to be said, but here we are.   \n",

But im scared.  Either im really about to be controlled by the demons (don't know what they are,  but it's the best description I can muster), or im losing this battle with my bipolar.  Im scared whichever way this goes.  I don't want to be like this.   \n",

I graduated college, which means I'm officaily an \"adult\" - which is has been scaring me a lot. I am now hours away from my girlfriend, I don't have a daily routine because I'm done with classes, I'm back in the quiet suburbs at home (away from all my friends and places I liked to spend time), my parents are constantly yelling at one another, dogs always barking, and I continue having nightmares of my anxiety related fears. Everything started to get really bad on my graduation day though.\\n\\nI recently had a panic attack while at my college graduation ceremony. I was in the middle of this crowded, huge, very hot, loud, gymnasium and felt lightheaded. I ended up panicking and spent an hour extremely upset, laying down in an ambulance next to the gym for an hour. \\n\\nSince then I've been feeling \"sick\" for a few days and unsure if this is my anxiety. MY ANXIETY ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I AM EXPERIENCING A HORRIBLE ILLNESS. I'm never sure if it is my anxiety or not. I've been distressed even days after the panic attack at school. \\n\\nI feel exhausted, \"out of it,\" heartburn, have gotten a palpitation, sore/dry throat, dry tasting mouth, watery eyes, stressed, verge of crying, very depressed, hopeless, extremely scared all the time, tense jaw, very scared, racing thoughts of dying, mucus in back of nose, and it just feels uncomfortable to live. These symptoms just reinforce my fears of getting sick - so it's this vicious cycle.   \n",

At the end of her life, she lost most of her mental faculties. She was lethargic, seemingly depressed, didn't want to do anything but lay down, and was in general, a shadow of who she had once been. That's how I feel, like my brain is now defective.   \n",

       "42108  16M suicidal, lonely, need to feel loved before the end. Tonight Is it. I need to talk. : don't really know why I'm making this post, I don't want anyone to save me anymore. I wanna end it all tonight. I'm fucking tired of the constant pain, everytime I look in the mirror, I just wanna die, I hate myself, I'm an ugly, fat, unlovable piece of shit, I'm 16 but I look fuckin 30. I wanna cut so bad. I just wish I had someone to share the pain with, someone to love, but I don't deserve that. Goodbye everyone. \\n\\n\\nBefore I go, here is my story. \\nMy name is Ethan, my parents got divorced when I was 9, that's when my depression started. My dad cheated on my mom, I blamed the divorce on him, hated him for it. Really I blamed him for how my mom treated me, I thought he made her into that monster. Truth was she was always like that. I'm not gonna say, she was an awful parent, she didn't beat me. Most the time she was loving, but she had \"moments\". She always told us \" love is a lie\" \"there is no prince Charming\" \"all men are pigs\" \"men are awful\" growing up as a male, in that household, was difficult, made my depression worse. When I was 13 I started cutting, around the same time my first relationship ended, shortly after, I went into another one, Jasmine. Bipolar as shit, would tell me she loved me one moment, tell me she wanted me to kill myself the next, I cut alot during our relationship. One day, she told me to kill myself, I did. Overdosed on my medication and ended up in the hospital, had a 5 day mental health inpatient after the ER. My mom drove me to the hospital, it was a 40 minutes drive, felt like years. She said \"you wanna die so badly ill kill you myself\" treated to jam her fingers down my throat, punched me in the chest, hard, multiple times on the way. Before this, when I asked her if I needed to go to the hospital, if I could, trying to set up a safety plan, she threw my shoes at me and told me to get in the car, she tried to \"exorcise\" my depression once, burning stuff around my bed. After the hospital visit I was in 3 weeks worth of programs, it got better. Mom did not. I got into another relationship after that, lasted about 2 years. Complete opposite of my last one. She was Mormon, made things... Difficult, wasn't aloud to date until 16. We didn't use that label, but we did basically date. She was very busy, I had frequent episodes, made things difficult, eventually it ended badly, I blame myself. Had others after her, was cheated on, and other stuff. Was going down in a never ending spiral. Sometime after I turned 15 I met Molly, I fell in love, she didn't feel the same, but, we were best friends, loved eachother in a different way, my mental issues eventually drove that away too. Nothing made me feel better, except self harm, until I found, substances. First nicotine, then alcohol, then my drug of choice, weed, then coke, then overdosing on over the counter stuff, like benadryl, and cough syrup. Whatever I could to not be sober, I was never sober, never wanted to feel my emotions, when I did, I cut. Molly was with me through it all. Until one day, I came home from school drunk, had the biggest sh lapse of my life, and went to my second mental hospital, I was there for 13 days, turn ned 16 there, tried to commit suicide while I was in there. After words I went to rehab. It was a dual diagnosis, mental health and substance abuse residential. I was there for 2 months. It helped, I was diagnosed with BPD in there, met many great friends, miss them all. Went into a 3 month iop program, started working at the same time, fuckin hated my boss, absolute asshole. Anyways. Molly got me through it all, I had a 15 minute phone call a week I spend on her. Eventually, she ghosted me when I was having an episode, I kept on reaching out, I drove her away even more, I hate myself. Currently, I'm a week clean from sh, and a month sober, I've worked on myself so much have gotten so much better but it doesn't matter, I'm gonna end it, I'm done, I'm still alone, crying myself to sleep, none of it matters.   \n",

Pretty excited but at the same time,  I seem to mistake the excitement for anxiety and I just feel very uncomfortable all the time. It feels like I'm bursting at the seams and I can't relax nor sleep. My mind has just gone completely overdrive and I can't turn it off.

When I was younger and first learning about the Holocaust in school, my mom showed me the following letter, which had been written by my cousin and detailed his experience in Germany.\\n\\nFirst hand accounts and knowledge of such events can be easily lost and rarely accounted for in history textbooks, so my hope is that this post can help to expand other's knowledge and understanding of what happened in and around the concentration camps setup and operated by the third Reich.\\n\\nMauthausen was liberated on May 5/6, 1945 by elements of the 11th Armored Division. One standout fact about the liberation of this camp is that the Spanish photographer Francesc Boix was imprisoned there, and managed to smuggle out thousands of negative photographs, which were later used during the Nuremberg trials as evidence.\\n\\nI myself am a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, but I each time I read this letter, I truly cannot comprehend what must have been going through his mind just trying to process the horror of the camps.\\n\\nHopefully this letter adds some perspective for those who read it, as it did for me.\\n\\nI know this is quite a serious and somber topic, but I would like to highlight a bit of brevity from the letter itself; my cousin was a field grade officer, in a Jeep full of Colonels, and to no one's surprise, they got lost and ended up encountering the furthest advanced Russian forces before they found their way again.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/NMT7emR   \n",

I maintained sleep and food schedule through it. Things happened that angered me but I expressed it where it was intended relatively calmly and it didn't ruin my day, I could move on to other things. I was super socially anxious when I got to the exam room but again I kept reminding myself that no one really cared and that it would be okay. And it was. I was very focused on my exam and I did well.   \n",

What are the fantasies like? \\n\\nIll start: I had an FP who i was in love with (or thought i was in love with) but he only loved me as a friend. I would fantasize about us \"going to the next level\"... but it would be more about comfort and security... like \"i'll take care of you forever, you'll never have to worry about anything ever again...\" etc.\\nIt got to the point where fantasizing about him was mildly interfering with my relationship with him in real life. I'd rather fantasize about him than actual talk to him, because talking to him was far more stressful. And when i saw him in real life, i was always a bit disappointed because he could never meet the standards of how he treated me in the fantasy. \\n\\nI've had fantasies like this since i was a child... They feature different imaginary people (based off movie characters or whoever I had a crush on at the time, or even my actual boyfriend while we were long distanec)... it's always a boyfriend (or, when i was a child, an older brother) who would protect me and keep me safe.. and it's definitely intertwined with sex/romantic feelings.

I wanna end it all tonight. I'm fucking tired of the constant pain, everytime I look in the mirror, I just wanna die, I hate myself, I'm an ugly, fat, unlovable piece of shit, I'm 16 but I look fuckin 30. I wanna cut so bad. I just wish I had someone to share the pain with, someone to love, but I don't deserve that. Goodbye everyone. \\n\\n\\nBefore I go, here is my story. \\nMy name is Ethan, my parents got divorced when I was 9, that's when my depression started. My dad cheated on my mom, I blamed the divorce on him, hated him for it. Really I blamed him for how my mom treated me, I thought he made her into that monster. Truth was she was always like that. I'm not gonna say, she was an awful parent, she didn't beat me. Most the time she was loving, but she had \"moments\". She always told us \" love is a lie\" \"there is no prince Charming\" \"all men are pigs\" \"men are awful\" growing up as a male, in that household, was difficult, made my depression worse. When I was 13 I started cutting, around the same time my first relationship ended, shortly after, I went into another one, Jasmine. Bipolar as shit, would tell me she loved me one moment, tell me she wanted me to kill myself the next, I cut alot during our relationship. One day, she told me to kill myself, I did. Overdosed on my medication and ended up in the hospital, had a 5 day mental health inpatient after the ER. My mom drove me to the hospital, it was a 40 minutes drive, felt like years. She said \"you wanna die so badly ill kill you myself\" treated to jam her fingers down my throat, punched me in the chest, hard, multiple times on the way. Before this, when I asked her if I needed to go to the hospital, if I could, trying to set up a safety plan, she threw my shoes at me and told me to get in the car, she tried to \"exorcise\" my depression once, burning stuff around my bed. After the hospital visit I was in 3 weeks worth of programs, it got better. Mom did not. I got into another relationship after that, lasted about 2 years. Complete opposite of my last one. She was Mormon, made things... Difficult, wasn't aloud to date until 16. We didn't use that label, but we did basically date. She was very busy, I had frequent episodes, made things difficult, eventually it ended badly, I blame myself. Had others after her, was cheated on, and other stuff. Was going down in a never ending spiral. Sometime after I turned 15 I met Molly, I fell in love, she didn't feel the same, but, we were best friends, loved eachother in a different way, my mental issues eventually drove that away too. Nothing made me feel better, except self harm, until I found, substances. First nicotine, then alcohol, then my drug of choice, weed, then coke, then overdosing on over the counter stuff, like benadryl, and cough syrup. Whatever I could to not be sober, I was never sober, never wanted to feel my emotions, when I did, I cut. Molly was with me through it all. Until one day, I came home from school drunk, had the biggest sh lapse of my life, and went to my second mental hospital, I was there for 13 days, turn ned 16 there, tried to commit suicide while I was in there. After words I went to rehab. It was a dual diagnosis, mental health and substance abuse residential. I was there for 2 months. It helped, I was diagnosed with BPD in there, met many great friends, miss them all. Went into a 3 month iop program, started working at the same time, fuckin hated my boss, absolute asshole. Anyways. Molly got me through it all, I had a 15 minute phone call a week I spend on her. Eventually, she ghosted me when I was having an episode, I kept on reaching out, I drove her away even more, I hate myself. Currently, I'm a week clean from sh, and a month sober, I've worked on myself so much have gotten so much better but it doesn't matter, I'm gonna end it, I'm done, I'm still alone, crying myself to sleep, none of it matters.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Family letter detailing the conditions and liberation of Mauthausen concentration camp in Bavaria, Germany, May 1945 : This post is in relation to a post discussing the Holocaust on another subreddit, talking about the teaching of the events which took place during the Second World War. When I was younger and first learning about the Holocaust in school, my mom showed me the following letter, which had been written by my cousin and detailed his experience in Germany.\\n\\nFirst hand accounts and knowledge of such events can be easily lost and rarely accounted for in history textbooks, so my hope is that this post can help to expand other's knowledge and understanding of what happened in and around the concentration camps setup and operated by the third Reich.\\n\\nMauthausen was liberated on May 5/6, 1945 by elements of the 11th Armored Division. One standout fact about the liberation of this camp is that the Spanish photographer Francesc Boix was imprisoned there, and managed to smuggle out thousands of negative photographs, which were later used during the Nuremberg trials as evidence.\\n\\nI myself am a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, but I each time I read this letter, I truly cannot comprehend what must have been going through his mind just trying to process the horror of the camps.\\n\\nHopefully this letter adds some perspective for those who read it, as it did for me.\\n\\nI know this is quite a serious and somber topic, but I would like to highlight a bit of brevity from the letter itself; my cousin was a field grade officer, in a Jeep full of Colonels, and to no one's surprise, they got lost and ended up encountering the furthest advanced Russian forces before they found their way again.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/NMT7emR</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm very proud of myself today : I had an exam today and my anxiety started kicking in last night but I spoke to myself calmly through it, encouraged myself and I studied. I maintained sleep and food schedule through it. Things happened that angered me but I expressed it where it was intended relatively calmly and it didn't ruin my day, I could move on to other things. I was super socially anxious when I got to the exam room but again I kept reminding myself that no one really cared and that it would be okay. And it was.

What do you fantasize about? : Who is your FP? Are you attracted to your FP in a romantic way? Do you fantasize about them? What are the fantasies like? \\n\\nIll start: I had an FP who i was in love with (or thought i was in love with) but he only loved me as a friend. I would fantasize about us \"going to the next level\"... but it would be more about comfort and security... like \"i'll take care of you forever, you'll never have to worry about anything ever again...\" etc.\\nIt got to the point where fantasizing about him was mildly interfering with my relationship with him in real life. I'd rather fantasize about him than actual talk to him, because talking to him was far more stressful. And when i saw him in real life, i was always a bit disappointed because he could never meet the standards of how he treated me in the fantasy. \\n\\nI've had fantasies like this since i was a child... They feature different imaginary people (based off movie characters or whoever I had a crush on at the time, or even my actual boyfriend while we were long distanec)... it's always a boyfriend (or, when i was a child, an older brother) who would protect me and keep me safe.. and it's definitely intertwined with sex/romantic feelings. Clearly I think i feel insecure and have abandonment issues? \\n\\nOk everyone, spill.   \n",

Those have nothing to do with OCD and do nothing but trivialize a debilitating illness that the people here deal with.\\n\\nYou'd think that the sidebar and all the posts here would clue these people in that this is a mental health support sub but apparently people can't take ten seconds to look around the subreddit before making shitposts.\\n\\nI greatly appreciate if you guys can please report any posts like that you see, because anyone posting stuff like that here is getting banned.  Period.  \\n\\nI honestly can't believe this even needs to be said, but here we are.   \n",

But im scared.  Either im really about to be controlled by the demons (don't know what they are,  but it's the best description I can muster), or im losing this battle with my bipolar.  Im scared whichever way this goes.  I don't want to be like this.   \n",

I graduated college, which means I'm officaily an \"adult\" - which is has been scaring me a lot. I am now hours away from my girlfriend, I don't have a daily routine because I'm done with classes, I'm back in the quiet suburbs at home (away from all my friends and places I liked to spend time), my parents are constantly yelling at one another, dogs always barking, and I continue having nightmares of my anxiety related fears. Everything started to get really bad on my graduation day though.\\n\\nI recently had a panic attack while at my college graduation ceremony. I was in the middle of this crowded, huge, very hot, loud, gymnasium and felt lightheaded. I ended up panicking and spent an hour extremely upset, laying down in an ambulance next to the gym for an hour. \\n\\nSince then I've been feeling \"sick\" for a few days and unsure if this is my anxiety. MY ANXIETY ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I AM EXPERIENCING A HORRIBLE ILLNESS. I'm never sure if it is my anxiety or not. I've been distressed even days after the panic attack at school. \\n\\nI feel exhausted, \"out of it,\" heartburn, have gotten a palpitation, sore/dry throat, dry tasting mouth, watery eyes, stressed, verge of crying, very depressed, hopeless, extremely scared all the time, tense jaw, very scared, racing thoughts of dying, mucus in back of nose, and it just feels uncomfortable to live. These symptoms just reinforce my fears of getting sick - so it's this vicious cycle.   \n",

At the end of her life, she lost most of her mental faculties. She was lethargic, seemingly depressed, didn't want to do anything but lay down, and was in general, a shadow of who she had once been. That's how I feel, like my brain is now defective.   \n",

       "42108  16M suicidal, lonely, need to feel loved before the end. Tonight Is it. I need to talk. : don't really know why I'm making this post, I don't want anyone to save me anymore. I wanna end it all tonight. I'm fucking tired of the constant pain, everytime I look in the mirror, I just wanna die, I hate myself, I'm an ugly, fat, unlovable piece of shit, I'm 16 but I look fuckin 30. I wanna cut so bad. I just wish I had someone to share the pain with, someone to love, but I don't deserve that. Goodbye everyone. \\n\\n\\nBefore I go, here is my story. \\nMy name is Ethan, my parents got divorced when I was 9, that's when my depression started. My dad cheated on my mom, I blamed the divorce on him, hated him for it. Really I blamed him for how my mom treated me, I thought he made her into that monster. Truth was she was always like that. I'm not gonna say, she was an awful parent, she didn't beat me. Most the time she was loving, but she had \"moments\". She always told us \" love is a lie\" \"there is no prince Charming\" \"all men are pigs\" \"men are awful\" growing up as a male, in that household, was difficult, made my depression worse. When I was 13 I started cutting, around the same time my first relationship ended, shortly after, I went into another one, Jasmine. Bipolar as shit, would tell me she loved me one moment, tell me she wanted me to kill myself the next, I cut alot during our relationship. One day, she told me to kill myself, I did. Overdosed on my medication and ended up in the hospital, had a 5 day mental health inpatient after the ER. My mom drove me to the hospital, it was a 40 minutes drive, felt like years. She said \"you wanna die so badly ill kill you myself\" treated to jam her fingers down my throat, punched me in the chest, hard, multiple times on the way. Before this, when I asked her if I needed to go to the hospital, if I could, trying to set up a safety plan, she threw my shoes at me and told me to get in the car, she tried to \"exorcise\" my depression once, burning stuff around my bed. After the hospital visit I was in 3 weeks worth of programs, it got better. Mom did not. I got into another relationship after that, lasted about 2 years. Complete opposite of my last one. She was Mormon, made things... Difficult, wasn't aloud to date until 16. We didn't use that label, but we did basically date. She was very busy, I had frequent episodes, made things difficult, eventually it ended badly, I blame myself. Had others after her, was cheated on, and other stuff. Was going down in a never ending spiral. Sometime after I turned 15 I met Molly, I fell in love, she didn't feel the same, but, we were best friends, loved eachother in a different way, my mental issues eventually drove that away too. Nothing made me feel better, except self harm, until I found, substances. First nicotine, then alcohol, then my drug of choice, weed, then coke, then overdosing on over the counter stuff, like benadryl, and cough syrup. Whatever I could to not be sober, I was never sober, never wanted to feel my emotions, when I did, I cut. Molly was with me through it all. Until one day, I came home from school drunk, had the biggest sh lapse of my life, and went to my second mental hospital, I was there for 13 days, turn ned 16 there, tried to commit suicide while I was in there. After words I went to rehab. It was a dual diagnosis, mental health and substance abuse residential. I was there for 2 months. It helped, I was diagnosed with BPD in there, met many great friends, miss them all. Went into a 3 month iop program, started working at the same time, fuckin hated my boss, absolute asshole. Anyways. Molly got me through it all, I had a 15 minute phone call a week I spend on her. Eventually, she ghosted me when I was having an episode, I kept on reaching out, I drove her away even more, I hate myself. Currently, I'm a week clean from sh, and a month sober, I've worked on myself so much have gotten so much better but it doesn't matter, I'm gonna end it, I'm done, I'm still alone, crying myself to sleep, none of it matters.   \n",

Pretty excited but at the same time,  I seem to mistake the excitement for anxiety and I just feel very uncomfortable all the time. It feels like I'm bursting at the seams and I can't relax nor sleep. My mind has just gone completely overdrive and I can't turn it off.

When I was younger and first learning about the Holocaust in school, my mom showed me the following letter, which had been written by my cousin and detailed his experience in Germany.\\n\\nFirst hand accounts and knowledge of such events can be easily lost and rarely accounted for in history textbooks, so my hope is that this post can help to expand other's knowledge and understanding of what happened in and around the concentration camps setup and operated by the third Reich.\\n\\nMauthausen was liberated on May 5/6, 1945 by elements of the 11th Armored Division. One standout fact about the liberation of this camp is that the Spanish photographer Francesc Boix was imprisoned there, and managed to smuggle out thousands of negative photographs, which were later used during the Nuremberg trials as evidence.\\n\\nI myself am a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, but I each time I read this letter, I truly cannot comprehend what must have been going through his mind just trying to process the horror of the camps.\\n\\nHopefully this letter adds some perspective for those who read it, as it did for me.\\n\\nI know this is quite a serious and somber topic, but I would like to highlight a bit of brevity from the letter itself; my cousin was a field grade officer, in a Jeep full of Colonels, and to no one's surprise, they got lost and ended up encountering the furthest advanced Russian forces before they found their way again.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/NMT7emR   \n",

I maintained sleep and food schedule through it. Things happened that angered me but I expressed it where it was intended relatively calmly and it didn't ruin my day, I could move on to other things. I was super socially anxious when I got to the exam room but again I kept reminding myself that no one really cared and that it would be okay. And it was. I was very focused on my exam and I did well.   \n",

       "      <td>Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.</td>\n",

There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.</td>\n",

There he feels safe he feels only himself can see something of a regular in this life. Why cant i just have thoughts like others why do they halt me in my step and claw at my skin, why do they make me rethink everything i see. Who do i trust when my thoughts are the only thing i know will be there, they will never leave they will never fail me. There is a certain comfort in that, i am never truly lonely that voice will always be there talking shit judging me judging those around me.\\nAt the end of the day when he sleeps and the warzone that is my mind has called a ceasefire, i know he is never leaving and i love him for that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I lost my best friend 5 months ago to suicide and now I feel like I’m losing myself I genuinely cannot hold it together anymore, I’m teetering on the brink of insanity, I haven’t done anything this past week due to the complete lack of motivation. Sitting in my room and talking to myself just makes me even more suicidal, I’m tired of calling myself useless garbage that doesn’t deserve to be loved and that I deserve to be treated the way that I am. Most of my friends and family ignore my cries of help and therapy doesn’t help at all, those who do help have given up as they can’t possibly fathom that I’ll stay alive for much longer. I miss the one who truly cared about me, he hanged himself after I went home from his house, he gave me an ominous hint and I didn’t call the police fast enough to save him, I feel as if I failed him, his family and his/my friends. Nobody truly knows how much he meant to me and I haven’t been able to get any real sleep as I get vivid pictures of his corpse. It’s been five months and everybody expects me to get over it but the pain still hurts just as much. \\n\\nHappiness is only temporary for me, and in lows like this it feels like the only solution is a rope around my neck. Is it morbid if I want to see who will cry like I did losing him??\\n\\nThanks for reading my horrible thoughts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I want to share my diagnosis with someone recently diagnosed to help them cope, but don't want to risk my family finding out I have bipolar. I just found out that a friend close to my family was diagnosed recently with bipolar. I have been diagnosed for 2 years now. I would dearly love to reach out and offer some support by being able to share everything I've been through and learned, and also make them feel less alone. Like they have a safe resource and someone who understands, not just empathizes. They said they have nobody they can talk to.\\n\\nBut the thing is.. I haven't shared my diagnosis with my family, and have no intentions of doing so. I know everybody has different theories on this but that is the best decision for me given my family dynamic. \\n\\nA big thing for me when I first was diagnosed was this fear that I couldn't trust what I might say when I was manic or depressed and I might share secrets unintentionally and I felt super untrustworthy. I had a very hard time trusting myself. \\nSo being faced with the prospect of sharing a deeply personal secret with someone who might not be able to keep that secret, I just don't know what to do. I'm really worried they might out me to my family someday when they're unstable or when their mood tells them it's a good idea when it's not. They have a history of very irrational and erratic behavior that makes me nervous.\\n\\nThis person has always been very misunderstood and isolated and I so so want to be able to tell this person that they didn't just fall further down into that hole of isolation and in fact are closer to someone than they ever knew. But I don't want to jeopardize my own boundaries.\\n\\nShould I risk it?\\n\\n(And yes I know there are plenty of ways to offer support, help, and resources without sharing my personal mental conditions. I'm mostly asking about that last step of sharing my secret, but please feel free to suggest alternatives)</td>\n",

First I want say how great it is to be able to talk about things open in a way I never have before.\\n\\nI am at a good point in terms of drug and alcohol right now, but I've had big problems in the past.\\n\\n I od'd many times, each time it was not an intentional suicide attempt, it was me totally not caring about what happened to me and being in extreme distress, usually because of my abusive mother. All this occurred over the space of decades.\\n\\nOnce I fucked up bad with alcohol and methadone. I ended up in the ICU. The doctor told me that a large number of bipolar people have addiction problems.\\n\\nNow I take my meds exactly as prescribed and the only other drug I use is marijuana, which is not a problem. \\n\\nAre there others of you that have had any similar problems?   \n",
       "2      Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.    \n",

I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.   \n",

My best friends girlfriend left him over something stupid and embarrassing that he did a while back.Anyways I'm pretty sure it's that, he's always saying how he wants to go to an island all alone with no one who loves him. He's told me before that he has depression but never said that he's suicidal. I asked him about it and he firmly denied it. He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.   \n",

Heart pacing hand starts to shake \\n\"Here we go again\"\\nRushing to the bathroom go find somewhere safe,somewhere where no eyes shall judge or watch. There he feels safe he feels only himself can see something of a regular in this life. Why cant i just have thoughts like others why do they halt me in my step and claw at my skin, why do they make me rethink everything i see. Who do i trust when my thoughts are the only thing i know will be there, they will never leave they will never fail me. There is a certain comfort in that, i am never truly lonely that voice will always be there talking shit judging me judging those around me.\\nAt the end of the day when he sleeps and the warzone that is my mind has called a ceasefire, i know he is never leaving and i love him for that.   \n",

Sitting in my room and talking to myself just makes me even more suicidal, I’m tired of calling myself useless garbage that doesn’t deserve to be loved and that I deserve to be treated the way that I am. Most of my friends and family ignore my cries of help and therapy doesn’t help at all, those who do help have given up as they can’t possibly fathom that I’ll stay alive for much longer. I miss the one who truly cared about me, he hanged himself after I went home from his house, he gave me an ominous hint and I didn’t call the police fast enough to save him, I feel as if I failed him, his family and his/my friends. Nobody truly knows how much he meant to me and I haven’t been able to get any real sleep as I get vivid pictures of his corpse. It’s been five months and everybody expects me to get over it but the pain still hurts just as much. \\n\\nHappiness is only temporary for me, and in lows like this it feels like the only solution is a rope around my neck. Is it morbid if I want to see who will cry like I did losing him??\\n\\nThanks for reading my horrible thoughts.   \n",

I just found out that a friend close to my family was diagnosed recently with bipolar. I have been diagnosed for 2 years now. I would dearly love to reach out and offer some support by being able to share everything I've been through and learned, and also make them feel less alone. Like they have a safe resource and someone who understands, not just empathizes. They said they have nobody they can talk to.\\n\\nBut the thing is.. I haven't shared my diagnosis with my family, and have no intentions of doing so. I know everybody has different theories on this but that is the best decision for me given my family dynamic. \\n\\nA big thing for me when I first was diagnosed was this fear that I couldn't trust what I might say when I was manic or depressed and I might share secrets unintentionally and I felt super untrustworthy. I had a very hard time trusting myself. \\nSo being faced with the prospect of sharing a deeply personal secret with someone who might not be able to keep that secret, I just don't know what to do. I'm really worried they might out me to my family someday when they're unstable or when their mood tells them it's a good idea when it's not. They have a history of very irrational and erratic behavior that makes me nervous.\\n\\nThis person has always been very misunderstood and isolated and I so so want to be able to tell this person that they didn't just fall further down into that hole of isolation and in fact are closer to someone than they ever knew. But I don't want to jeopardize my own boundaries.\\n\\nShould I risk it?\\n\\n(And yes I know there are plenty of ways to offer support, help, and resources without sharing my personal mental conditions. I'm mostly asking about that last step of sharing my secret, but please feel free to suggest alternatives)   \n",

I know this probably sounds crazy, but sometimes I fantasize talking to someone about my depression because I’ve never opened up to anyone about it before and I wish I could.   \n",

       "      <td>Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.</td>\n",

There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.</td>\n",

I haven't shared my diagnosis with my family, and have no intentions of doing so. I know everybody has different theories on this but that is the best decision for me given my family dynamic. \\n\\nA big thing for me when I first was diagnosed was this fear that I couldn't trust what I might say when I was manic or depressed and I might share secrets unintentionally and I felt super untrustworthy. I had a very hard time trusting myself. \\nSo being faced with the prospect of sharing a deeply personal secret with someone who might not be able to keep that secret, I just don't know what to do. I'm really worried they might out me to my family someday when they're unstable or when their mood tells them it's a good idea when it's not. They have a history of very irrational and erratic behavior that makes me nervous.\\n\\nThis person has always been very misunderstood and isolated and I so so want to be able to tell this person that they didn't just fall further down into that hole of isolation and in fact are closer to someone than they ever knew.

First I want say how great it is to be able to talk about things open in a way I never have before.\\n\\nI am at a good point in terms of drug and alcohol right now, but I've had big problems in the past.\\n\\n I od'd many times, each time it was not an intentional suicide attempt, it was me totally not caring about what happened to me and being in extreme distress, usually because of my abusive mother. All this occurred over the space of decades.\\n\\nOnce I fucked up bad with alcohol and methadone. I ended up in the ICU. The doctor told me that a large number of bipolar people have addiction problems.\\n\\nNow I take my meds exactly as prescribed and the only other drug I use is marijuana, which is not a problem. \\n\\nAre there others of you that have had any similar problems?   \n",
       "2      Wanted to share some revelations I just had tonight about depression...for the first time in over a year I have hope that things can get better. Hi, I've been depressed for over a year. I still am depressed, but for the first time throughout this hell I actually have gained some insight and now I have hope that things can get better. For me this is really a breath of fresh air because my depression has literally been suffocating me for so long. I know this won't necessarily apply to everyone but I really hope what I share can maybe give some people insight and hope as well. At first I thought my depression was a result of my loneliness. I was able to function okay at work and around people, but when I got home alone it felt like the walls were caving on on me. My mind would race with suicidal and self loathing thoughts. \"I hate you\", \"Kill yourself\", \"Why are you so stupid\"...just examples of things I would say in my head to myself.  It is very overwhelming to be in this state of mind and for a long time I thought the only way I would ever be able to find peace of mind is through suicide. I was hospitalized a few months ago for suicidal ideation by my co worker, who had me admitted when I told her I was constantly thinking about killing myself. My hospitalization was tramtic, I felt trapped. Nobody tried to help me. I was isolated in a room for 3 days...it felt like prison. To this day I still think that my hospitalization only made my depression worse. It was really the first time anyone showed that they would do anything they could to help me though, and to this day I will never forget that my co worker really cared about me and was worried sick about what I told her. I was prescribed Wellbutrin while hospitalized. I didn't get any therapy in the hospital, nobody tried to help me conquer my depression. I got the feeling my psychiatrist was just prescribing me a pill, expecting it to \"fix\" me. Although they told me how important therapy was in combination with medication, I didn't really understand that until now. So I learned tonight, after being on wellbutrin for over 5 months that antidepressants don't actually do anything for depression itself(at least for me). They only suppress the symptoms of depression. For me wellbutrin didnt make me happy, or able to feel emotion. It just gave me energy. It allowed me to wake up and not feel completely drained of energy and unable to move. For the duration I've been on wellbutrin I could still feel my depression mounting and it continued to get worse. The physical symptoms of depression were completely debilitating tonight for me. At work there was no real reason for me to be depressed, there wasn't anything affecting my emotions...I just felt it. I couldn't focus, I couldn't smile(I do door to door work, having a genuine smile is very important, people can definitely tell when you're faking), I couldn't connect with people, I couldn't think...my mind wasnt racing it really just felt...kind of blah...like I couldnt get in a peaceful state of mind even though there wasnt anything bringing me down. I ended up leaving work because I just couldn't get my mind straight. I had to walk about 3 miles to get back to my car so I started talking to my sister(who is very experienced with mental problems, her spouse is BPD, severely depressed, suicidal etc). My mom had actually called her concerned because for the last few days I have been telling my mom that Im suicidal, I just want the pain to end. After thinking carefully about things I came to the conclusion that I don't actually want to die or commit suicide. It's just that the feeling produced by my depression is so severe, that I couldn't think of any other way to express the severity of the way I feel other than to say \"I want to die, I want to kill myself\". So I told my sister...instead of saying \"I want to die\" I would start saying \"I want this feeling to stop\". This was really the first awakening moment for me tonight. I realized that I really do want to live...I just don't want to feel like this anymore and for a long time I thought the only way that I could achieve peace of mind was through suicide. Then I started thinking about why welbutrin wasnt doing anything for the feeling that my depression produces...it wasnt doing anything for the certain feeling in the pit of my stomach...its like an overwhelming feeling of emptiness.but it was helping the symptoms. At this point I learned that the symptoms of depression, and depression itself are not the same thing. I now see my depression as a disease, that will probably never go away. The medication can help suppress the symptoms of my disease and make it easier to live with, and therapy can help me control and cope with the disease itself. Now I have a plan of action for how I can survive this horrible condition even though I know it will never go away. I don't feel happy but I find some comfort in knowing that there are things I can do to feel better, even though I know i will probably never feel normal(or like I did before I became depressed). Thanks for reading I hope some of the thing's I've learned might help some other people. Especially the part about me not wanting die, but just being unable to express the severity of how depression makes me feel. What I really crave the most is peace of mind... and I think I've discovered a plan to gain some peace.    \n",

I find that I don't have real \"wants\" anymore. There would be a flicker of a desire that maybe I want to play Overwatch and it will be fun, but it fizzles as fast as it comes. I think for a moment that maybe I should feed myself. Then I just don't do it. Most days I end up curled up in bed, waiting for the hours to go by There are so many \"shoulds\" but nothink I *want* to so. An essay due monday? That's just another flicker of thought triggered by sheer sense of responsibility, not by my own conscious will. Besides, who cares about tests and essays when you're thinking about suicide. One week blurs into the next with only another bland weekend in which nothing happens in between. I feel deader than dead. I lived with it for a long while and was diagnosed when it developed suicidal after so many years. Child depression really goes unnoticed, especially because you yourself is not old and knowledgeable enough to recognize it as depression in the first place. The meds work and I'm lucky enough to have money to buy them, but I don't know if they really help. The logical side of me says this is just another bottom-of-the-ocean-deep low phase in my unending cycle of ups and downs. The real me says whatever, I just want to be gone and free from the pain that is life. The only reason I held on so far is my parents. They did nothing to deserve a dead child. I wouldn't be able to repay their love and for the longest time I am just a medicine-run burden. I wish I could love them back. I do love them but I just don't feel anything. It's hard to feel pain, to laugh, to even cry anymore. I'm drained and numb. As dead as dead without physically being dead. I'm a machine that runs on medicine. A ghost that breathes. About time I'm done holding out.\\n\\nOnce upon a time I had a dream. An unrealistic one that even I didn't beleive in. I wanted to be a doctor. A loving doctor who would smile and wave as discharged patients left the hospital. I wanted to help people. To work with groups like doctors without borders and go heal those in need of help. I went to college and realized how the brutal path was simply not for someone of my level. I'm neither smart enough, motivated enough, not dead enough, or probably going to be alive long enough. It's all a sci-fi fantasy now, since dreams became obsolete since I started feeling numb years ago. Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm really alive. I feel done.   \n",

My best friends girlfriend left him over something stupid and embarrassing that he did a while back.Anyways I'm pretty sure it's that, he's always saying how he wants to go to an island all alone with no one who loves him. He's told me before that he has depression but never said that he's suicidal. I asked him about it and he firmly denied it. He's always saying really self hating stuff all the time like \"I'm just a little emo prick\" or \"I'm such a depressed little bitch\" Idk what to do.Help.   \n",

Heart pacing hand starts to shake \\n\"Here we go again\"\\nRushing to the bathroom go find somewhere safe,somewhere where no eyes shall judge or watch. There he feels safe he feels only himself can see something of a regular in this life. Why cant i just have thoughts like others why do they halt me in my step and claw at my skin, why do they make me rethink everything i see. Who do i trust when my thoughts are the only thing i know will be there, they will never leave they will never fail me. There is a certain comfort in that, i am never truly lonely that voice will always be there talking shit judging me judging those around me.\\nAt the end of the day when he sleeps and the warzone that is my mind has called a ceasefire, i know he is never leaving and i love him for that.   \n",

Sitting in my room and talking to myself just makes me even more suicidal, I’m tired of calling myself useless garbage that doesn’t deserve to be loved and that I deserve to be treated the way that I am. Most of my friends and family ignore my cries of help and therapy doesn’t help at all, those who do help have given up as they can’t possibly fathom that I’ll stay alive for much longer. I miss the one who truly cared about me, he hanged himself after I went home from his house, he gave me an ominous hint and I didn’t call the police fast enough to save him, I feel as if I failed him, his family and his/my friends. Nobody truly knows how much he meant to me and I haven’t been able to get any real sleep as I get vivid pictures of his corpse. It’s been five months and everybody expects me to get over it but the pain still hurts just as much. \\n\\nHappiness is only temporary for me, and in lows like this it feels like the only solution is a rope around my neck. Is it morbid if I want to see who will cry like I did losing him??\\n\\nThanks for reading my horrible thoughts.   \n",

I just found out that a friend close to my family was diagnosed recently with bipolar. I have been diagnosed for 2 years now. I would dearly love to reach out and offer some support by being able to share everything I've been through and learned, and also make them feel less alone. Like they have a safe resource and someone who understands, not just empathizes. They said they have nobody they can talk to.\\n\\nBut the thing is.. I haven't shared my diagnosis with my family, and have no intentions of doing so. I know everybody has different theories on this but that is the best decision for me given my family dynamic. \\n\\nA big thing for me when I first was diagnosed was this fear that I couldn't trust what I might say when I was manic or depressed and I might share secrets unintentionally and I felt super untrustworthy. I had a very hard time trusting myself. \\nSo being faced with the prospect of sharing a deeply personal secret with someone who might not be able to keep that secret, I just don't know what to do. I'm really worried they might out me to my family someday when they're unstable or when their mood tells them it's a good idea when it's not. They have a history of very irrational and erratic behavior that makes me nervous.\\n\\nThis person has always been very misunderstood and isolated and I so so want to be able to tell this person that they didn't just fall further down into that hole of isolation and in fact are closer to someone than they ever knew. But I don't want to jeopardize my own boundaries.\\n\\nShould I risk it?\\n\\n(And yes I know there are plenty of ways to offer support, help, and resources without sharing my personal mental conditions. I'm mostly asking about that last step of sharing my secret, but please feel free to suggest alternatives)   \n",

I know this probably sounds crazy, but sometimes I fantasize talking to someone about my depression because I’ve never opened up to anyone about it before and I wish I could.   \n",

And that will never change.\\n\\nI have nothing left worth living for, nothing that I actually care about, and I'm worth nothing to anyone. It's as simple as that. Life just wasn't for me.   \n",

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore.

People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&amp;gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

       "53038  Nobody takes me seriously I’ve (24M) dealt with depression/anxiety for years now. I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road   \n",

My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

Hi, all. I have to give a presentation at work next week (45 minutes long and the CEO will be in attendance). I’m already panicking, as once the anxiety kicks in, I’m certain I’m going to forget everything I’m supposed to say. ( anxiety makes it very difficult for me to focus on anything) Does anyone have any speaking tips that have worked for them in the past? Thanks so much!   \n",

It's not about being scared I didn't lock the door or something, I'm just really scared of opening doors the wrong way or turning a key the wrong way in front of people or pushing instead of pulling and viceversa, it's honestly debilitating because i feel like I'm gonna die everytime I have to open a door.

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road</td>\n",

My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&amp;gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

       "53038  Nobody takes me seriously I’ve (24M) dealt with depression/anxiety for years now. I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road   \n",

My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

I’m already panicking, as once the anxiety kicks in, I’m certain I’m going to forget everything I’m supposed to say. ( anxiety makes it very difficult for me to focus on anything) Does anyone have any speaking tips that have worked for them in the past? Thanks so much!   \n",

       "      <td>My father - all of my life - has shifted between a wonderful person and a monster.  At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.</td>\n",

Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.</td>\n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely.

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away.

At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.     \n",

Is there anyone here who had a \"normal\" childhood who ended up with BPD? I mean, without emotional abuse, neglect, invalidation, etc?\\n\\nSometimes I wonder whether the percent that reports no trauma actually were traumatised in some way but just forgot about it? (Dissociation). On a side note, what would you say are the differences between BPD and complex trauma?   \n",
       "3      Let me preface this by saying that I promise I'll be ok. I'll talk to my therapist, whom I trust and is very very good to me, on Wednesday. \\n\\nBut this needed to come out right now.\\n\\nFor one second, it came into my mind as the solution to everything. \\n\\n- I wouldn't have to feel unloved, misunderstood, and unworthy of love in my relationship\\n- I wouldn't have to feel interchangable in my role as a dad, to feel like my personality has nothing to do with raising a child, like it's just \"shut up and check all the boxes, and If you miss certain boxes it might have irreparable repercussions and we won't tell you which boxes those are.\"\\n- I wouldn't have to feel pressure to take care of my sick parents, coz that's all they want, they refuse any other form of help\\n- I wouldn't have to feel the bottomless guilt of not taking care of my parents at all, despite the above statement.\\n- wouldn't have to worry about being acceptable and performant at my new job, a job I like a lot, but the impostor syndrome is the main feeling from 9-5.\\n- wouldn't have to think that having a kid was a mistake in this day and age, seeing how the world seems to betting worse and worse in every possible aspect. \\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'm not worthy of any contact, coz all my friends message eachother and have social lives online, despite COVID, and yet I'm part of none of that.\\n- wouldn't have to feel guilty and ashamed that I stopped training, used to do it 3-5x a week just by passion and curiosity and it all had to stop coz of a janky knee.\\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'd be bothering the people in my life by telling them \"I'm not okay.\" \\n- wouldn't have to worry about my personal morals, beliefs, religious views, which are impossible to discuss with anyone because it's all dismissed as \"opinion at best, religious fanaticism at worst.\" \\n- wouldn't have to feel angry at myself for no reason. Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.   \n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely. Could I hear from anyone else on here that could maybe give me some sort of advice or insight?   \n",

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road   \n",

My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

Hi, all. I have to give a presentation at work next week (45 minutes long and the CEO will be in attendance).

       "      <td>My father - all of my life - has shifted between a wonderful person and a monster.  At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.</td>\n",

Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.</td>\n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely.

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore.

At his best, he is supportive, calm, positive, funny, caring.  At his worst, he is vicious, selfish, hateful, paranoid, mean, abusive, and hurtful.  He has become an alcoholic slowly in the past decade.  I believe he has BPD - but has blatantly and combatively  refused to get help everytime it has been brought up in the past.\\n\\nFast forward - I carried a lot of baggage on my shoulder which led to quite a bit of self medication.  I've been relatively successful in my career choice, although it is an arduous journey in my chosen profession.  A year ago, I decided to move in with my grandparents to prepare for doctoral school, find a job to get some finances in order, and get the monkey off of my back.  \\n\\nThat summer, he was offended I wasn't going to him for help (which of course, he can not provide, and would do far more to destruct me than help me).  He wanted me to work with him (he does independent landscaping) and when I refused to work with him, he lashed out.  In a drunken stupor, he called me and left over 15 voice mails that were viscous and disgusting.  He is excellent at finding people's weaknesses and pouncing on them. Again, something he has done all of my life.  After a few days, I called him and told him if he ever talked to me that way again, it would be the last time he talked to me.\\n\\nWell, fast forward a year and half.  I've moved away to another state to start doctoral school and am free from the burdens I have had in the past.  I am doing very well at school, although I still sometimes deal with residual of the past.  My dad started doing it again.  He called on a Sunday night.  On Monday at 8am, I teach a class at my university.  So I go to bed relatively early, but at 11:30 he started texting and calling me.  I told him I had to get up early, knowing he was drunk (after listening to a voice mail), that he needed to stop.  This escalated everything.  I don't know what got in to me, but I decided to escalate him as far as I could go.  I threw, for once, everything he gave me right back at him.  I told him, that night, there would be consequences - I reminded him of my ultimatum, but he would not stop.  I blocked his number, and his voice mails still went to my inbox, eventually filling it up.\\n\\nSo HERE's MY question...finally...I have told him (after a week of getting terrible text messages and phone calls) that I will not contact him until he has seen a doctor, started therapy, and sought out medication.  \\n\\nCan someone, or many of you, please help me here?  This is something he NEEDS - or I fear he will either commit suicide or drink himself to death.  Both have been fears of the past.  How do I help him, but at the same time retain and reinforce my boundaries that he has torn down my entire life in efforts to control me.  \\n\\nPlease.  Halp.     \n",

Is there anyone here who had a \"normal\" childhood who ended up with BPD? I mean, without emotional abuse, neglect, invalidation, etc?\\n\\nSometimes I wonder whether the percent that reports no trauma actually were traumatised in some way but just forgot about it? (Dissociation). On a side note, what would you say are the differences between BPD and complex trauma?   \n",
       "3      Let me preface this by saying that I promise I'll be ok. I'll talk to my therapist, whom I trust and is very very good to me, on Wednesday. \\n\\nBut this needed to come out right now.\\n\\nFor one second, it came into my mind as the solution to everything. \\n\\n- I wouldn't have to feel unloved, misunderstood, and unworthy of love in my relationship\\n- I wouldn't have to feel interchangable in my role as a dad, to feel like my personality has nothing to do with raising a child, like it's just \"shut up and check all the boxes, and If you miss certain boxes it might have irreparable repercussions and we won't tell you which boxes those are.\"\\n- I wouldn't have to feel pressure to take care of my sick parents, coz that's all they want, they refuse any other form of help\\n- I wouldn't have to feel the bottomless guilt of not taking care of my parents at all, despite the above statement.\\n- wouldn't have to worry about being acceptable and performant at my new job, a job I like a lot, but the impostor syndrome is the main feeling from 9-5.\\n- wouldn't have to think that having a kid was a mistake in this day and age, seeing how the world seems to betting worse and worse in every possible aspect. \\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'm not worthy of any contact, coz all my friends message eachother and have social lives online, despite COVID, and yet I'm part of none of that.\\n- wouldn't have to feel guilty and ashamed that I stopped training, used to do it 3-5x a week just by passion and curiosity and it all had to stop coz of a janky knee.\\n- wouldn't have to feel like I'd be bothering the people in my life by telling them \"I'm not okay.\" \\n- wouldn't have to worry about my personal morals, beliefs, religious views, which are impossible to discuss with anyone because it's all dismissed as \"opinion at best, religious fanaticism at worst.\" \\n- wouldn't have to feel angry at myself for no reason. Just straight up no reason, yet always always angry. I hate myself so gratuitously, it's sickening.\\n- wouldn't have to feel sorry for opening up in the slightest to my SO, because no matter how much tact, care, and attention I put into a discussion, it always blows up in my face. I have yet to experience \"you and me versus the problem.\"\\n- wouldn't have to feel responsible for my immediate family's uncontrollable patterns, because if I'm in control of myself and my patterns and they arent in control of theirs, obviously it's up to me to help them, right? \\n- wouldn't have to feel selfish and egotistical at making this post, in a place where it can trigger actually suicidal people, despite the fact that I purposefully avoid this subreddit, knowing that it might trigger me suicidally without me ever having felt it before.\\n- wouldn't have to feel... think... Do... Be... \\n\\nIf my life has been the constant contraction of a muscle, death would be the much needed relaxing of that muscle.\\n\\nThanks for reading, I'm sorry you had to see that. I do promise to you and myself that I'll be okay. But this was the first time in my life that suicide came into my mind as the answer.   \n",

She exhibits all the classic symptoms and has a history of intense unstable relationships, either adores me to death or hates me and has an incredibly hard time understanding any sort of pain that is caused to her: either as a response to her meanness or in terms of friends dropping out of her life completely without warning. When I hear her talk about what has happened to her, it is clear to me that she is the issue but she seems to be totally ignorant to it. Even during our own disputes, all of her traits (manipulative, have to walk on egg shells around her, mean and then nice, unempathetic) she blames me for instead of seeing herself at fault.\\n\\nNow I've tried to talk to her a lot but if I direct any sort of accusation towards her or try to explain that maybe she has to take some responsibility for herself, she goes into a rage and suddenly I'm the worst person in the world. Clearly she needs help, but it's looking like there's no way that I can tell her that. As much as I'd love to help her understand, and as much as this all makes me so sad it's seeming like it's impossible and the more I try, the more pain I only seem to cause myself. Now I am thinking that the only solution for me is to do what some of her friends have done and to block her out completely. Could I hear from anyone else on here that could maybe give me some sort of advice or insight?   \n",

I used to be great with people, make good money, have the nice cars, great girlfriend, supportive parents, friends that I could say looked up to me etc. and then I was diagnosed with depression. Within about a year, I quit my job, lost my girlfriend even though she was great to me, and have yet to keep a stable job for more than a month at a time. \\n\\nMy depression eventually was ruled to be “treatment resistant” after being on a number of meds and trying many other things. Some would work for a couple months and then I’d fall even further back from where I was. \\n\\nBut now, after not having worked since early July of 2022, I am dealing with extensive and scary brain fog. I’ve incorporated working out, eating healthier, taking supplements and just trying to live a healthier lifestyle as I figured this was coming from a bad diet my whole life. I also got all blood work done including thyroid, basics, vitamin levels, testosterone etc and everything came back normal other than pretty high cholesterol. Both doctors I’ve seen (general practitioner, psychiatrist) has kinda blown me off when I tell them about the brain fog. Almost like they don’t really know what to say or what the next step should be to ruling out causes. \\n\\nI’m so scared as I’m feeling like I’m going crazy or have dementia. My parents are usually very supportive when I’m going through stuff but my mom doesn’t even want to hear me talk about it and my dad isn’t always around as he lives about 45 mins away. I ended up packing some things and driving to his house tonight without saying anything to my mom. I just hate feeling alone and don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m at the end of my road   \n",

My friends are happy, and I'm always the one who's not really funny and who ruins the mood. So now I try to say as little as possible, people always ask me if I'm okay, if I'm tired, or worse, they say I'm scary. I think I'm just a mistake. People must find me weird or creepy, it's ruining me. A few years ago, my brother committed suicide, I felt very close to him, I think about his death all the time, I wish I could start my life over again and make the right choices (for once). What affects me the most is girls, I think... It's ridiculous, but I would love to have a relationship with a (very) pretty girl. Sometimes I think I've suffered so much that I would at least deserve that. I saw the damage my brother's death caused in my family, now I think if I didn't have a family to make suffer =&gt; suicide. My message is so selfish, and I know it.

Hi, all. I have to give a presentation at work next week (45 minutes long and the CEO will be in attendance). I’m already panicking, as once the anxiety kicks in, I’m certain I’m going to forget everything I’m supposed to say. ( anxiety makes it very difficult for me to focus on anything) Does anyone have any speaking tips that have worked for them in the past? Thanks so much!   \n",

It's not about being scared I didn't lock the door or something, I'm just really scared of opening doors the wrong way or turning a key the wrong way in front of people or pushing instead of pulling and viceversa, it's honestly debilitating because i feel like I'm gonna die everytime I have to open a door. I wondered if anyone else has the same problem and how to fix it if possible.   \n",

       "      <td>As Shakespeare astutely observed (in Romeo and Juliet):\\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\\nSince I’ve been around, ADHD has been called several different things. In the 1950s the official name was minimal brain dysfunction. Later on it was hyperkinetic reaction of childhood, then attention-deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, and in 1987 becoming ADHD.\\nWhatever name we’d choose to call ADHD, the nature of the condition remains the same.\\nAs you imply, in ADHD it’s not that people can’t attend to things, the issue is that they have real trouble doing so consistently and reliably. Yeah, attention diverges from the intended target, that is, the individual is distracted, attention goes to extraneous or irrelevant matters.\\nBut “attention” isn’t a simple thing. Attending to a task is complex and involves the coordination of numerous circuits in the brain. One key element is the reward or motivational component. When ADHD people report being “bored” with a task they mean doing the task is unrewarding. In turn lack of reward kills motivation to get it done.\\nAn old idea is that people with ADHD suffer from a “reward deficiency syndrome”. They tend not to credit themselves for successes big or small. Motivation is often more hypothetical than actual. For example, an ADHD adult has an idea to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Getting through a tough math course is hard without a strong enough gut-level drive to stick with it.\\nOTOH ADHD folks are often activated by negative outcomes. Thing is a factor has to be quite negative to have an effect. This may show up as procrastinating. Students with ADHD notoriously put off doing assignments until the deadline looms. That’s when the consequences of not doing it become real. “I can’t afford to flunk this class, I better get going on it” and it’s a mad scramble to the finish.\\nThere are many elements that contribute to “attention deficits” in ADHD. We can see it’s about trouble prioritizing, “structuring” one’s time and effort, self-motivation, experience of reward or giving oneself credit where due. Deficient coordination among brain regions underlies core ADHD phenomena like inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.\\nWe could invent alternative names but I don’t think any name could adequately capture the amazing complexity and variability intrinsic to the condition.\\nBottom line is that “ADHD” is about as good a name as any that we’d put in its place.</td>\n",

Even as I live on my own I'm just constantly under the weight of feeling like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do. \\n\\nSo I thought maybe posting a quick pic of my place as is and maybe others sharing too? I know it's a bit odd but sometimes it feels like you're the only one in the world incapable of keeping your place together. And sometimes it feels like a disaster when it's not too bad. Or maybe it is. \\n\\n[Currently a mess](https://i.imgur.com/c6qz54T.jpg)\\n\\nThat's an Ethernet cable running from my router to my computer because I haven't had the energy to run another one that actually doesn't look like crap. The vacuum cleaner is out as a reminder to vacuum. The chewy box will be making it's way to my recycling today. But overall this is a snapshot of what I'm constantly battling in my life. Things get put down and then they don't get picked up. And I couldn't tell you why they just disappear out of sight.\\n\\nEdit: Wow this blew up. But I also responded to a lot of people in here lol. You all are a fantastic community. I'm really glad people felt better from this post. Those of us with ADHD truly don't always get the support we need and sometimes giving it to ourselves is tough. The small things can really wear away at you and you don't even realize it. Hoping everyone here gives themselves the space to improve their own living situation for the benefit of themselves vs feeling pressured into it out of shame.</td>\n",

It gave me so much of what I needed to build the strength to let my current doctor go. I have a telehealth visit with her on Tuesday and planned on telling her that I will be finding a new doctor. For some reason, I'm extraordinarily nervous, but know I need to do this AND tell her why.\\n\\n Incidentally, I took my 4yr old to the pediatrician today for her flu shot and found out by accident that our beloved doctor is family practice and I can see him too! I even specifically asked him if he's comfortable treating with patients with ADHD and he said yes! He even talked with me about how misdiagnosed people with ADHD are with depression and he said \"I've had so many patients come in thinking they're depressed when in reality they have ADHD and they're just depressed because they can't get s*** done.\" Like he ACTUALLY gets it.  And he has known  me for YEARS as person not just as a patient. And my oldest is medically complicated so he knows us WELL. I'm so excited to have someone I really know and really really trust as MY doctor. I have a feeling I'm never going to be accused of drug seeking again!!  I want to cry! \\n\\nThank you everyone. I needed the groups validation to push through and make this change. My life is going to be so much better. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was diagnosed with ADHD back in the late 1980s, when people thought that ADHD was just about attentiveness. When I was diagnosed, diagnoses of ADHD were literally \"kids with this particular constellation of symptoms can be helped to pay attention in school with stimulants.\"\\n\\nLiterally nobody told me - EVER - that my difficulty with managing emotions was part of it, until I found a YouTube video of someone explaining about the intersection of ADHD and emotional management (specifically anger management).\\n\\nI cried. For HOURS. I have felt SO BAD over the years about my emotional management abilities (or lack thereof) for so long. I think for the first time I *understand* why when my emotional management fails it tends to fail catastrophically, why it's so hard to stop spiraling once I start and why I can cause pain for myself and others because I *can't fucking make myself stop.*\\n\\nI'm not *bad*. Just part of my brain is broken.</td>\n",

It is all I can think about and is interfering with my schoolwork and anything else I try to accomplish, because I can’t focus on anything else. \\n\\nThis is a frequent and frustrating experience.

       "0     As Shakespeare astutely observed (in Romeo and Juliet):\\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\\nSince I’ve been around, ADHD has been called several different things. In the 1950s the official name was minimal brain dysfunction. Later on it was hyperkinetic reaction of childhood, then attention-deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, and in 1987 becoming ADHD.\\nWhatever name we’d choose to call ADHD, the nature of the condition remains the same.\\nAs you imply, in ADHD it’s not that people can’t attend to things, the issue is that they have real trouble doing so consistently and reliably. Yeah, attention diverges from the intended target, that is, the individual is distracted, attention goes to extraneous or irrelevant matters.\\nBut “attention” isn’t a simple thing. Attending to a task is complex and involves the coordination of numerous circuits in the brain. One key element is the reward or motivational component. When ADHD people report being “bored” with a task they mean doing the task is unrewarding. In turn lack of reward kills motivation to get it done.\\nAn old idea is that people with ADHD suffer from a “reward deficiency syndrome”. They tend not to credit themselves for successes big or small. Motivation is often more hypothetical than actual. For example, an ADHD adult has an idea to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Getting through a tough math course is hard without a strong enough gut-level drive to stick with it.\\nOTOH ADHD folks are often activated by negative outcomes. Thing is a factor has to be quite negative to have an effect. This may show up as procrastinating. Students with ADHD notoriously put off doing assignments until the deadline looms. That’s when the consequences of not doing it become real. “I can’t afford to flunk this class, I better get going on it” and it’s a mad scramble to the finish.\\nThere are many elements that contribute to “attention deficits” in ADHD. We can see it’s about trouble prioritizing, “structuring” one’s time and effort, self-motivation, experience of reward or giving oneself credit where due. Deficient coordination among brain regions underlies core ADHD phenomena like inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity.\\nWe could invent alternative names but I don’t think any name could adequately capture the amazing complexity and variability intrinsic to the condition.\\nBottom line is that “ADHD” is about as good a name as any that we’d put in its place.   \n",

Dr Barkley has a series of alternative suggestions based on what ADHD actually does as well. All variations around the theme of Attention Regulation Disorder. You’ll find them somewhere in his 3 hour Essential Ideas for Parents video on YouTube. And it’s an excess of attention, not a deficit. His other suggestions revolve around Executive Function Disorder, as an impaired Executive Function is also one of the key factors. As is Emotional Dysregulation and that’s not even in the DSM at the moment, despite a large number of professionals lobbying for it to be put back.   \n",

Always got criticism from parents growing up. Even as I live on my own I'm just constantly under the weight of feeling like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do. \\n\\nSo I thought maybe posting a quick pic of my place as is and maybe others sharing too? I know it's a bit odd but sometimes it feels like you're the only one in the world incapable of keeping your place together. And sometimes it feels like a disaster when it's not too bad. Or maybe it is. \\n\\n[Currently a mess](https://i.imgur.com/c6qz54T.jpg)\\n\\nThat's an Ethernet cable running from my router to my computer because I haven't had the energy to run another one that actually doesn't look like crap. The vacuum cleaner is out as a reminder to vacuum. The chewy box will be making it's way to my recycling today. But overall this is a snapshot of what I'm constantly battling in my life. Things get put down and then they don't get picked up. And I couldn't tell you why they just disappear out of sight.\\n\\nEdit: Wow this blew up. But I also responded to a lot of people in here lol. You all are a fantastic community. I'm really glad people felt better from this post. Those of us with ADHD truly don't always get the support we need and sometimes giving it to ourselves is tough. The small things can really wear away at you and you don't even realize it. Hoping everyone here gives themselves the space to improve their own living situation for the benefit of themselves vs feeling pressured into it out of shame.   \n",

It gave me so much of what I needed to build the strength to let my current doctor go. I have a telehealth visit with her on Tuesday and planned on telling her that I will be finding a new doctor. For some reason, I'm extraordinarily nervous, but know I need to do this AND tell her why.\\n\\n Incidentally, I took my 4yr old to the pediatrician today for her flu shot and found out by accident that our beloved doctor is family practice and I can see him too! I even specifically asked him if he's comfortable treating with patients with ADHD and he said yes! He even talked with me about how misdiagnosed people with ADHD are with depression and he said \"I've had so many patients come in thinking they're depressed when in reality they have ADHD and they're just depressed because they can't get s*** done.\" Like he ACTUALLY gets it.  And he has known  me for YEARS as person not just as a patient. And my oldest is medically complicated so he knows us WELL. I'm so excited to have someone I really know and really really trust as MY doctor. I have a feeling I'm never going to be accused of drug seeking again!!  I want to cry! \\n\\nThank you everyone. I needed the groups validation to push through and make this change. My life is going to be so much better. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   \n",

I'm a college student and its 4:34am and I'm up because I'm SUPPOSED to be doing homework for my class tomorrow but I streamed and watched videos for the past 6 hours. I always stay up late because I feel like I COULD do something at the late hours of the night but I never do and I just end up going to sleep feeling like shit. I was wondering if other people relate to this weird feeling to purposely avoiding sleep for no real reason. 〒▽〒   \n",

When I was diagnosed, diagnoses of ADHD were literally \"kids with this particular constellation of symptoms can be helped to pay attention in school with stimulants.\"\\n\\nLiterally nobody told me - EVER - that my difficulty with managing emotions was part of it, until I found a YouTube video of someone explaining about the intersection of ADHD and emotional management (specifically anger management).\\n\\nI cried. For HOURS. I have felt SO BAD over the years about my emotional management abilities (or lack thereof) for so long. I think for the first time I *understand* why when my emotional management fails it tends to fail catastrophically, why it's so hard to stop spiraling once I start and why I can cause pain for myself and others because I *can't fucking make myself stop.*\\n\\nI'm not *bad*.

I acknowledged that mistake, apologized to said friend, and he immediately forgave me. That should have been the end of it.\\n\\nBut now I have spent all day obsessing over this incident. It is all I can think about and is interfering with my schoolwork and anything else I try to accomplish, because I can’t focus on anything else. \\n\\nThis is a frequent and frustrating experience. I have talked to my neurotypical friends and they generally find that once a situation is resolved they can let it go. Meanwhile, I cannot take my mind away from it at all no matter how hard I try.\\n\\nAny suggestions to help with this?   \n",

You develop suicidal thoughts and self harming thoughts on a regular basis because you hate the body that your in. You can become hysterical when looking in the mirror because in your eyes you look unlike other people around you as if you were alien. It angers you when people compliment you because you cant trust their opinion and you think they're lying. You feel paranoid in public because your looks are on your mind 24/7 and you think that others are judging you based on them. You're always locked away in the dark and you avoid leaving the house because you feel depressed and you get nervous around others. You are unable to make eye contact with other people. sometimes you think that you're the ugliest person in the world. You become physco and crazy because you're mind is fucked up and you're in constant war with your thoughts.\\nYeah...lovely stuff :)</td>\n",

I cannot accept compliments, even from family, I always feel like I have somehow tricked everyone into thinking I’m a nice person, or I feel like people pity me so much to the point that they’d lie about my appearance as to not have to deal with me. I feel sickened at myself, and when I feel like I can’t find anything flattering to wear, I spiral and become anxious and sometimes depressed. I hate it. I feel like no matter what haircare/style/skincare I do I will always look and feel like shit. I want to be content with my body but I see so many girls that look good in their body types and clothes then I take a look at myself and I want to vomit because I feel like I should look like them or like if I had the money to dress like them I’d be pretty. Even if I did I’d still find something about myself to be disgusted or disappointed with. These are some of the rare picture I feel pretty in. Two of them have no filter. The filters make me feel like a fairy which I love, but it is pretty rare to get a photo of me that I don’t feel super uncomfortable in. I don’t want people taking pictures of me, not even my boyfriend, and if someone does take a picture of me I try and sit far enough back the the pixels blur out my face.

I cannot escape the reality that I am a deformed, decrepit creature that oozes ugliness. As a result I compare myself to everyone I see, and can spend hours at a time just picking at my skin and measuring my fucked up disgusting nose and chin and the rest of my putrid face with my fingers. This is where the compulsions come into play into BDD. Contrary to belief, bdd is not related to eating disorders at all (although, yes, comorbidities can occur) the DSM-5 classifies BDD in the chapter of “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,” along with OCD and several other disorders. The obsessions and compulsions featured alongside BDD are to help deal with the somatic symptoms.\\nMost things trigger me:\\nany word to describe physical aesthetics\\nSeeing a woman with all the features I desire (even a man actually.)\\nMirrors\\nReflections\\nCompliments\\nPictures taken of myself\\nCameras aimed near or around me\\nSeeing someone with the traits I hate about myself\\nSymmetry in people's faces\\nAsymmetry in people's faces\\nThis disorder is horrible. It has ruined my enjoyment in so many situations over something seemingly small. From the moment I wake up to moment I go to bed, I cannot escape my thoughts.\\n“if I was prettier then I wouldn't have to feel like this\"\\n“my nose is huge, why does it have to have a bump in the middle?”\\n“why can’t I be beautiful?”\\n“why can’t I just look normal?”\\n“why do I look like this?”\\n“I'm a disgusting putrid looking monster\"\\nThese words always feel like slime in my brain, but they won't stop.\\nAnd when people become annoyed or tell you what you're seeing isn't true-\\n“they're lying\"\\n“they just don't want to admit I'm horrendous looking\"\\n“they're just being nice\"\\nI can never believe people when they say anything nice about my appearance. My brain is wired with reflexes to deny. In these moments, I seek comfort from the bdd community on various sites that use a hashtag. As I scroll I am bewildered. These people post pictures of their bodies? Some have selfies? I read their captions and sigh.\\n“I've been working so long to get the body I want\"\\n“Years ago I would've never taken a picture of my body without posing”\\nI see a lot of people using BDD as an interchangeable term with eating disorders. Time after time, I’ve seen people have posted these kinds of pictures and I see a #edrecovery following the #bdd. One of the specific requirements for receiving a diagnosis of bdd, is the Differentiation from an eating disorder: If the appearance preoccupations focus on being too fat or weighing too much, the clinician must determine that these concerns are not better explained by an eating disorder. If the patient’s only appearance concern focuses on excessive fat or weight, and the patient’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, then he or she should be diagnosed with an eating disorder, not BDD (taken from Diagnosing BDD - BDD)\\nSo when I go to these communities looking for solidarity and support- I am at times greeted with people who are ignorant about what bdd is and it saddens me because it reminds me, how far away of a time it is until people understand this disorder properly.\\nOverall?\\nI feel like shit every single day with this horrible disorder.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trigger Warning\\nIt’s horrible. It has destroyed my life.\\nI used to be happy as a child. I never believed I was ugly. Boys always liked me throughout elementary school. I was actually confident and liked how I looked.\\nThen I changed schools, and everything went downhill. People at this school had nothing nice to say about me. I got rude comments about my hair color and got told I was ugly and disgusting. People even made up a mean song about me. They would sing it whenever I was nearby. I got told that I had no friends, that I was fat, that the way I dressed was hideous, and that no one liked me.\\nI started to believe what people said. I started comparing myself to others, and noticing many flaws in my appearance that I had never paid attention to before.\\nBy the time I was in junior high, I was overly obsessed with my appearance. I would spend hours looking in the mirror and crying over how ugly I looked. I would spend the entire lunch hour at school just looking at my reflection in my phone camera, excessively brushing my hair and worrying that it looked frizzy. I became obsessed with trying to lighten my hair color, to the point where I literally ordered peroxide to bleach it at home. It didn’t even work though.\\nI still frequently got told that I was worthless and ugly. I started worrying about my nose being crooked, my neck being too fat, my eyes being too wide, my skin being too blotchy, my hairline looking weird, my chin being too big, my collarbones not showing enough, my lips being too small, my eyebrows being too thick, my smile being ugly, my cheeks being too fat, and having too many freckles.\\nI had been dealing with depression since middle school, but starting in junior high, it became mostly centered around my looks. My breaking point was when I got told that I looked like a 12-year-old.\\nI don’t wear anything besides skimpy shirts because I don’t want people to focus on my face. I have gotten made fun of for how I dress because sweatshirts and sweatpants are in style now, but I’m over here just wearing a camisole tank top and tight jeans. I only wear my hair in two styles because every other hairstyle looks too ugly on me. I only have a few clothes that I feel confident wearing.\\nI constantly feel sad about my face. I don’t think that anyone could ever love me. Only two people have liked me since I was in 3rd grade, and it was only because of my “personality.” One of these people that supposedly liked me kept comparing me to this other girl that he liked better. I also had a very toxic friend who was obsessed with her appearance, but in the complete opposite way that I was. I kind of have a feeling she was talking trash about me behind my back anyway.\\nI developed a bad habit (pretty much an addiction) for coping with my feelings. I don’t really want to go into detail, but I think you can figure out what I mean. My parents don’t trust me anymore and I’m not allowed to shut my door. They almost took my door off the hinges yesterday.\\nMy life basically sucks right now. I’ve got mountains of homework to do, my parents are threatening to send me back to in-person school, I had to cover my mirror in my room with a towel, I’ve probably got permanent scars on my arm for life, and I’m the only person that I know who has never had their first kiss.\\nI needed to write this anonymously. I don’t want anyone that I know to see my name on this answer. I’m hoping things will get better, but this has been going on for three years now. I’m afraid to go back to school because people still dislike me. I don’t know if I can take being told that I’m ugly anymore with breaking down crying. I just hope things change for the better. I don’t want to be alone forever.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ve probably had it since the age of 12, it has been a life-long thing.\\nWith BDD I think that:\\nThe source of my unhappiness about my appearance is just the fact that I am ugly. If my flaws that I see every day were not there, I would not have this problem.\\nBeing treated for BDD, is just accepting you for who you are. (Accepting that you are ugly and not being upset about it anymore).\\nI would like to be treated for BDD, I would like to no longer be upset about my appearance.\\nI find myself looking in the mirror/reflective surfaces at any opportunities. The reflection in car windows, puddles, shiny objects like cutlery, anything.\\nI check myself in the mirror so often just to make sure that my flaws are still there.\\nLooking in the mirror is addictive, even though it makes me feel extremely distressed and upset\\nI want to talk to people that I trust about my perceived flaws, but if they push me away/show any signs of not wanting to talk about it - I could feel depressed and alone for days.\\nBDD can be worse on some days than other days. But it is always there. I always have a nagging voice in my head telling me how ugly I am.\\nI think that BDD is just a sign of how vane I am, and I would never talk about BDD with people I don’t trust. I would feel highly embarrassed talking about it with anyone apart from my CLOSEST family members. That is the reason why I am posting this anonymously.\\nI am in a dilemma in that I want to talk to a doctor about my BDD, I want to be less upset about my appearance - but again, it is highly embarrassing and so far in my life I have not had the courage to see any doctors.\\nI think that all people around me do not understand BDD at all.\\nI have certain “triggers” like getting dressed in the morning (choosing what clothes to wear), looking in reflective surfaces, trying to put on makeup, trying to do my hair, which can all make my worries about my appearance seriously intense.\\nBDD can basically make me disabled for weeks. I do not want to go outside even onto a high street to go to the shops or whatever because I think that people will be looking at me and thinking about how hideous I look.\\nI avoid a lot of social events like parties.\\nI have lost all of my friends. I think this may be due to my BDD because BDD can often make me feel very withdrawn. It’s difficult for me to communicate with people because I am too busy comparing my appearance with theirs and worrying about what they think. For instance, I have a problem with my nose - I think it is way too big. If someone in a conversation starts touching their nose, I will think that the reason they are touching their nose is because they are thinking about how large my nose is.\\nI need people to communicate with. The more people float away from me, the worse my symptoms of BDD gets. These days, I have not had anyone to talk to which I believe has led me into depression. I feel incredibly isolated. Isolation, and BDD is a terrible combination and it has seriously affected my life.\\nWhat people without BDD can* think:\\nEveryone has anxiety about their appearance, therefore everyone has BDD/ BDD is not a real thing. (The truth is, BDD makes the anxiety far more intense and disables you in many ways).\\nBDD is just a problem with vanity.\\nIt’s easy to get over BDD - just stop looking in the mirror or whatever.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s hard to describe this but it’s been on my mind and I have nowhere else to go with this. \\n\\nThis is beyond pictures of videos, this is in real life. Not a day goes by where I don’t look at other women and think “she’s perfect”. Every single day, in person. It’s not a social media problem, it’s a problem I’ve had since long before social media was a thing. I don’t like when people tell me it’s all fake, it’s really not. I see beautiful women everyday, naturally and always have. My friends, family and I’m just an ogre, sometimes I pray to be taken out of my misery.\\n\\nEver since I was around 7 years old, I compared myself to other girls. This started with fashion catalogues where I would write lists of the pages the other young girl models were on and I’d write things like:\\n\\n1) “The model on page 7 has the perfect body. One day I can wear her clothes.”\\n2) “When I am pretty like the girl on page 4, I will wear those clothes.”\\n3) “When I lose 50 pounds, mommy will take me on a shopping spree.”\\n\\nOver the years this has progressed. One of my favorite hobbies has been to save pics of random girls/women as I was growing up that i knew were just much better than me. I would save them in hopes I could look like them one day. I don’t know why I would, but I dreamt of being that sort of perfect.\\n\\nNow at 28 years old, this hasn’t stopped and has worsened in many ways. I feel like an imposter around other women and often have thoughts of how I’m nothing and worth nothing. As a woman I know value should not be placed on looks but ive always been treated like I have no value because of mine. Everyday is the same. I am so lonely. I do not have fun. I am basically a prisoner in my own body and looks. I wish that there was a term for this outside of dysmorphia because I really actually feel as though I experience gender dysphoria, although I am the “correct” gender. I just don’t believe my body or looks match what it should be. \\n\\n\\nIt really hurts.\\n\\nI see a guy and research what his girlfriend or ex’s look like and obsess over how pretty and perfect they are. And just laugh to myself that I could never have any chance in life. I hate hurting myself this way but I’m so tired of being me. I’m so tired of this. I’m tired and I know I’ll never be wanted. \\n\\n\\nI just wish I didn’t wish to be another woman or girl. I’m not enough, when I’m me, I’m met with meanness. All the times people said things to me about my looks just because is enough to have a chip on my shoulder. I fantasize about being a beautiful woman so much that it takes up 100% of my day in every activity I do.</td>\n",

She was way shorter than me, with a tiny waist and huge huge butt. It made me so distressed and frustrated and obviously I couldn’t avoid her. I felt so much hurt and rage at myself knowing despite going to the gym for years and building over 10kg of muscle in my lower body I will NEVER look like that because of my genetics.

You develop suicidal thoughts and self harming thoughts on a regular basis because you hate the body that your in. You can become hysterical when looking in the mirror because in your eyes you look unlike other people around you as if you were alien. It angers you when people compliment you because you cant trust their opinion and you think they're lying. You feel paranoid in public because your looks are on your mind 24/7 and you think that others are judging you based on them. You're always locked away in the dark and you avoid leaving the house because you feel depressed and you get nervous around others. You are unable to make eye contact with other people. sometimes you think that you're the ugliest person in the world. You become physco and crazy because you're mind is fucked up and you're in constant war with your thoughts.\\nYeah...lovely stuff :)   \n",

Like when I look in the mirror for too long I become twisted and ugly. I cannot accept compliments, even from family, I always feel like I have somehow tricked everyone into thinking I’m a nice person, or I feel like people pity me so much to the point that they’d lie about my appearance as to not have to deal with me. I feel sickened at myself, and when I feel like I can’t find anything flattering to wear, I spiral and become anxious and sometimes depressed. I hate it. I feel like no matter what haircare/style/skincare I do I will always look and feel like shit. I want to be content with my body but I see so many girls that look good in their body types and clothes then I take a look at myself and I want to vomit because I feel like I should look like them or like if I had the money to dress like them I’d be pretty. Even if I did I’d still find something about myself to be disgusted or disappointed with. These are some of the rare picture I feel pretty in. Two of them have no filter. The filters make me feel like a fairy which I love, but it is pretty rare to get a photo of me that I don’t feel super uncomfortable in. I don’t want people taking pictures of me, not even my boyfriend, and if someone does take a picture of me I try and sit far enough back the the pixels blur out my face. I want it to get better but I feel like no matter how hard I try it never will.   \n",

I cannot escape the reality that I am a deformed, decrepit creature that oozes ugliness. As a result I compare myself to everyone I see, and can spend hours at a time just picking at my skin and measuring my fucked up disgusting nose and chin and the rest of my putrid face with my fingers. This is where the compulsions come into play into BDD. Contrary to belief, bdd is not related to eating disorders at all (although, yes, comorbidities can occur) the DSM-5 classifies BDD in the chapter of “Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders,” along with OCD and several other disorders. The obsessions and compulsions featured alongside BDD are to help deal with the somatic symptoms.\\nMost things trigger me:\\nany word to describe physical aesthetics\\nSeeing a woman with all the features I desire (even a man actually.)\\nMirrors\\nReflections\\nCompliments\\nPictures taken of myself\\nCameras aimed near or around me\\nSeeing someone with the traits I hate about myself\\nSymmetry in people's faces\\nAsymmetry in people's faces\\nThis disorder is horrible. It has ruined my enjoyment in so many situations over something seemingly small. From the moment I wake up to moment I go to bed, I cannot escape my thoughts.\\n“if I was prettier then I wouldn't have to feel like this\"\\n“my nose is huge, why does it have to have a bump in the middle?”\\n“why can’t I be beautiful?”\\n“why can’t I just look normal?”\\n“why do I look like this?”\\n“I'm a disgusting putrid looking monster\"\\nThese words always feel like slime in my brain, but they won't stop.\\nAnd when people become annoyed or tell you what you're seeing isn't true-\\n“they're lying\"\\n“they just don't want to admit I'm horrendous looking\"\\n“they're just being nice\"\\nI can never believe people when they say anything nice about my appearance. My brain is wired with reflexes to deny. In these moments, I seek comfort from the bdd community on various sites that use a hashtag. As I scroll I am bewildered. These people post pictures of their bodies? Some have selfies? I read their captions and sigh.\\n“I've been working so long to get the body I want\"\\n“Years ago I would've never taken a picture of my body without posing”\\nI see a lot of people using BDD as an interchangeable term with eating disorders. Time after time, I’ve seen people have posted these kinds of pictures and I see a #edrecovery following the #bdd. One of the specific requirements for receiving a diagnosis of bdd, is the Differentiation from an eating disorder: If the appearance preoccupations focus on being too fat or weighing too much, the clinician must determine that these concerns are not better explained by an eating disorder. If the patient’s only appearance concern focuses on excessive fat or weight, and the patient’s symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, then he or she should be diagnosed with an eating disorder, not BDD (taken from Diagnosing BDD - BDD)\\nSo when I go to these communities looking for solidarity and support- I am at times greeted with people who are ignorant about what bdd is and it saddens me because it reminds me, how far away of a time it is until people understand this disorder properly.\\nOverall?\\nI feel like shit every single day with this horrible disorder.   \n",
       "3     Trigger Warning\\nIt’s horrible. It has destroyed my life.\\nI used to be happy as a child. I never believed I was ugly. Boys always liked me throughout elementary school. I was actually confident and liked how I looked.\\nThen I changed schools, and everything went downhill. People at this school had nothing nice to say about me. I got rude comments about my hair color and got told I was ugly and disgusting. People even made up a mean song about me. They would sing it whenever I was nearby. I got told that I had no friends, that I was fat, that the way I dressed was hideous, and that no one liked me.\\nI started to believe what people said. I started comparing myself to others, and noticing many flaws in my appearance that I had never paid attention to before.\\nBy the time I was in junior high, I was overly obsessed with my appearance. I would spend hours looking in the mirror and crying over how ugly I looked. I would spend the entire lunch hour at school just looking at my reflection in my phone camera, excessively brushing my hair and worrying that it looked frizzy. I became obsessed with trying to lighten my hair color, to the point where I literally ordered peroxide to bleach it at home. It didn’t even work though.\\nI still frequently got told that I was worthless and ugly. I started worrying about my nose being crooked, my neck being too fat, my eyes being too wide, my skin being too blotchy, my hairline looking weird, my chin being too big, my collarbones not showing enough, my lips being too small, my eyebrows being too thick, my smile being ugly, my cheeks being too fat, and having too many freckles.\\nI had been dealing with depression since middle school, but starting in junior high, it became mostly centered around my looks. My breaking point was when I got told that I looked like a 12-year-old.\\nI don’t wear anything besides skimpy shirts because I don’t want people to focus on my face. I have gotten made fun of for how I dress because sweatshirts and sweatpants are in style now, but I’m over here just wearing a camisole tank top and tight jeans. I only wear my hair in two styles because every other hairstyle looks too ugly on me. I only have a few clothes that I feel confident wearing.\\nI constantly feel sad about my face. I don’t think that anyone could ever love me. Only two people have liked me since I was in 3rd grade, and it was only because of my “personality.” One of these people that supposedly liked me kept comparing me to this other girl that he liked better. I also had a very toxic friend who was obsessed with her appearance, but in the complete opposite way that I was. I kind of have a feeling she was talking trash about me behind my back anyway.\\nI developed a bad habit (pretty much an addiction) for coping with my feelings. I don’t really want to go into detail, but I think you can figure out what I mean. My parents don’t trust me anymore and I’m not allowed to shut my door. They almost took my door off the hinges yesterday.\\nMy life basically sucks right now. I’ve got mountains of homework to do, my parents are threatening to send me back to in-person school, I had to cover my mirror in my room with a towel, I’ve probably got permanent scars on my arm for life, and I’m the only person that I know who has never had their first kiss.\\nI needed to write this anonymously. I don’t want anyone that I know to see my name on this answer. I’m hoping things will get better, but this has been going on for three years now. I’m afraid to go back to school because people still dislike me. I don’t know if I can take being told that I’m ugly anymore with breaking down crying. I just hope things change for the better. I don’t want to be alone forever.   \n",

If my flaws that I see every day were not there, I would not have this problem.\\nBeing treated for BDD, is just accepting you for who you are. (Accepting that you are ugly and not being upset about it anymore).\\nI would like to be treated for BDD, I would like to no longer be upset about my appearance.\\nI find myself looking in the mirror/reflective surfaces at any opportunities. The reflection in car windows, puddles, shiny objects like cutlery, anything.\\nI check myself in the mirror so often just to make sure that my flaws are still there.\\nLooking in the mirror is addictive, even though it makes me feel extremely distressed and upset\\nI want to talk to people that I trust about my perceived flaws, but if they push me away/show any signs of not wanting to talk about it - I could feel depressed and alone for days.\\nBDD can be worse on some days than other days. But it is always there. I always have a nagging voice in my head telling me how ugly I am.\\nI think that BDD is just a sign of how vane I am, and I would never talk about BDD with people I don’t trust. I would feel highly embarrassed talking about it with anyone apart from my CLOSEST family members. That is the reason why I am posting this anonymously.\\nI am in a dilemma in that I want to talk to a doctor about my BDD, I want to be less upset about my appearance - but again, it is highly embarrassing and so far in my life I have not had the courage to see any doctors.\\nI think that all people around me do not understand BDD at all.\\nI have certain “triggers” like getting dressed in the morning (choosing what clothes to wear), looking in reflective surfaces, trying to put on makeup, trying to do my hair, which can all make my worries about my appearance seriously intense.\\nBDD can basically make me disabled for weeks. I do not want to go outside even onto a high street to go to the shops or whatever because I think that people will be looking at me and thinking about how hideous I look.\\nI avoid a lot of social events like parties.\\nI have lost all of my friends. I think this may be due to my BDD because BDD can often make me feel very withdrawn. It’s difficult for me to communicate with people because I am too busy comparing my appearance with theirs and worrying about what they think. For instance, I have a problem with my nose - I think it is way too big. If someone in a conversation starts touching their nose, I will think that the reason they are touching their nose is because they are thinking about how large my nose is.\\nI need people to communicate with. The more people float away from me, the worse my symptoms of BDD gets. These days, I have not had anyone to talk to which I believe has led me into depression. I feel incredibly isolated. Isolation, and BDD is a terrible combination and it has seriously affected my life.\\nWhat people without BDD can* think:\\nEveryone has anxiety about their appearance, therefore everyone has BDD/ BDD is not a real thing. (The truth is, BDD makes the anxiety far more intense and disables you in many ways).\\nBDD is just a problem with vanity.\\nIt’s easy to get over BDD - just stop looking in the mirror or whatever.   \n",

It genuinely makes me so angry when they do, and it’s always the same issues. \\n\\n>Oh they only like me and treat me that way cause I’m attractive. They don’t care about my hobbies and personality\\n\\nI could care less if people like me for my personality or hobbies. The only thing I’ve ever wanted is to be attractive looking and people think I’m attractive looking.\\n\\n>You can get sex easily, but getting and keeping relationships are hard\\n\\nPlease, all I’ve ever wanted was tons of sexual partners and hookups. I never even cared about having a relationship. \\n\\n>You get constant attention and it can be annoying\\n\\nTrust me, being completely invisible is 1,000 times worse.\\n\\n>We all get old and unattractive some time.\\n\\nWho the hell cares? I’d be more than happy having memories of how attractive I was and all got to do because of it. \\n\\nIf attractive men and I switched lives, they’d be *begging* to take their lives back after 24 hours. I’ve spent so much time trying to be attractive, and I could never get to it. I don’t know why I couldn’t be born with attractive facial features and be tall or at least average height. I’d throw my entire life away to be attractive.   \n",

Not a day goes by where I don’t look at other women and think “she’s perfect”. Every single day, in person. It’s not a social media problem, it’s a problem I’ve had since long before social media was a thing. I don’t like when people tell me it’s all fake, it’s really not. I see beautiful women everyday, naturally and always have. My friends, family and I’m just an ogre, sometimes I pray to be taken out of my misery.\\n\\nEver since I was around 7 years old, I compared myself to other girls. This started with fashion catalogues where I would write lists of the pages the other young girl models were on and I’d write things like:\\n\\n1) “The model on page 7 has the perfect body. One day I can wear her clothes.”\\n2) “When I am pretty like the girl on page 4, I will wear those clothes.”\\n3) “When I lose 50 pounds, mommy will take me on a shopping spree.”\\n\\nOver the years this has progressed. One of my favorite hobbies has been to save pics of random girls/women as I was growing up that i knew were just much better than me. I would save them in hopes I could look like them one day. I don’t know why I would, but I dreamt of being that sort of perfect.\\n\\nNow at 28 years old, this hasn’t stopped and has worsened in many ways. I feel like an imposter around other women and often have thoughts of how I’m nothing and worth nothing. As a woman I know value should not be placed on looks but ive always been treated like I have no value because of mine. Everyday is the same. I am so lonely. I do not have fun. I am basically a prisoner in my own body and looks. I wish that there was a term for this outside of dysmorphia because I really actually feel as though I experience gender dysphoria, although I am the “correct” gender. I just don’t believe my body or looks match what it should be. \\n\\n\\nIt really hurts.\\n\\nI see a guy and research what his girlfriend or ex’s look like and obsess over how pretty and perfect they are. And just laugh to myself that I could never have any chance in life. I hate hurting myself this way but I’m so tired of being me. I’m so tired of this. I’m tired and I know I’ll never be wanted. \\n\\n\\nI just wish I didn’t wish to be another woman or girl. I’m not enough, when I’m me, I’m met with meanness. All the times people said things to me about my looks just because is enough to have a chip on my shoulder. I fantasize about being a beautiful woman so much that it takes up 100% of my day in every activity I do.   \n",

I was at work and a girl came in my age who had everything I wish I was. She was way shorter than me, with a tiny waist and huge huge butt. It made me so distressed and frustrated and obviously I couldn’t avoid her. I felt so much hurt and rage at myself knowing despite going to the gym for years and building over 10kg of muscle in my lower body I will NEVER look like that because of my genetics.

Literally everything. And boy he was a troubled kid back then. Quite insecure. But he kept trying. Never feared to take on his limitations and always pushed his boundaries.\\nI must say after two years he is a person with the most positive outlook towards life. Is in a serious relationship with a girl everyone adores. And one of the most successful amongst all my friends.\\nTalking with him is a real treat. so fresh and rejuvenating always.(never disappoints me. Never Ever) I feel the reason is he has ventured into such realms of emotions where normal people do not even try to go.

       "      <td>31.1.2023\\nHello\\nBipolar disorder BPAD is a mood disorder previous known as manic depression. Persons suffering from this disorder have their mood fluctuating from normal to mania to depression to normal in a cycle. There are a few types of BPAD like bipolar 1, bipolar 2, Cyclothymia, Rapid cycling bipolar, etc.\\nThe main difference between Clinical Depression and Bipolar Disorder is in Bipolar the patient suffers atleast once from full blown Mania. This is the reason majority of cases of bipolar are mis-diagnosed as depression and only after months or even years when the patient suffers from mania, the correct diagnosis is made.\\nLike other mental health disorders, Bipolar Disorder cannot be cured or healed but can be overcome and managed by medical treatment. For this psychiatric medicines and psychotherapy are required.\\nAs each person is different, BPAD affects everyone differently. Hence the treating psychiatrist does not know which psychotropic medicines will be effective. So medicines are prescribed on trial and error basis. Hence it takes some time for the patient to get the correct combination of medicines in the right dose. Here psychotherapy is quiet useful to treat the cognitive biases or distorted thoughts. The patients thoughts, emotions, and feelings baggage has to be rationalised and this is done by the therapist in the talk therapy that the patient undergoes. Also the patient learns coping skills for the symptoms of the illness and side-effects of the medicines from the therapist.\\nSo for a person having bipolar disorder, taking proper medical treatment is very essential to manage the illness. If the patient also increases his psycoknowledge about this illness, from all available sources, it is beneficial for them to reach stability in life.\\nAll the best.</td>\n",

Diabetes is an established chemical imbalance; bipolar disorder is not, despite what you may have heard. No brain chemical imbalance has ever been reliably established in a single person with bipolar disorder - ever.\\nMyth #2: Recovery from bipolar disorder never happens, cannot happen.\\nThis myth is often erroneously linked to the first myth above; it is often asserted that, just like no one recovers from diabetes, no one recovers from bipolar disorder.\\nI personally know over two dozen people who have made full recoveries from bipolar disorder. I have worked with several people with established diagnoses of bipolar disorder who have made full recoveries.\\nI am not suggesting that the process of recovery is easy, or that anyone reading this should decide to stop or reduce their medication.\\nBut anyone who tells you that recovery from bipolar disorder does not and cannot happen is misinforming you, regardless of the fact that they do not mean to misinform.</td>\n",

       "      <td>As others have said, Find the medication that works for you. I’ve lived with bipolar ii my entire life. My parents will comment on how it was very hard to put me to sleep as a baby, and also that I was a “serious” child. Basically hypomanic and depressive cycles. I lived with these cycles from early childhood into my late 30s before I found a psychiatrist who helped me treat it. Over that time I had terrible weeks or months and manic weeks or months, with periods of normalcy. When I was hypomanic or normal I was very successful. I got too grades, had lots of friends, got married, started two businesses, ran a third, etc. but when the depressive spells hit it would all fall down. I dropped out of college twice, from very good schools. My businesses foundered and failed when I struggled to get out of bed for weeks. I ruined a marriage. In addition to the depressive states, during the hypomanic states I would scheme and dream and spend money I didn’t have and do drugs and get into toxic relationships. Then the tide would turn and I’d feel crushing guilt and try to pick up the pieces of the mess id just made. I didn’t understand why life could be so hard. I lived the hypomanic spells because I felt like I was the life of the party, getting so much more done than the people around me. But it was always two steps forward, three steps back . A few years ago I got diagnosed and put on a combination of Lamotrigine and adderal (I have adhd as well) my life is pretty stable now, and has been for almost two years. I found the partner of my dreams, a good job with structure. I feel good. I have lots of friends who love me for who I am, and not for the bursts of excess and charisma I used to experience. Before I got medicated I was getting pretty close to suicide. The cycles were coming faster, sometimes switching back and forth daily, and I was starting to feel insane.\\nget medicated. You can work on developing a healthy lifestyle and habits afterward, because without medication any positive work will be undone on your next cycle.\\nI guess if you are a world renowned artist contributing major works in your field, maybe not, a lot of great music, novels, poems, paintings, etc have come from people with bipolar, but chances are pretty good you’ll end up killing your self.\\ngood luck, please take care of yourself.</td>\n",

My therapist absolutely does not say things like this maliciously, it's just a thing I think a lot of people thinks sounds comforting. Imagine saying \"Think of how lucky you are! It could be so much worse!\" to someone who just lost a toe to diabetes. Of course they're glad they didn't lose a whole leg, but it also sucks a lot to lose a toe. Inner peace is my lost toe.

I would hear whispering and screaming and I couldn’t trust what was real and what wasn’t anymore. I would see scary faces and dark shadows, I would hallucinate animals too.

It really means a lot to me. I went to bed early yesterday, when this post had like 15 upvotes, I never expected it to get nearly 500 upvotes and lots of comments! (Also long time lurker here, this was my first post ever.) Right now I'm getting ready to go to my second day. I'll be back home in like 9 hours from now and then I'll respond to the comments as good as I can. If you have any particular questions, just go ahead and ask them. Happy to help.\\n\\nEdit 2 : Just had a really long (and great) second day and I replied to a good amount of comments. If you people want to know specific things about my internship or how it is to have seen both sides, or some sort of updates once in a while, feel free to ask/say so. These 2 first days have been pretty overwhelming, but I'm really happy that I could reply to your great comments so I can talk about it. You're all great people.

Sustained use of medicines.\\nAnd councelling. Councelling helps a lot. It helps in developing a rational outlook towards situations we deal with in day to day life. And that is what is needed for curing bipolar disorder.\\nIt is a long process. But done with conviction can transform your personality and bring awesomeness to it.\\nI have a friend who suffered from bipolar disorder (or multipolar as he comically used to describe it). I know how much he suffered. I used to sit with him whole nights discussing issues like emotions, anger, material needs, people, their perceptions, behaviours, love, women, sex.. Literally everything. And boy he was a troubled kid back then. Quite insecure. But he kept trying. Never feared to take on his limitations and always pushed his boundaries.\\nI must say after two years he is a person with the most positive outlook towards life. Is in a serious relationship with a girl everyone adores. And one of the most successful amongst all my friends.\\nTalking with him is a real treat. so fresh and rejuvenating always.(never disappoints me. Never Ever) I feel the reason is he has ventured into such realms of emotions where normal people do not even try to go. And has a broader understanding of himself and his emotions.(a sign of high EQ). Hence he always gives me the perfect and most rational solution whenever I feel disturbed or down.\\nBipolar disorder is sure a tough situation to handle. But with consistent efforts and faith the tables can be turned. And for a greater good. Not only for oneself but also for people surrounding.   \n",

Persons suffering from this disorder have their mood fluctuating from normal to mania to depression to normal in a cycle. There are a few types of BPAD like bipolar 1, bipolar 2, Cyclothymia, Rapid cycling bipolar, etc.\\nThe main difference between Clinical Depression and Bipolar Disorder is in Bipolar the patient suffers atleast once from full blown Mania. This is the reason majority of cases of bipolar are mis-diagnosed as depression and only after months or even years when the patient suffers from mania, the correct diagnosis is made.\\nLike other mental health disorders, Bipolar Disorder cannot be cured or healed but can be overcome and managed by medical treatment. For this psychiatric medicines and psychotherapy are required.\\nAs each person is different, BPAD affects everyone differently. Hence the treating psychiatrist does not know which psychotropic medicines will be effective. So medicines are prescribed on trial and error basis. Hence it takes some time for the patient to get the correct combination of medicines in the right dose. Here psychotherapy is quiet useful to treat the cognitive biases or distorted thoughts. The patients thoughts, emotions, and feelings baggage has to be rationalised and this is done by the therapist in the talk therapy that the patient undergoes. Also the patient learns coping skills for the symptoms of the illness and side-effects of the medicines from the therapist.\\nSo for a person having bipolar disorder, taking proper medical treatment is very essential to manage the illness. If the patient also increases his psycoknowledge about this illness, from all available sources, it is beneficial for them to reach stability in life.\\nAll the best.   \n",

Diabetes is an established chemical imbalance; bipolar disorder is not, despite what you may have heard. No brain chemical imbalance has ever been reliably established in a single person with bipolar disorder - ever.\\nMyth #2: Recovery from bipolar disorder never happens, cannot happen.\\nThis myth is often erroneously linked to the first myth above; it is often asserted that, just like no one recovers from diabetes, no one recovers from bipolar disorder.\\nI personally know over two dozen people who have made full recoveries from bipolar disorder. I have worked with several people with established diagnoses of bipolar disorder who have made full recoveries.\\nI am not suggesting that the process of recovery is easy, or that anyone reading this should decide to stop or reduce their medication.\\nBut anyone who tells you that recovery from bipolar disorder does not and cannot happen is misinforming you, regardless of the fact that they do not mean to misinform.   \n",

Anxiety is usually overlooked, but a characteristic trait of Bipolar is that the person can have episodes of severe Anxiety and panic disorder.\\nNow the depression and Mania experienced by a person with bipolar is not something we normal people can comprehend. It is not your Monday Blue or your sadness due to a breakup or your one of the low mood days. The depression in bipolar can be devastating and disabling and the person is unable to get up from bed, no mood to go to work, no mood to take bath or change clothes, Feels Hopeless and lost, can be extremely irritable, may try to commit suicide. It is Extreme\\nMost people with Bipolar have 2 episodes per year. 4 Months of Mania and 6 months of depression called classic cycling.\\nA person can having recurring depression and recurring mania as well.\\nA person can have more than 4 episodes per year called rapid cycling.\\nA person can switch between mania and depression in a single day called ultra rapid cycling.\\nBipolar is Life Long.\\nBipolar cannot be Cured.\\nNot everyone with Bipolar suffer equally, It depends on severity, the spectrum over which there is impact, comorbid conditions and how much support the person receives.\\nBipolar can be very well managed with discipline and medication that control the symptoms.\\nIt all depends on how disciplined you are with your medication and doctor visit.\\nBipolar treatment can sometimes be extremely expensive and the illness is extremely disabling. So the person needs a ton of support from family.\\nMake a support group or circle of people who understand your illness and stay away from Junk ass Jokers who think you are a freak. Such people are no good to society.\\nCaregivers (This is Not for the person diagnosed with Bipolar) please take Ashwagandha, A magic Herb that help reduce stress and help you cope with the difficulties ahead.   \n",
       "4     As others have said, Find the medication that works for you. I’ve lived with bipolar ii my entire life. My parents will comment on how it was very hard to put me to sleep as a baby, and also that I was a “serious” child. Basically hypomanic and depressive cycles. I lived with these cycles from early childhood into my late 30s before I found a psychiatrist who helped me treat it. Over that time I had terrible weeks or months and manic weeks or months, with periods of normalcy. When I was hypomanic or normal I was very successful. I got too grades, had lots of friends, got married, started two businesses, ran a third, etc. but when the depressive spells hit it would all fall down. I dropped out of college twice, from very good schools. My businesses foundered and failed when I struggled to get out of bed for weeks. I ruined a marriage. In addition to the depressive states, during the hypomanic states I would scheme and dream and spend money I didn’t have and do drugs and get into toxic relationships. Then the tide would turn and I’d feel crushing guilt and try to pick up the pieces of the mess id just made. I didn’t understand why life could be so hard. I lived the hypomanic spells because I felt like I was the life of the party, getting so much more done than the people around me. But it was always two steps forward, three steps back . A few years ago I got diagnosed and put on a combination of Lamotrigine and adderal (I have adhd as well) my life is pretty stable now, and has been for almost two years. I found the partner of my dreams, a good job with structure. I feel good. I have lots of friends who love me for who I am, and not for the bursts of excess and charisma I used to experience. Before I got medicated I was getting pretty close to suicide. The cycles were coming faster, sometimes switching back and forth daily, and I was starting to feel insane.\\nget medicated. You can work on developing a healthy lifestyle and habits afterward, because without medication any positive work will be undone on your next cycle.\\nI guess if you are a world renowned artist contributing major works in your field, maybe not, a lot of great music, novels, poems, paintings, etc have come from people with bipolar, but chances are pretty good you’ll end up killing your self.\\ngood luck, please take care of yourself.   \n",

It makes it feel like she and no else understands how fucking hard it is to drive to work in a depressive episode without purposefully crashing my car or to not quit my job in a manic episode and go live in a treehouse with a harem of strange men selling drugs for a living. I'm grateful that even at my worst with psychosis, I'm still of sound enough mind to not do that stuff as much as I convince myself that's the only way to be happy and be myself, but it's STILL not comforting to hear that those thought patterns \"aren't that bad\".  \\n\\nJust a small rant I had to get out. Shout out to my fellow high functionals.\\n\\nEDIT TO ADD thanks for sharing all your own experiences. My therapist absolutely does not say things like this maliciously, it's just a thing I think a lot of people thinks sounds comforting. Imagine saying \"Think of how lucky you are! It could be so much worse!\" to someone who just lost a toe to diabetes. Of course they're glad they didn't lose a whole leg, but it also sucks a lot to lose a toe. Inner peace is my lost toe. Anyway, this therapist doesn't know much about bipolar, so I am going back to the drawing board in the near future to find someone I relate to a little more as far as the darker goings on in my head. Thanks again everyone.   \n",

I slipped into mania gradually, then it turned into psychosis during my first ever mania episode. I believed crazy things that had no basis in reality, I even developed delusions about my loved ones which I am sad about. I would hear whispering and screaming and I couldn’t trust what was real and what wasn’t anymore. I would see scary faces and dark shadows, I would hallucinate animals too. I even experienced olfactory hallucinations, at one point I thought I could smell a gas leak and my mother said she couldn’t smell anything and it was fine, but I was so worried I called a gas company up and they came and knew I was crazy lol. \\n\\nIt is so scary to completely lose touch with reality and have to second guess yourself all the time.

I went to bed early yesterday, when this post had like 15 upvotes, I never expected it to get nearly 500 upvotes and lots of comments! (Also long time lurker here, this was my first post ever.) Right now I'm getting ready to go to my second day. I'll be back home in like 9 hours from now and then I'll respond to the comments as good as I can. If you have any particular questions, just go ahead and ask them. Happy to help.\\n\\nEdit 2 : Just had a really long (and great) second day and I replied to a good amount of comments. If you people want to know specific things about my internship or how it is to have seen both sides, or some sort of updates once in a while, feel free to ask/say so. These 2 first days have been pretty overwhelming, but I'm really happy that I could reply to your great comments so I can talk about it. You're all great people.

       "      <td>Not an expert, but i did had an eating disorder. I recovered though! One of the main roots itself is, overthinking. I didn’t have any friends when i first set foot in a new school after graduating. One fact is, my mother died the day before my graduate. So of course i had many things to think about. Hell, i even thought my father killed my mom because of her decomposing body bruising purple. Once i was in the new school, many people weren’t talking to me. They were all ignoring me. I looked at them and noticed that they were skinnier and i was fat. I had a binge eating disorder after her death by the way!\\nSo i thought, if i were to get skinnier, maybe ill be as pretty as them. And maybe they’ll like me.\\nStarted eating 700 calories a day, loosing 32 kilograms. I was 75 kg, then i was 43 kg. I think it took about 9 months-12 months??\\nCried when given a plate of huge amounts of food because i was scared of getting fat again, needed my dad beside me when i eat and he’ll get mad at me when i only ate 1/5 of the food.\\nAnd… time for the rest of root! B-e-a-u-t-y-s-t-a-n-d-a-r-d-s. Beauty standards! Comparison! Society itself. People are judgmental. Most women will compare to what they see in social media, seeing how people were so skinny, pretty, and perfect. They would strive to be them.\\nTried to get the “hour glass body” people wanted, but couldn’t because i has a wide ribcage,(from genetics, from my mom! Love!)\\nAnd yeah, honestly. It’s just society itself, overthinking, comparison, traumatic experience, low self confidence and self esteem, people with zero self respect!</td>\n",

I still think I was a healthy kid, a little overweight but I wasn’t fat.\\nI know my mom didn’t mean it in a bad way but maybe the few times she called me chubby got stuck in my mind. She never told me to stop eating or to watch what I eat, she just said that I was getting a little bigger. And then from a very young age, I started comparing myself to skinnier girls, and immediately thought they were prettier or worth more than me. It sucks, yeah. I think I was probably like in 4th grade.\\nAnd when I got older, my family members (specific cousin OR aunt/uncle) would call me fat or call me out if I was gaining weight. I hated it. I hate going to family parties just because of that. It makes me so anxious and it made me hate them. I hate people who comment on other people’s body.\\nAnd then, when I developed an eating disorder it made me feel good and powerful and strong, I was finally able to control something in my life when everything else was breaking and falling but this kept me going. for a long time.\\nSo it might start with a little comment from a random person and then you’re stuck with it for the rest of your life.\\nPeople, watch your mouth.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’m not sure that anyone can point to just one cause with any certainty, because the etiology of eating disorders like many other mental illnesses, is not well understood, although there are many theories as to why they may happen. The “cause” is probably multifactorial and may be different things for different people. However, an eating disorder, which is considered to be the most lethal of all mental illnesses because of the severe medical consequences that can occur, is a very difficult condition with which some people struggle.\\nThe roots of an eating disorder may be genetic or biological. It may be how you respond to stress or anxiety. It may be a response to anxiety or to deprivation or both. It may stem from trauma or abuse and be a reaction to negative life events/circumstances. It may provide someone with a sense of control, which can be scarce in our world. It may have to do with an absence of connection to a caretaker in early childhood, poor attachment, or to a lack of self soothing skills. It is certainly supported and reinforced by the pressures of a weight or thinness obsessed culture that values impossibly thin images of women over healthier and more realistic presentations. It is reinforced by peer pressure, a desire to fit in, be accepted, and be admired. It can also be the result of low self esteem, a poor sense of identity and self worth, and of distorted thinking, such as in body dysmorphic disorder in which people perceive themselves to be “fat,” (amongst other things) when in fact, they are not.\\nSadly, like many other addictive-type behaviors, what starts out as something in which someone engages only occasionally, can become increasingly more frequent until it becomes a habit that the person finds incredibly hard to break without help and support from a therapist or treatment program. Someone with an eating disorder may feel a need to keep the disorder a secret from other people, which can become a problem in and of itself, and may feel deep shame about revealing all they go through with the disorder, which further encourages them to keep the eating disorder a secret.\\nAs mentioned, eating disorders can have serious medical consequences and often what happens is that once someone else notices the problem, the person with the disorder may lose control of the situation and be hospitalized or put into a treatment program for their own safety, which can be very upsetting for the person with the disorder.</td>\n",

The rest of the factors (called precipitants) often just give push to the person to encounter the disorder. Also, it is said that media is also to be blamed. Genetics still remain a prime cause.\\nWhile media influence is recognized as a complicating factor, it isn't considered an underlying cause of eating disorder development in individuals.

(from the Internet)\\nThe short answer to what contributes to Anorexia Nervosa is a sense of lack of control over most of the persons life, so they will control the one thing they can: the food they put into their mouth.\\nWith regard to overeating, my personal experience is a kind of lack of power or control over things going on around me. Both of my parents were alcoholics. So, they were not the greatest role models of how to deal with life. Nor were they available at all to help me (also an only child). I learned early that eating a lot made me feel better. It can almost be like a drug. Feeling very full is comforting.\\nFrankly, I think a lot of people “suffer” from living in the United States.

I recovered though! One of the main roots itself is, overthinking. I didn’t have any friends when i first set foot in a new school after graduating. One fact is, my mother died the day before my graduate. So of course i had many things to think about. Hell, i even thought my father killed my mom because of her decomposing body bruising purple. Once i was in the new school, many people weren’t talking to me. They were all ignoring me. I looked at them and noticed that they were skinnier and i was fat. I had a binge eating disorder after her death by the way!\\nSo i thought, if i were to get skinnier, maybe ill be as pretty as them. And maybe they’ll like me.\\nStarted eating 700 calories a day, loosing 32 kilograms. I was 75 kg, then i was 43 kg. I think it took about 9 months-12 months??\\nCried when given a plate of huge amounts of food because i was scared of getting fat again, needed my dad beside me when i eat and he’ll get mad at me when i only ate 1/5 of the food.\\nAnd… time for the rest of root! B-e-a-u-t-y-s-t-a-n-d-a-r-d-s. Beauty standards! Comparison! Society itself. People are judgmental. Most women will compare to what they see in social media, seeing how people were so skinny, pretty, and perfect. They would strive to be them.\\nTried to get the “hour glass body” people wanted, but couldn’t because i has a wide ribcage,(from genetics, from my mom! Love!)\\nAnd yeah, honestly. It’s just society itself, overthinking, comparison, traumatic experience, low self confidence and self esteem, people with zero self respect!   \n",

It made me feel powerful.\\nBut it wouldn’t have started if from a young age I wasn’t called chubby or fat by family members. I still think I was a healthy kid, a little overweight but I wasn’t fat.\\nI know my mom didn’t mean it in a bad way but maybe the few times she called me chubby got stuck in my mind. She never told me to stop eating or to watch what I eat, she just said that I was getting a little bigger. And then from a very young age, I started comparing myself to skinnier girls, and immediately thought they were prettier or worth more than me. It sucks, yeah. I think I was probably like in 4th grade.\\nAnd when I got older, my family members (specific cousin OR aunt/uncle) would call me fat or call me out if I was gaining weight. I hated it. I hate going to family parties just because of that. It makes me so anxious and it made me hate them. I hate people who comment on other people’s body.\\nAnd then, when I developed an eating disorder it made me feel good and powerful and strong, I was finally able to control something in my life when everything else was breaking and falling but this kept me going. for a long time.\\nSo it might start with a little comment from a random person and then you’re stuck with it for the rest of your life.\\nPeople, watch your mouth.   \n",
       "2     I’m not sure that anyone can point to just one cause with any certainty, because the etiology of eating disorders like many other mental illnesses, is not well understood, although there are many theories as to why they may happen. The “cause” is probably multifactorial and may be different things for different people. However, an eating disorder, which is considered to be the most lethal of all mental illnesses because of the severe medical consequences that can occur, is a very difficult condition with which some people struggle.\\nThe roots of an eating disorder may be genetic or biological. It may be how you respond to stress or anxiety. It may be a response to anxiety or to deprivation or both. It may stem from trauma or abuse and be a reaction to negative life events/circumstances. It may provide someone with a sense of control, which can be scarce in our world. It may have to do with an absence of connection to a caretaker in early childhood, poor attachment, or to a lack of self soothing skills. It is certainly supported and reinforced by the pressures of a weight or thinness obsessed culture that values impossibly thin images of women over healthier and more realistic presentations. It is reinforced by peer pressure, a desire to fit in, be accepted, and be admired. It can also be the result of low self esteem, a poor sense of identity and self worth, and of distorted thinking, such as in body dysmorphic disorder in which people perceive themselves to be “fat,” (amongst other things) when in fact, they are not.\\nSadly, like many other addictive-type behaviors, what starts out as something in which someone engages only occasionally, can become increasingly more frequent until it becomes a habit that the person finds incredibly hard to break without help and support from a therapist or treatment program. Someone with an eating disorder may feel a need to keep the disorder a secret from other people, which can become a problem in and of itself, and may feel deep shame about revealing all they go through with the disorder, which further encourages them to keep the eating disorder a secret.\\nAs mentioned, eating disorders can have serious medical consequences and often what happens is that once someone else notices the problem, the person with the disorder may lose control of the situation and be hospitalized or put into a treatment program for their own safety, which can be very upsetting for the person with the disorder.   \n",

For getting it treated, we should know what the causes of eating disorders are, not just to treat ourselves or those suffering around us, but also to avoid getting into this illness.\\nHere is the list of causes of eating disorder:\\nGenes\\nAbuse\\nBullying\\nStress\\nDieting\\nLife transitions/changes\\nMental Illness\\nPuberty\\nWeight stigma\\nNOTE: Genes don’t determine mostly who will get the disorder. The rest of the factors (called precipitants) often just give push to the person to encounter the disorder. Also, it is said that media is also to be blamed. Genetics still remain a prime cause.\\nWhile media influence is recognized as a complicating factor, it isn't considered an underlying cause of eating disorder development in individuals. Ultimately, a person must also have a genetic vulnerability in order for eating disorders to develop.\\nSource: Very Well Minds\\nFor more information on mental health and for seeking help, make sure to reach out or seek help here: Login • Instagram   \n",

It appears you may have received some responses about people who eat too much. Let’s talk about people who eat too little\\nThe causes that may contribute to a person developing anorexia nervosa include: Psychological factors, such as a high level of perfectionism or obsessive-compulsive personality traits, feeling limited control in life and low self-esteem, a tendency towards depression and anxiety and a poor reaction to stress. (from the Internet)\\nThe short answer to what contributes to Anorexia Nervosa is a sense of lack of control over most of the persons life, so they will control the one thing they can: the food they put into their mouth.\\nWith regard to overeating, my personal experience is a kind of lack of power or control over things going on around me. Both of my parents were alcoholics. So, they were not the greatest role models of how to deal with life. Nor were they available at all to help me (also an only child). I learned early that eating a lot made me feel better. It can almost be like a drug. Feeling very full is comforting.\\nFrankly, I think a lot of people “suffer” from living in the United States. On one hand, people are bombarded with information about eating this or that. On the other hand, the pressure to be thin is ridiculous. So, for some people, bulimia is the answer.   \n",

I’ve been working with an RD since October and an eating disorder therapist since January. The last six months, my dietician has been having me do intuitive eating which has definitely improved my relationship with food. I’m roughly 5’6” and overweight. \\n\\nI have told both my therapist and dietician I want to know what type of eating disorder I have.. so I can better understand my triggers, thought process,  explain this to my boyfriend who just wants to help me and understand, and continue my journey on a road to recovery. \\n\\nIs it common practice for health professionals to not tell you what type of eating disorder you have during recovery? \\n\\nFor reference, I’m 30. I was borderline anorexic in middle school- high school. close to bulimic in college (throwing up after drinking, starving myself, using water pills and laxatives if I overate). and in my 20s I had some characteristics of binge eating disorder behaviors, starving myself a while.. then binging hard and gaining everything back plus some repeatedly.\\n\\nMy eating disorder in the past was never “severe” enough to fit into any box.. I was just diagnosed officially with an eating disorder last year. But fuck. It would just be so helpful to have a diagnosis so I can understand myself better, and be more aware of bad behaviors or when I’m starting to spiral. Is this normal at this stage in treatment to not know the type of eating disorder I have?   \n",

I just need advice on what to do. I’m 12 if that matters - I don’t use Reddit I just needed some advice and idk where else to put this. My sister isn’t letting me eat dinner and idk what to do, maybe she’ll stop but she did it today and I’m scared she won’t let me. I have an ED but it’s not like I eat HER stuff. I don’t know what she’s doing, I would make myself something but whenever I go into the kitchen she belittles me and whenever I come down she says “are you going to eat chips?” In like a mocking way. She makes me feel so ugly and disgusting and she’s part of the reason my other sister got an ED. I don’t know what to do I can’t distance myself from her either. Is there advice anyone could give me? Thanks for reading. Also if this gets taken down I totally understand I’m a new user of Reddit so idk what’s going on lol.\\n\\nUpdate: Ty for all the kind words, I’ve realized success is the best revenge is by working on myself I can prove to her that nothing she says has an effect on me. She’s been at work lately so I haven’t had to follow any advice but if she does it again I will follow your advice for sure! If this happens again I’ll post another update or something, I wasn’t really expecting anyone to see this or relate but I’m happy we can all get through things together. Ty again! ❤️ - I’m getting healthier day by day. 😄   \n",

She doesn't feel comfortable telling her parents and she only told me because she was upset. I want to help her but I don't know where to start. She has never had to most stable home life as her parents are divorced. She has moved around alot and it's really welcome at her mom because of her step-dad. I just want to do anything to help her and I know her parents won't take it seriously. Her Dad doesn't even take her period pain seriously when she is passing out at school from it. What do I do? Her parents don't care and she needs help. How do I help her¿   \n",

To extreme empaths like this, everything is alive, they affect everything in some way, and throwing them out is like leaving your loved ones in prison to rot. Objects have more life than humans, even. Objects don’t commit murder, or rob innocent people. So what did they ever do to be thrown out? They are at our mercy. It’s our choice. Those who ponder over it too much get called hoarders.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Loss can bring on hoarding disorder. When a person loses someone that they were very close to, a parent, spouse or a child, they try to fill that ache in their heart with stuff. Stress can also. Of course there are some mental health diagnosis that can include hoarding symptoms too. Paranoid Schizophrenia for one. Depression and anxiety disorder as well as ADHD can have symptoms of hoarding behavior. A person’s environment and what was going on in life need to be factored in. If a person grew up in a hoarding environment they are more likely to hoard. I know people who were discharged from institutions to community living often hoarded socks and snacks in their pillow cases. In the institutions everything was shared so this is the first time people had their own belongings. Probably more of a hide than a hoard. Also, people who grew up in war times or during the depression had the tendency to hoard. Probably to not waste and to make sure they had things when they needed them. Hoarding disorder is not an old diagnosis so many people back in those days were not aware they had a hoarding disorder.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hoarding is a type of mental illness. What causes any mental illness? Sometimes a cause can be found - such as with PTSD, which happens after a person suffers a very traumatic event. Other times a person is simply born with a brain that doesn’t function properly - and I don’t mean that in a cruel way. People born with diabetes have a pancreas that doesn’t function properly, some mental illnesses are just the same, only with the brain. Sometimes it’s a combination - a person might have Obsessive/Compulsive tendencies and then they experience something traumatic, such as losing a child or a divorce, and the tendencies become a full-blown mental illness.\\nI don’t think there is any way to prevent hoarding, any more than there is a way to prevent other types of OCD. The TREATMENT for hoarding is very, very difficult because the person needs to WANT to stop hoarding, and most hoarders simply do not see the harm in what they are doing, so they don’t want to stop.\\nThe families and friends of hoarders tend to feel that the hoarder is choosing their ‘junk’ over their loved ones. The hoarders just don’t see it that way - they can’t, they are sick. Hoarding is tragic and extremely damaging to everyone involved and so far there is no really good treatment unless the hoarder WANTS to change, and even then, it’s very hard.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Genetics can play a part, even just by repetition of a lived experience, but essentially the hoarding is a response to loss or trauma. Failure to move on, can be reflected by a failure to move things on, and things lost can be over-compensated for by things found and gathered. The paralysis of depression can lead to a mental log jamb which is then replicated in the physical surroundings. The effect of so much clutter and junk, or stuff, can be to create a defensive wall against the outside world.\\nSo usually the hoarding is a neurotic compulsion, triggered by trauma, as an aberrant defence mechanism, but it soon becomes a reward punishment cycle which feeds in on itself, becoming a trauma in and of itself.\\nNeediness comes to mind, where the need is not met, so the stuff becomes the next best available option, albeit a dysfunctional option. Similar to an addiction.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Back in March, I had posted about some progress I had made with my bedroom. I have made a little more progress in the last two months, so I figured I would share again. I haven’t completely finished cleaning and still need to organize some things and get rid of some things, but I’m somewhat content with the current state of the room.\\n\\n[Progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/OhHaIT1)\\n\\nA little background on and things I have discovered about myself for anyone who is interested:\\n\\nI was, like many people, laid off in March and, honestly, this has been the first time in my life where I have felt in control about myself and my life.\\n\\nWhen I was young (ages 5-11), I was sexually abused by my great-uncle, who lived with my grandmother. I didn’t understand what was happening until I was about eight or nine and, by then, my grandmother was very sick and I was afraid that, if I said anything, I would never get to go to her house again. I went to her house every day after school and every weekday during the summer and she was and always will be my favorite person in the world. She passed away when I was 11 and, when I started middle school the next year, my parents decided that I was old enough to stay home alone after school. My great-uncle passed away a few years later and this is the first time I have ever mentioned the abuse to anybody.\\n\\nWhen I was in high school, I was in a bad relationship with somebody that assaulted me. When he broke up with me, he told our mutual friends (which was the vast majority of my friends) that I was crazy and a slut and I graduated high school with no friends. One of his friends constantly harassed and poked fun at me for nearly everything I did and another told me that he could rape me and throw my body in a river and nobody would care. High school was great.\\n\\nAfter my grandmother passed, I started saving everything she had ever given me. I was afraid that I would forget her and the time we had together. By saving everything from hoodies that no longer fit me to a broken jewelry box, I thought that it would make me feel closer to her. My room was filled with things she had given me.\\n\\nWhen I was in my senior year of high school, I stopped caring about literally everything. I never told anybody about what was happening in my personal life or at school and often came home, slept until eight or nine, woke up to eat, and went back to sleep. I would take food to my bedroom and eat there and would leave stacks of paper plates, silverware, and cups in my room.\\n\\nI went to college for a year but never made any friends. I was always very shy and, after my high school experience, I was afraid to meet new people. It seems silly, but I had honestly branded myself as someone who is just unlikeable and I avoided social interaction. I dropped out after my first year of college and moved back home to my still messy room. I eventually stopped caring about what I looked like and gained about forty pounds.\\n\\nAfter I dropped out, I got a job and turned to online shopping to make myself feel somewhat better. Buying myself something nice made me feel good...until the novelty of whatever I bought wore off and I searched for a new item to buy. I was ashamed of how much I was shopping and hid the boxes in my bedroom so nobody would see them.\\n\\nI would like to mention that I hated my job and, despite my efforts, still had not made any friends. As of now, I am 23 and my only friends are my parents, my siblings, and sometimes my boyfriend.\\n\\nWhen I was laid off, I was kind of relieved. I didn’t have to go to a place I hated anymore. I didn’t have to deal with rude customers. I didn’t have to deal with coworkers that didn’t like me. I didn’t have to deal with anything at all. I had time to sit and read a book, go for walks, and just relax. I was still babysitting my younger brother, but I had time to do things for myself that didn’t involve eating or online shopping.\\n\\nI was offered a new bedroom suite by a relative for a pretty low price around the time I was laid off. It was in really good condition and I had been looking to replace my old items anyway. I had two days to pick up the items and write a check. Which also meant that I had two days to clean my bedroom.\\n\\nWith my mom’s help, some rubber gloves, and a lot of trash bags, I managed to get rid of all the garbage in my room in about a week. My dad let me store the new items in our sunroom until I had the room clean.\\n\\nI didn’t think to count, but I used about fifteen 45-gallon trash bags and about five 13-gallon trash bags. I took about forty boxes and a 45-gallon bag of bottles to the recycling center. I got rid of fifteen pairs of shoes I no longer wore and nearly halved the amount of clothing I had.\\n\\nI still have some things I need to get rid of. I still have a little bit of trash in my room, but nothing that warrants a huge garbage bag. I still have things on my floor and things that need homes. I still have some boxes that need broken down and recycled. And I still have a bag of stuffed animals I don’t know what to do with.\\n\\nBut, for the first time, I feel in control and I love it. I have cleaned most of my room, have lost almost twenty pounds so far, and am looking into a career change that I am very excited about. I’ve also seen my doctor and was prescribed medication for anxiety and major depression and am feeling very optimistic about life.\\n\\nI don’t think I would feel the same way I do now if I had never cleaned my bedroom.</td>\n",

All of the trash, separated the valuables mixed in, got together the laundry, bathroom, kitchen, refrigerator. He was here for almost 6 hours. Obviously gave him a big tip and I’m so relieved. Worth the money and now I just need to hit the laundry mat and use this as a fresh start. Thanks for the support everyone I was up all night ready to cancel. If anyone’s looking for help, I used the neighborhood app and got a lot of responses. Many of your comments made me feel much more comfortable so thanks. 🙏 \\n\\n\\nI’m a grown man in my late Twenties. I suffered a very tragic loss, and in less than a year have neglected the heck out of my apartment through depression and alcoholism, to the point where I just now seeing how bad it is. Trash everywhere. Bathroom disgusting. Kitchen disgusting. Laundry everywhere. I hired someone to come clean it today but I feel like canceling, I sent some pictures but I’m worried it’s worse in person. Idk what to do.

       "      <td>I have been hoarding for the last 10 years and it got really bad during the pandemic as my depression has worsened and worsened. I am trying to get motivated and have been seeing a therapist. I am so desperately trying. I often find myself leaving the house just because I get so overwhelmed as to where to start. My mother recently suggested that she help me clean, but it's because of our traumatic relationship that this even started. As a child, she threw away prized possessions because she felt I no longer needed them. After that, I refused to let her throw anything of mine away. I can still remember how distraught I felt at what felt like an invasion of privacy and disrespect. \\n\\nI am now in a place where I just want to get rid of it all and just start my life over, but because of the shame and embarrassment, I am having a hard time figuring out where to start. Like, if someone came to my house and got rid of it all, I'd be okay with it. I supposed the actual mental labor is what is stopping me in my tracks. I'm not sure what I am even asking at this point.

       "      <td>Thank you to everyone that responded to my first post and my apologies for not responding to everyone. \\n\\nI have been going through my hoarded items but it has been a slow process as I have been making sure to fully understand my thoughts about items before parting ways with them. Seeing my boyfriend is top of my priority list but I know that resolving my hoarding is super important too. I am hoping that if I can understand my feelings while dealing with the stuff now then I won't ever have to do another 'big clearout' again!\\n\\nI have been able to sort through a lot of stuff, and get rid of a lot of things that I previously never thought I could! \\n\\nMost of my hoard is sanitary things I have 'saved' but has no value. I had 'saved' many rejected books that donation shops had been sent but couldn't sell on due to the books being in poor condition or being written in. I couldn't stand the idea of the books being thrown away back then but recently I was able to take the books to a paper recycling centre so they can be reused as different paper products. I was still sad to see the books go but having the space to spend time with my boyfriend is much more important to me than the objects. \\n\\nMy boyfriend hasn't come back to the house yet, partly because I haven't finished sorting and partly because he is doing his usual schedule of seasonal work before the Christmas cutoff. \\n\\nI still have a lot to go through but I have never had so much floor space or the piles of boxes be so low! My goal is to have everything clean for Christmas if I can. \\n\\nI haven't heard anything back about seeing a mental health professional just yet however I have to wait for them to contact me. \\n\\nThank you for all of the kind words and support from my last post and also all of of the extremely useful resources and perspectives. They have been so helpful with changing how I viewed my relationship with things.\\n\\nTL:DR I am still with my boyfriend and still sorting my hoard but I have parted ways with lots of stuff.\\n\\nThank you such much for the Silver Award, that is so generous!</td>\n",

Hoarding disorders might be empathy on too high of a level, to the point you feel bad for even throwing out paper. To extreme empaths like this, everything is alive, they affect everything in some way, and throwing them out is like leaving your loved ones in prison to rot. Objects have more life than humans, even. Objects don’t commit murder, or rob innocent people. So what did they ever do to be thrown out? They are at our mercy. It’s our choice. Those who ponder over it too much get called hoarders.   \n",

When a person loses someone that they were very close to, a parent, spouse or a child, they try to fill that ache in their heart with stuff. Stress can also. Of course there are some mental health diagnosis that can include hoarding symptoms too. Paranoid Schizophrenia for one. Depression and anxiety disorder as well as ADHD can have symptoms of hoarding behavior. A person’s environment and what was going on in life need to be factored in. If a person grew up in a hoarding environment they are more likely to hoard. I know people who were discharged from institutions to community living often hoarded socks and snacks in their pillow cases. In the institutions everything was shared so this is the first time people had their own belongings. Probably more of a hide than a hoard. Also, people who grew up in war times or during the depression had the tendency to hoard. Probably to not waste and to make sure they had things when they needed them. Hoarding disorder is not an old diagnosis so many people back in those days were not aware they had a hoarding disorder.   \n",

What causes any mental illness? Sometimes a cause can be found - such as with PTSD, which happens after a person suffers a very traumatic event. Other times a person is simply born with a brain that doesn’t function properly - and I don’t mean that in a cruel way. People born with diabetes have a pancreas that doesn’t function properly, some mental illnesses are just the same, only with the brain. Sometimes it’s a combination - a person might have Obsessive/Compulsive tendencies and then they experience something traumatic, such as losing a child or a divorce, and the tendencies become a full-blown mental illness.\\nI don’t think there is any way to prevent hoarding, any more than there is a way to prevent other types of OCD. The TREATMENT for hoarding is very, very difficult because the person needs to WANT to stop hoarding, and most hoarders simply do not see the harm in what they are doing, so they don’t want to stop.\\nThe families and friends of hoarders tend to feel that the hoarder is choosing their ‘junk’ over their loved ones. The hoarders just don’t see it that way - they can’t, they are sick. Hoarding is tragic and extremely damaging to everyone involved and so far there is no really good treatment unless the hoarder WANTS to change, and even then, it’s very hard.   \n",

Failure to move on, can be reflected by a failure to move things on, and things lost can be over-compensated for by things found and gathered. The paralysis of depression can lead to a mental log jamb which is then replicated in the physical surroundings. The effect of so much clutter and junk, or stuff, can be to create a defensive wall against the outside world.\\nSo usually the hoarding is a neurotic compulsion, triggered by trauma, as an aberrant defence mechanism, but it soon becomes a reward punishment cycle which feeds in on itself, becoming a trauma in and of itself.\\nNeediness comes to mind, where the need is not met, so the stuff becomes the next best available option, albeit a dysfunctional option. Similar to an addiction.   \n",

       "4040  Back in March, I had posted about some progress I had made with my bedroom. I have made a little more progress in the last two months, so I figured I would share again. I haven’t completely finished cleaning and still need to organize some things and get rid of some things, but I’m somewhat content with the current state of the room.\\n\\n[Progress pics](https://imgur.com/a/OhHaIT1)\\n\\nA little background on and things I have discovered about myself for anyone who is interested:\\n\\nI was, like many people, laid off in March and, honestly, this has been the first time in my life where I have felt in control about myself and my life.\\n\\nWhen I was young (ages 5-11), I was sexually abused by my great-uncle, who lived with my grandmother. I didn’t understand what was happening until I was about eight or nine and, by then, my grandmother was very sick and I was afraid that, if I said anything, I would never get to go to her house again. I went to her house every day after school and every weekday during the summer and she was and always will be my favorite person in the world. She passed away when I was 11 and, when I started middle school the next year, my parents decided that I was old enough to stay home alone after school. My great-uncle passed away a few years later and this is the first time I have ever mentioned the abuse to anybody.\\n\\nWhen I was in high school, I was in a bad relationship with somebody that assaulted me. When he broke up with me, he told our mutual friends (which was the vast majority of my friends) that I was crazy and a slut and I graduated high school with no friends. One of his friends constantly harassed and poked fun at me for nearly everything I did and another told me that he could rape me and throw my body in a river and nobody would care. High school was great.\\n\\nAfter my grandmother passed, I started saving everything she had ever given me. I was afraid that I would forget her and the time we had together. By saving everything from hoodies that no longer fit me to a broken jewelry box, I thought that it would make me feel closer to her. My room was filled with things she had given me.\\n\\nWhen I was in my senior year of high school, I stopped caring about literally everything. I never told anybody about what was happening in my personal life or at school and often came home, slept until eight or nine, woke up to eat, and went back to sleep. I would take food to my bedroom and eat there and would leave stacks of paper plates, silverware, and cups in my room.\\n\\nI went to college for a year but never made any friends. I was always very shy and, after my high school experience, I was afraid to meet new people. It seems silly, but I had honestly branded myself as someone who is just unlikeable and I avoided social interaction. I dropped out after my first year of college and moved back home to my still messy room. I eventually stopped caring about what I looked like and gained about forty pounds.\\n\\nAfter I dropped out, I got a job and turned to online shopping to make myself feel somewhat better. Buying myself something nice made me feel good...until the novelty of whatever I bought wore off and I searched for a new item to buy. I was ashamed of how much I was shopping and hid the boxes in my bedroom so nobody would see them.\\n\\nI would like to mention that I hated my job and, despite my efforts, still had not made any friends. As of now, I am 23 and my only friends are my parents, my siblings, and sometimes my boyfriend.\\n\\nWhen I was laid off, I was kind of relieved. I didn’t have to go to a place I hated anymore. I didn’t have to deal with rude customers. I didn’t have to deal with coworkers that didn’t like me. I didn’t have to deal with anything at all. I had time to sit and read a book, go for walks, and just relax. I was still babysitting my younger brother, but I had time to do things for myself that didn’t involve eating or online shopping.\\n\\nI was offered a new bedroom suite by a relative for a pretty low price around the time I was laid off. It was in really good condition and I had been looking to replace my old items anyway. I had two days to pick up the items and write a check. Which also meant that I had two days to clean my bedroom.\\n\\nWith my mom’s help, some rubber gloves, and a lot of trash bags, I managed to get rid of all the garbage in my room in about a week. My dad let me store the new items in our sunroom until I had the room clean.\\n\\nI didn’t think to count, but I used about fifteen 45-gallon trash bags and about five 13-gallon trash bags. I took about forty boxes and a 45-gallon bag of bottles to the recycling center. I got rid of fifteen pairs of shoes I no longer wore and nearly halved the amount of clothing I had.\\n\\nI still have some things I need to get rid of. I still have a little bit of trash in my room, but nothing that warrants a huge garbage bag. I still have things on my floor and things that need homes. I still have some boxes that need broken down and recycled. And I still have a bag of stuffed animals I don’t know what to do with.\\n\\nBut, for the first time, I feel in control and I love it. I have cleaned most of my room, have lost almost twenty pounds so far, and am looking into a career change that I am very excited about. I’ve also seen my doctor and was prescribed medication for anxiety and major depression and am feeling very optimistic about life.\\n\\nI don’t think I would feel the same way I do now if I had never cleaned my bedroom.   \n",

Man I was nervous, but he got right to it and took care of all my major problems. All of the trash, separated the valuables mixed in, got together the laundry, bathroom, kitchen, refrigerator. He was here for almost 6 hours. Obviously gave him a big tip and I’m so relieved. Worth the money and now I just need to hit the laundry mat and use this as a fresh start. Thanks for the support everyone I was up all night ready to cancel. If anyone’s looking for help, I used the neighborhood app and got a lot of responses. Many of your comments made me feel much more comfortable so thanks. 🙏 \\n\\n\\nI’m a grown man in my late Twenties. I suffered a very tragic loss, and in less than a year have neglected the heck out of my apartment through depression and alcoholism, to the point where I just now seeing how bad it is. Trash everywhere. Bathroom disgusting. Kitchen disgusting. Laundry everywhere. I hired someone to come clean it today but I feel like canceling, I sent some pictures but I’m worried it’s worse in person. Idk what to do. The pain of living in this filth has been a distraction of the pain of the loss. I needed to vent.   \n",

I am trying to get motivated and have been seeing a therapist. I am so desperately trying. I often find myself leaving the house just because I get so overwhelmed as to where to start. My mother recently suggested that she help me clean, but it's because of our traumatic relationship that this even started. As a child, she threw away prized possessions because she felt I no longer needed them. After that, I refused to let her throw anything of mine away. I can still remember how distraught I felt at what felt like an invasion of privacy and disrespect. \\n\\nI am now in a place where I just want to get rid of it all and just start my life over, but because of the shame and embarrassment, I am having a hard time figuring out where to start. Like, if someone came to my house and got rid of it all, I'd be okay with it. I supposed the actual mental labor is what is stopping me in my tracks. I'm not sure what I am even asking at this point. This all just makes me so sad.   \n",

Seeing my boyfriend is top of my priority list but I know that resolving my hoarding is super important too. I am hoping that if I can understand my feelings while dealing with the stuff now then I won't ever have to do another 'big clearout' again!\\n\\nI have been able to sort through a lot of stuff, and get rid of a lot of things that I previously never thought I could! \\n\\nMost of my hoard is sanitary things I have 'saved' but has no value. I had 'saved' many rejected books that donation shops had been sent but couldn't sell on due to the books being in poor condition or being written in. I couldn't stand the idea of the books being thrown away back then but recently I was able to take the books to a paper recycling centre so they can be reused as different paper products. I was still sad to see the books go but having the space to spend time with my boyfriend is much more important to me than the objects. \\n\\nMy boyfriend hasn't come back to the house yet, partly because I haven't finished sorting and partly because he is doing his usual schedule of seasonal work before the Christmas cutoff. \\n\\nI still have a lot to go through but I have never had so much floor space or the piles of boxes be so low! My goal is to have everything clean for Christmas if I can. \\n\\nI haven't heard anything back about seeing a mental health professional just yet however I have to wait for them to contact me. \\n\\nThank you for all of the kind words and support from my last post and also all of of the extremely useful resources and perspectives. They have been so helpful with changing how I viewed my relationship with things.\\n\\nTL:DR I am still with my boyfriend and still sorting my hoard but I have parted ways with lots of stuff.\\n\\nThank you such much for the Silver Award, that is so generous!   \n",

       "      <td>Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)\\nThere are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.\\nNow, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.\\nThe day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.\\nHow did this change the path of my life?\\nAs I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Not really. OCD in itself isn't dangerous. But it can lead to destructive behaviors.\\nI am an OCD psychologist (at Mantra Care), and I've seen firsthand how OCD can manifest in various ways.\\nFor instance, I once had a client with severe contamination fears. He was constantly worried about germs and spent hours each day cleaning. Initially, this might not sound dangerous, but it significantly disrupted his life.\\nHe started avoiding public places, even missing out on important family events. It got to the point where he began using harsh chemicals to clean his skin, resulting in severe rashes and infections.\\nThe real danger with OCD is when the compulsions take over, leading to physical harm or impairing one's ability to function daily.\\nMy client's case is an example of how OCD, while not directly dangerous, can push individuals into harmful behaviors if not managed properly.\\nTo help Sarah, I used cognitive-behavioral therapy, specifically Exposure and Response Prevention. And over time, my client learned to tolerate the anxiety and realized that their fears were unreasonable.\\nSo OCD is not life-threatening but it can lead to severe behaviors which can be treated through therapy.\\nIf you or someone you know is facing similar issues, you can contact me or other psychologists on Mantra Care. We’ll be happy to help.</td>\n",

       "      <td>There are different type of OCDs. OCDs are mostly non-lethal, but can really ruin a person's life in other aspects.\\nTypically a person’s OCD will fall into one of the following four areas.\\n* Checking: the need to check is the compulsion, the obsessive fear might be to prevent damage, fire, leaks or harm\\n* Contamination / Mental Contamination: the need to clean and wash is the compulsion, the obsessive fear is that something is contaminated and/or may cause illness, and ultimately death, to a loved one or oneself.\\n* Hoarding: Another obsession long considered to be part of ‘OCD’ is the inability to discard useless or worn out possessions, commonly referred to as ‘hoarding’.\\n* Ruminations / Intrusive Thoughts: 'Rumination' is a term often used to describe all obsessional intrusive thoughts, but this is misleading. In the context of OCD a rumination is actually a train of prolonged thinking about a question or theme that is undirected and unproductive. Unlike obsessional thoughts, ruminations are not objectionable and are indulged rather than resisted. Many ruminations dwell on religious, philosophical, or metaphysical topics, such as the origins of the universe, life after death, the nature of morality, and so on.\\nInteresting fact is that a lot of big names(David Beckham...\\nAccess this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriber\\nAccess all answers reserved by\\nSunny Jaiswal\\nfor Quora+ subscribers\\nAccess exclusive answers from thousands more participating creators in Quora+\\nBrowse ad‑free and support creators\\nStart free trial\\nLearn more</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ve been thinking about this a lot in light of people diagnosing themselves with ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID based on TikTok content. As someone with what a psychiatrist called “the most clear cut case of ADHD I’ve ever seen”, it annoys me to see all these cute videos about quirky traits being attributed to ADHD. People without ADHD see these and think “I do this so maybe I have it!” and they completely gloss over the debilitating nature of living with ADHD.\\n\\nI’m glad OCD hasn’t gotten the same cutesy spin as other mental illnesses, but it got me wondering why that is. And I think it’s because, with the ego-dystonic and logic-defying nature of this  illness, there’s really nothing relatable about it if you don’t have it. While some traits of ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID can be relatable to a broader audience, nothing about being worried you’re a pedophile, or being terrified you’ll cheat on your partner when you have no intention to, or having intrusive thoughts about harming others is something people can relate to if they don’t experience it. Nor would they want to. \\n\\nIt can feel really lonely at times because very few people understand, but it also means there aren’t a wave of self-diagnosed-from-TikTok folks clogging up access to services, so I see it as a good thing. \\n\\nThoughts?</td>\n",

       "2     Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)\\nThere are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.\\nNow, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.\\nThe day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center.

So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.\\nHow did this change the path of my life?\\nAs I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.   \n",

OCD in itself isn't dangerous. But it can lead to destructive behaviors.\\nI am an OCD psychologist (at Mantra Care), and I've seen firsthand how OCD can manifest in various ways.\\nFor instance, I once had a client with severe contamination fears. He was constantly worried about germs and spent hours each day cleaning. Initially, this might not sound dangerous, but it significantly disrupted his life.\\nHe started avoiding public places, even missing out on important family events. It got to the point where he began using harsh chemicals to clean his skin, resulting in severe rashes and infections.\\nThe real danger with OCD is when the compulsions take over, leading to physical harm or impairing one's ability to function daily.\\nMy client's case is an example of how OCD, while not directly dangerous, can push individuals into harmful behaviors if not managed properly.\\nTo help Sarah, I used cognitive-behavioral therapy, specifically Exposure and Response Prevention. And over time, my client learned to tolerate the anxiety and realized that their fears were unreasonable.\\nSo OCD is not life-threatening but it can lead to severe behaviors which can be treated through therapy.\\nIf you or someone you know is facing similar issues, you can contact me or other psychologists on Mantra Care. We’ll be happy to help.   \n",

OCDs are mostly non-lethal, but can really ruin a person's life in other aspects.\\nTypically a person’s OCD will fall into one of the following four areas.\\n* Checking: the need to check is the compulsion, the obsessive fear might be to prevent damage, fire, leaks or harm\\n* Contamination / Mental Contamination: the need to clean and wash is the compulsion, the obsessive fear is that something is contaminated and/or may cause illness, and ultimately death, to a loved one or oneself.\\n* Hoarding: Another obsession long considered to be part of ‘OCD’ is the inability to discard useless or worn out possessions, commonly referred to as ‘hoarding’.\\n* Ruminations / Intrusive Thoughts: 'Rumination' is a term often used to describe all obsessional intrusive thoughts, but this is misleading. In the context of OCD a rumination is actually a train of prolonged thinking about a question or theme that is undirected and unproductive. Unlike obsessional thoughts, ruminations are not objectionable and are indulged rather than resisted. Many ruminations dwell on religious, philosophical, or metaphysical topics, such as the origins of the universe, life after death, the nature of morality, and so on.\\nInteresting fact is that a lot of big names(David Beckham...\\nAccess this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriber\\nAccess all answers reserved by\\nSunny Jaiswal\\nfor Quora+ subscribers\\nAccess exclusive answers from thousands more participating creators in Quora+\\nBrowse ad‑free and support creators\\nStart free trial\\nLearn more   \n",

As someone with what a psychiatrist called “the most clear cut case of ADHD I’ve ever seen”, it annoys me to see all these cute videos about quirky traits being attributed to ADHD. People without ADHD see these and think “I do this so maybe I have it!” and they completely gloss over the debilitating nature of living with ADHD.\\n\\nI’m glad OCD hasn’t gotten the same cutesy spin as other mental illnesses, but it got me wondering why that is. And I think it’s because, with the ego-dystonic and logic-defying nature of this  illness, there’s really nothing relatable about it if you don’t have it. While some traits of ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID can be relatable to a broader audience, nothing about being worried you’re a pedophile, or being terrified you’ll cheat on your partner when you have no intention to, or having intrusive thoughts about harming others is something people can relate to if they don’t experience it. Nor would they want to. \\n\\nIt can feel really lonely at times because very few people understand, but it also means there aren’t a wave of self-diagnosed-from-TikTok folks clogging up access to services, so I see it as a good thing. \\n\\nThoughts?   \n",

All the lines in the floor, cracks in the concrete, shadows and imaginary lines. I felt like a kid and almost cried.\\n\\nI feel like a huge weight had been lifted off of me.

If you felt vulnerable during childhood, not safe, your brain is trained to see dangers everywhere. So, it becomes trained to react with anxiety to many situations. Physical abuse, bulling, and many others can create the basis for an anxiety disorder later in life. For adults, stressful situations over a long period of time can create the basis for a panic disorder. Uncertainties about the future, sickness, a divorce, unemployment with children and so forth.\\nPsychiatrists say that anxiety disorders are created by an imbalance of brain chemicals, so they prescribe pills to correct those imbalances. I firmly believe that it’s not like that. To me, anxiety create those chemical imbalances, not the other way around, and pills don’t resolve anything, just mask the symptons. When you drop the pills the anxiety comes back recharged. You need to discover the root of your anxiety and work these roots, pills don’t led to self discovery. Once you work on the root of your anxiety and get control over it, your brain chemicals balance themselves as you reprogram your brain.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Based on having worked with over 10,000 panic sufferers, I completely agree with Jose.\\nWe all have anxiety-producing thoughts. We all get into anxiety-producing situations. Why do some of us suffer from anxiety and panic and some of us don't?\\nThe difference is how arousal is UNCONSCIOUSLY regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).\\nFollowing the release of stress hormones caused by a thought or an event\\n(a.) a person whose (PNS) is doing its job gets revved up, but their PNS steps in and calms them so quickly that this reaction to the release of stress hormones doesn’t register as anxiety.\\n(b.), a person whose PNS doesn't kick in gets revved up and stays revved up. The physical feelings that results (increase in heart rate, breathing rate, perspiration, and tension) are associated with danger. The feeling that there is danger leads the person to believe the bad thing they are thinking about is going to happen.\\nThe answer is not to avoid thoughts. There is no healthy way to do that.\\nThe answer is not to think positive thoughts. Positive thoughts do not activate your PNS. An inactive PNS cannot calm you.\\nThe answer is not breathing exercises. They are only a temporary distraction.\\nThe answer is to change your unconscious processing. You can train your PNS to activate and calm you based on the relationship you have with a friend who is safe to be with physically and emotionally, someone you are sure will not hurt you physically and who does not judge you. Such a person sends unconscious signals that activate your PNS.\\nAnxiety is controlled by linking the memory of that person’s face, voice quality, and touch to two things: to the feelings that take place when stress hormones are released, and (b.) to each “what if” thought, Your PNS will be activated by the feelings and the thoughts, and can calm you down.\\nThis method has a deeper benefit. As you become able to allow thoughts to come to mind, and even to remain in the mind without causing distress, you are better able to deal with problems rather than avoid them and not reach no solution.\\nTo Understand Regulation, Consider Your Car\\nYour car has an accelerator pedal. When pressed, it sends gas into the engine to rev it up. The accelerator pedal is like the amygdala. When triggered, the amygdala releases stress hormones that cause the sympathetic system to rev us up.Your car also has a brake pedal. When pressed, it slows the car down. The parasympathetic system acts as a brake. When activated, it overrides the sympathetic system and slows the brain and body down.\\nA driver ordinarily presses only one pedal at a time. But in the brain can—and often should—operate the accelerator and the brake at the same time. Why? Because the brain's gas pedal has a lag. Once stress hormones are released, they continue revving the person up until they “burn off.” It's like your car continuing to accelerate after you have taken your foot off the accelerator pedal.\\nThat's a frightening prospect. If the brakes aren't good, it's terrifying. That's what panic is all about. When panic takes place, it is not our revving up a system that's at fault. It is working just as it is supposed to. The problem is our emotional braking system. The system that is supposed to calm us down isn't working. Instead of fixing the faulty brakes, CBT tries to fix what isn't broken.When a thought about something dangerous enters the mind, the amygdala does not recognize it as just a thought. In a “knee-jerk” reaction to the image of danger, the amygdala releases stress hormones. The hormones cause the sympathetic nervous system to rev the person up. That's the \"fight or flight\" response.\\nThe same stress hormones activate our high-level thinking (executive function). Stress hormones are its cue to figure out what the amygdala is reacting to, determine whether it is or is not a threat, and decide what—if anything—needs to be done. But if stress hormones rise too high, Executive Function gets overwhelmed.\\nThe Parasympathetic Nervous System to the Rescue\\nA series of thoughts about danger can trigger one release of stress hormones after another. If stress hormones levels rise too high, Executive Function shuts down unless the stress hormone effects are counteracted by parasympathetic system activity. In your car, the brake pedal can override the accelerator pedal.\\nFor example, if you plant your left foot solidly on the brake, even if you press on the gas pedal with your right foot, the car goes nowhere. In a car, the brake pedal can override the gas pedal. The same is true in the mind when the parasympathetic nervous system is fully activated.\\nLet's look at what happens if the parasympathetic nervous system doesn't step in and protect the Executive Function from excessive stress hormones.\\nScenario One: The amygdala reacts to an actual threat. The parasympathetic nervous system does not step in. Fully overwhelmed, the executive function cannot deal with the threat rationally for a few minutes. Without the protection of the parasympathetic nervous system, the person is at risk until the stress hormones burn off.\\nScenario Two: The amygdala reacts to an imagined threat. The parasympathetic nervous system does not neutralize the effects of the stress hormones. Partially overwhelmed, executive function is unable to recognize that the threat is not real. Feelings caused by up-regulation (rapid heart rate, breathing rate, tension, etc.) are associated with danger, more in some persons than in others depending upon previous experience. These feelings mislead the person to believe danger exists. With executive function disabled by stress hormones, the person cannot decide what to do. The person stays anxious, or worse, goes into a panic.\\nWithout the protection of the parasympathetic nervous system, rational thinking—exactly what CBT depends on—may be impossible. Attempting to reverse hyper-arousal with reason alone is like trying to lift yourself by your bootstraps.Though the parasympathetic nervous system exists at birth, an infant cannot self-activate it. For down-regulation to occur, a caregiver must activate the infant’s parasympathetic nervous system. Research by Stephen Porges finds it is activated by social engagement.When we are with other people, we unconsciously send and receive signals. These signals are unconsciously processed. If the caregiver's signals are calm and benign, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated by\\nThe caregiver's soft, non-judgmental facial expression.\\nThe quality of the caregiver's voice\\nThe caregiver's touch\\nIf a child’s parasympathetic nervous system is activated consistently enough in response to the release of stress hormones, the child’s parasympathetic nervous system becomes programmed to self-activate when stress hormones are released.Unfortunately, insecurely attached children, believed to be approximately 40 percent, are unlikely to develop programming that activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to stress hormone release. Recent research indicates that if a caregiver yells at a child or otherwise frightens the child during formative years the child will not develop secure attachment, and the programming that is supposed to be developed may not develop.Anxiety is not well-regulated, and as an adult, the person may develop a generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.\\nBottom Line\\nIf stress hormones get a head start, rational thinking shuts down. The answer is to program the parasympathetic nervous system to step in when needed.

       "      <td>Causes of panic disorder\\nPanic disorders are caused by an imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain that regulate anxiety and stress. The neurotransmitter most commonly associated with panic attacks is GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for regulating relaxation.\\nWhen GABA levels are low, your brain will produce excess adrenaline, also known as the “fight or flight” hormone, which is responsible for your feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic. GABA is a naturally occurring brain chemical that is responsible for regulating relaxation. It is also the brain’s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning that it acts as a sort of “brake” to balance out the excitatory neurotransmitters.\\nWhen GABA levels are low, your brain will produce excess adrenaline, also known as the “fight or flight” hormone, which is responsible for your feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic.\\nOriental Therapy For Panic Disorder\\nPlease attach 6 grains of millet or raw rice cut in a half to both hands with medical tapes as shown in the following pictures.

       "      <td>Two things; learned helplessness and a high level of the stress hormone cortisol. Learned helplessness is a psychological state in which the subject (ranging from rats to humanity) is unable to avoid a stressor. After being in this condition, when they are free to take action the being simply feels great fear and cannot act. With me it was school; I was depressed and only sedation allowed me to stay in my seat.\\nThe other major influence is hormonal. Researchers have found that people with anxiety disorders tend to have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This is particularly marked in people with social anxiety disorder.

Anything to keep your body moving will allow it to do it's thing and move out of the mode.\\n\\n4. TALK TO YOURSELF. I can't stress this enough. When my heart is racing 1,000 miles an hour and I feel dizzy, I start talking to myself. Verbally describe your surroundings, plans for the day, or things you see out loud. Ex: \"I'm gonna make a sandwich, drink some water, the dog is taking a nice nap and sleeping on the floor, tomorrow I'm going to ____\" it sounds crazy, but it helps.\\n\\n5.

Pat on your legs, one after the other at a medium rate.



                                                                                                                                                                                 Many people say genetics or traumatic experiences. My theory comes from the latter. To me, it’s a wrong programming of the brain, which can be reversed, by treatment that helps create new neural pathways. If you felt vulnerable during childhood, not safe, your brain is trained to see dangers everywhere. So, it becomes trained to react with anxiety to many situations. Physical abuse, bulling, and many others can create the basis for an anxiety disorder later in life. For adults, stressful situations over a long period of time can create the basis for a panic disorder. Uncertainties about the future, sickness, a divorce, unemployment with children and so forth.\\nPsychiatrists say that anxiety disorders are created by an imbalance of brain chemicals, so they prescribe pills to correct those imbalances. I firmly believe that it’s not like that. To me, anxiety create those chemical imbalances, not the other way around, and pills don’t resolve anything, just mask the symptons. When you drop the pills the anxiety comes back recharged. You need to discover the root of your anxiety and work these roots, pills don’t led to self discovery. Once you work on the root of your anxiety and get control over it, your brain chemicals balance themselves as you reprogram your brain.   \n",
       "1     Based on having worked with over 10,000 panic sufferers, I completely agree with Jose.\\nWe all have anxiety-producing thoughts. We all get into anxiety-producing situations. Why do some of us suffer from anxiety and panic and some of us don't?\\nThe difference is how arousal is UNCONSCIOUSLY regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS).\\nFollowing the release of stress hormones caused by a thought or an event\\n(a.) a person whose (PNS) is doing its job gets revved up, but their PNS steps in and calms them so quickly that this reaction to the release of stress hormones doesn’t register as anxiety.\\n(b.), a person whose PNS doesn't kick in gets revved up and stays revved up. The physical feelings that results (increase in heart rate, breathing rate, perspiration, and tension) are associated with danger. The feeling that there is danger leads the person to believe the bad thing they are thinking about is going to happen.\\nThe answer is not to avoid thoughts. There is no healthy way to do that.\\nThe answer is not to think positive thoughts. Positive thoughts do not activate your PNS. An inactive PNS cannot calm you.\\nThe answer is not breathing exercises. They are only a temporary distraction.\\nThe answer is to change your unconscious processing. You can train your PNS to activate and calm you based on the relationship you have with a friend who is safe to be with physically and emotionally, someone you are sure will not hurt you physically and who does not judge you. Such a person sends unconscious signals that activate your PNS.\\nAnxiety is controlled by linking the memory of that person’s face, voice quality, and touch to two things: to the feelings that take place when stress hormones are released, and (b.) to each “what if” thought, Your PNS will be activated by the feelings and the thoughts, and can calm you down.\\nThis method has a deeper benefit. As you become able to allow thoughts to come to mind, and even to remain in the mind without causing distress, you are better able to deal with problems rather than avoid them and not reach no solution.\\nTo Understand Regulation, Consider Your Car\\nYour car has an accelerator pedal. When pressed, it sends gas into the engine to rev it up. The accelerator pedal is like the amygdala. When triggered, the amygdala releases stress hormones that cause the sympathetic system to rev us up.Your car also has a brake pedal. When pressed, it slows the car down. The parasympathetic system acts as a brake. When activated, it overrides the sympathetic system and slows the brain and body down.\\nA driver ordinarily presses only one pedal at a time. But in the brain can—and often should—operate the accelerator and the brake at the same time. Why? Because the brain's gas pedal has a lag. Once stress hormones are released, they continue revving the person up until they “burn off.” It's like your car continuing to accelerate after you have taken your foot off the accelerator pedal.\\nThat's a frightening prospect. If the brakes aren't good, it's terrifying. That's what panic is all about. When panic takes place, it is not our revving up a system that's at fault. It is working just as it is supposed to. The problem is our emotional braking system. The system that is supposed to calm us down isn't working. Instead of fixing the faulty brakes, CBT tries to fix what isn't broken.When a thought about something dangerous enters the mind, the amygdala does not recognize it as just a thought. In a “knee-jerk” reaction to the image of danger, the amygdala releases stress hormones. The hormones cause the sympathetic nervous system to rev the person up. That's the \"fight or flight\" response.\\nThe same stress hormones activate our high-level thinking (executive function). Stress hormones are its cue to figure out what the amygdala is reacting to, determine whether it is or is not a threat, and decide what—if anything—needs to be done. But if stress hormones rise too high, Executive Function gets overwhelmed.\\nThe Parasympathetic Nervous System to the Rescue\\nA series of thoughts about danger can trigger one release of stress hormones after another. If stress hormones levels rise too high, Executive Function shuts down unless the stress hormone effects are counteracted by parasympathetic system activity. In your car, the brake pedal can override the accelerator pedal.\\nFor example, if you plant your left foot solidly on the brake, even if you press on the gas pedal with your right foot, the car goes nowhere. In a car, the brake pedal can override the gas pedal. The same is true in the mind when the parasympathetic nervous system is fully activated.\\nLet's look at what happens if the parasympathetic nervous system doesn't step in and protect the Executive Function from excessive stress hormones.\\nScenario One: The amygdala reacts to an actual threat. The parasympathetic nervous system does not step in. Fully overwhelmed, the executive function cannot deal with the threat rationally for a few minutes. Without the protection of the parasympathetic nervous system, the person is at risk until the stress hormones burn off.\\nScenario Two: The amygdala reacts to an imagined threat. The parasympathetic nervous system does not neutralize the effects of the stress hormones. Partially overwhelmed, executive function is unable to recognize that the threat is not real. Feelings caused by up-regulation (rapid heart rate, breathing rate, tension, etc.) are associated with danger, more in some persons than in others depending upon previous experience. These feelings mislead the person to believe danger exists. With executive function disabled by stress hormones, the person cannot decide what to do. The person stays anxious, or worse, goes into a panic.\\nWithout the protection of the parasympathetic nervous system, rational thinking—exactly what CBT depends on—may be impossible. Attempting to reverse hyper-arousal with reason alone is like trying to lift yourself by your bootstraps.Though the parasympathetic nervous system exists at birth, an infant cannot self-activate it. For down-regulation to occur, a caregiver must activate the infant’s parasympathetic nervous system. Research by Stephen Porges finds it is activated by social engagement.When we are with other people, we unconsciously send and receive signals. These signals are unconsciously processed. If the caregiver's signals are calm and benign, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated by\\nThe caregiver's soft, non-judgmental facial expression.\\nThe quality of the caregiver's voice\\nThe caregiver's touch\\nIf a child’s parasympathetic nervous system is activated consistently enough in response to the release of stress hormones, the child’s parasympathetic nervous system becomes programmed to self-activate when stress hormones are released.Unfortunately, insecurely attached children, believed to be approximately 40 percent, are unlikely to develop programming that activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to stress hormone release. Recent research indicates that if a caregiver yells at a child or otherwise frightens the child during formative years the child will not develop secure attachment, and the programming that is supposed to be developed may not develop.Anxiety is not well-regulated, and as an adult, the person may develop a generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder.\\nBottom Line\\nIf stress hormones get a head start, rational thinking shuts down. The answer is to program the parasympathetic nervous system to step in when needed.

                                                  Causes of panic disorder\\nPanic disorders are caused by an imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain that regulate anxiety and stress. The neurotransmitter most commonly associated with panic attacks is GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). GABA is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for regulating relaxation.\\nWhen GABA levels are low, your brain will produce excess adrenaline, also known as the “fight or flight” hormone, which is responsible for your feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic. GABA is a naturally occurring brain chemical that is responsible for regulating relaxation. It is also the brain’s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, meaning that it acts as a sort of “brake” to balance out the excitatory neurotransmitters.\\nWhen GABA levels are low, your brain will produce excess adrenaline, also known as the “fight or flight” hormone, which is responsible for your feelings of anxiety, fear, and panic.\\nOriental Therapy For Panic Disorder\\nPlease attach 6 grains of millet or raw rice cut in a half to both hands with medical tapes as shown in the following pictures.

Learned helplessness is a psychological state in which the subject (ranging from rats to humanity) is unable to avoid a stressor. After being in this condition, when they are free to take action the being simply feels great fear and cannot act. With me it was school; I was depressed and only sedation allowed me to stay in my seat.\\nThe other major influence is hormonal. Researchers have found that people with anxiety disorders tend to have high levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This is particularly marked in people with social anxiety disorder. What for most people would be a touch of nervousness is for us equivalent to being charged by a lion on the Serengeti.\\nJeff   \n",

                                     Hey guys!!\\n\\nSo I’m so overtired that I can’t sleep. I have a physical condition that triggers attacks, adrenal gland issues. My cortisol levels have been up all day and I’ve been having random attacks all day.\\n\\nAnd I’m sitting here and laughing at the stupidest reasons today that triggered an attack:\\n\\n I just had an attack last night over dreaming of someone throwing a boiler at me.\\n\\nLater that same day I had an attack because I was so physically tired from physical activity that I thought my soul was legit leaving my body for absolutely no reason. The immediate thought that ran through my head was - Oh my God thank God I got a manicure yesterday, at least I won’t die ugly.\\n\\nThen I had an attack because I could potentially throw up. Like sometime in my life. Wasn’t even feeling ill or anything at the moment.\\n\\nAnd I’m sitting here laughing to myself and wanted to see what are some of y’all’s stupidest or funniest reasons you’ve had an attack over.\\n\\nLike my fiancé once got an attack because he dreamt of a wooden keg. It wasn’t doing anything, it wasn’t alive, it was just a wooden keg. He woke up drenched in sweat and shaking.\\n\\nSo what are you beatiful and brave people’s stupidest attacks?   \n",

       I saw a post or a comment a few days ago on here about someones boss saying \"I have anxiety too bro\" with a, we all live with it, kind of attitude towards the person's panic disorder. Panic disorder is far heavier than social anxiety or general anxiety. Just wanted to say something because I'll tell people I have anxiety and they'll be like, \"oh me too\". Then I'll tell them its actually a panic disorder and they dont even know what that means.   \n",

These are some things that help me and I hope they help you too!\\n\\n1. It's your body going into fight or flight mode. Your body is releasing adrenaline-you won't die from a panic attack, your body just thinks it's in danger.\\n\\n2. I always think I'm having a heart attack or dying, that I'll stop breathing or suddenly lose control- but I won't! And you won't either. Remind yourself during this time that you're having a panic attack. \\n\\n3. Move! Walk around, do some jumping jacks, dance. Anything to keep your body moving will allow it to do it's thing and move out of the mode.\\n\\n4. TALK TO YOURSELF. I can't stress this enough. When my heart is racing 1,000 miles an hour and I feel dizzy, I start talking to myself. Verbally describe your surroundings, plans for the day, or things you see out loud. Ex: \"I'm gonna make a sandwich, drink some water, the dog is taking a nice nap and sleeping on the floor, tomorrow I'm going to ____\" it sounds crazy, but it helps.\\n\\n5. If you're someone who feels like they can't breathe, remember that during a panic attack it's hard to catch a full breath and that sometimes you can't catch your breath fully even when you're calm.\\n\\n6. Pat on your legs, one after the other at a medium rate. It tricks your brain into moving the thought away.\\n\\nI hope this helps ❤ panic attacks are scary and feel life threatening, and even if you're having them constantly it's hard to remember when you're in them that it's an attack   \n",

times and had a panic attack from it now i feel like when I start to get anxious I feel like im not in my body and can't feel anything like I am numb. it isnt pins and needle numbness but like ill pick something up and it will feel like im really not picking it up and my arm isnt mine ?? I know it sounds weird but it is really hard to explain and didn't know if this was a normal part of anxiety or panic attacks. I also didn't know if i had a bit of depersonalization or derealization as especially when I am in public like in stores or just hanging out with friends ill start to feel like im in a dream and everything around me feels so weird and not real.   \n",

       "      <td>Trigger warnings: physical torture, guns, drowning, an axe.  \\n\\nSo, I want to provide context before I really get into it.    Traumatic things that I've experienced during or after my 20's I've dealt with through counseling, the 'proper' way.  Honestly with one exception, some of the things I went through as a kid make my trials as an adult look like small potatoes.\\n\\nWhen I was around 22, I was at a friend-hang in which one of the hosts had a ptsd moment and came marching out of his room holding a pistol.  Got in between him and his significant other (I've never really cared about my own self preservation, friends are different though) and managed to talk him down while he held it to my throat, he dropped the gun because he was drunk, I jumped on him when he tried to pick it up, good times.  Counseling for that, no big deal.\\n\\nBut when I was 7 or 8, I had a babysitter, Marcie.  She had two teenage daughters, a boy that was maybe 14?  and a little daughter that would have been 5 or 6.  Used to go to her house every day over one summer as both parents worked and worked damned hard to provide for us, I always kept that in mind and tried hard not to complain.\\n\\nWell, Marcie's son, I think his name was Mark, had a sadistic side to him that he seemed to reserve just for me.   I remember one time he brought me to his room to \"show me something fun\" and he shoved me to the ground and pulled an axe out of nowhere.  He dragged the sharp end along my chest, told me I'd probably die there, sprayed me in the face with cologne, then the rest was fuzzy until his mom beat on the door and found me behind that door (where he'd made me hide).. I don't remember what happened after.\\n\\n\\nAnother day, I was using the bathroom at Marcie's house and Mark managed to get in.  The next several minutes are a blur, but I do remember him using the cord of a blow dryer to bind my hands behind my back before he made me lay down in the bathtub on my back.  Then he ran cold water and blocked the drain.  Obviously I didn't die, but I have no idea how that tale ends, I just remember being certain that I was going to die.\\n\\nI've never been great at expressing myself or processing my emotions, and all of the above is stuff I'd much rather continue to forget, but I'm 30 now, and it seems like those memories just keep cropping up at random times.  I also either don't dream or I have nightmares/terrors ranging from bizarre to something people would pay to see in theaters.  \\n\\nI hate counseling and therapy.  I don't deny that they have their uses, in fact I think they're very useful tools for other people, but I've never really been able to utilize them properly due to my inability to open up.  I feel like I'm broken beyond repair.  \\n\\nAnyway, this was mostly just for me to get that stuff out, but if you have advice I'll hear it.  I'm not necessarily opposed to counseling but I think I may need advice as to how to go about it.  Mostly these days I just hate my broken self and muddle through.  Life is grim and I greet it grimly.</td>\n",

My car ended up spinning into the other lane and facing the wrong way. i constantly think about that. it was like i was waiting for the moment a car was going to hit me directly. but i was lucky. other than body aches the next day, i was fine. my car however… totaled. \\n\\ni struggled for a while without a car, stuck at my apartment, but my family helped me through it. i finally was able to replace my car with another used one, which cost a bit more than what insurance gave me for my old one, but my old one was pretty janky anyway. i’m so glad to have my freedom back, but i’m just… terrified. i now add an extra 10 mins to my commute because i can’t breathe on the highway anymore. i’m constantly nervous about other cars while i drive, especially when it’s a car next to me in the other lane. i also think about cars heading the opposite direction, swerving and hitting me head on. obsessively, like, unless i’m able to keep myself distracted with a podcast or something, it’s every single car i pass. i know part of my anxiety is just the fact that i don’t want anything bad to happen to this car, and i’m still getting used to driving it. it’s a bit bigger than my pervious car. to an extent, I’ve always been an anxious driver, but i actually really enjoy driving. it’s very freeing. other people on the road make me nervous. but it’s never been this bad before. i keep having dreams about it. i dread leaving my apartment. i work nights, so i actually feel a little less anxious driving home because there’s less people on the road and i can get away with driving a little slow. before the wreck i used to love to go at least 5 above the speed limit, but now i have to remind myself to go the speed limit. \\ni know this will pass and “shit happens” (not kidding, is what my dad said when i called him after the crash). but then a week ago my childhood family dog died, and now i can feel myself spiraling a bit. i’m doing my best to stay on top of my bills while still learning how to pay them, and i keep telling myself i’ll be fine as long as i keep going to work. this honestly wouldn’t be a big deal, except the week before i find a car, my job gets rid of our weekend shift, and I am moved to nights on weekdays. it’s not been uh, great, mostly because now i work 4 days instead of 3, but i understand that most people work 5 so i feel weird complaining. i’m lucky i was able to get my car in time, my mom was driving me on her days off. \\n\\ni just… feel overwhelmed and scared. i just want to rest and feel rested. i don’t want my apartment to feel like a pit stop. i feel weird venting because literally there are people in my family going through worse sudden life changes than me. but i cant afford therapy right now and i am honestly just… in awe at how shitty the last couple of months have been. i thought moving would be good, and don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my apartment, i worked and saved for years to be there. but i feel like i can’t process anything and haven’t had the time to. \\n\\nmy brother and i both have ocd so i know that i struggle with change and things outside my control, but when i had a conversation with my mom about my road anxieties she told me it sounds like i’m dealing with ptsd. my mom has been absolutely enabling my weed habit as a way to i guess help me cope? but i just feel constantly tired and constantly anxious. i’m trying to stay grateful. i get to be in my apartment, i have a great family supporting me through this, i have a decent job, i was able to replace my car, and i even got to be with my dog when he passed. i’m very proud of myself for being able to get this far in my life. \\n\\napologies if this is long and ramble-y and full of typos 🙏 really just needed to vent</td>\n",

I've been diagnosed by professionals with depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, adhd, ocd, and most recently PTSD. my therapist looked over my evaluation and agrees that i do show many symptoms of PTSD. in the evaluation, it talks about how i apparently disassociate my emotions from my trauma, if that makes sense. the evaluation also mentions repressed trauma, and that's what i want to talk about today.\\n\\nmy therapist and i skimmed over the evaluation together and talked about it during one of our sessions. im going to be honest, my memory is very patchy. ive noticed i forget many many details, even important ones and its pretty frustrating, so my explanation will not be perfect. but basically he mentions repressed trauma and how i seem to have it? ive told him how i have panic attacks, maybe flash backs (?) when im showering. during these moments i feel extremely panicked. i desperately try to touch the cold shower curtain, or run my fingers along the cool, wet walls of the shower. i once tried to touch the spout bcuz at this point i was on the ground struggling to breathe. the shape of the spout triggered something in me, i guess? i dont know. but i began to panic more and threw my hands back onto literally anything else. this has been happening recently a lot. \\n\\nwith that said, i also experienced these kinds of reactions when i was much younger, too. im talking maybe 6 years old, 10 years old, somewhere around that time. i have memories of having panic attacks (i think thats what they were) while showering. it was to the point of having to step out of the bathroom dripping wet and trying to catch my breath, but it never worked, obviously. i dont know why i have these reactions when i shower. i really dont know why and everytime i think about it it just makes me even more anxious and uncomfortable. just writing all this already makes me feel like im going to think of something i dont want to think about.\\n\\ni have little to no memory of anything happening in the shower that would trigger these reactions i get, except i used to shower with my mom and dad until i was in kindergarten. i dont remember anything happening, i think. i dont think either of my parents would do anything like that anyways. i do have a very very faint memory of my dad's closest friend being in the bathroom while i was showering. not sure if this even actually happened, or if it did why he was there. assuming it did happen and i wasnt dreaming, he had been in the shower or something, asking me about the water (s?). i was so young i thought water for showers came from the mountains, so i told him that. i also bragged it was filtered so we wouldn't get sick. thats all i remember.\\n\\ni really dont understand why i feel so strange and stressed recently. i'd also like to note i've been struggling with a SH addiction for years and hurt myself intentionally for the first time when i was 9 years old. another thing i think it worth mentioning is that my parents were very violent and hostile as a kid. its gotten better now though, so i dont know why im still struggling so much. i have been sa'd a few times as well. it haunts me and i try not to think about it. \\n\\ni just want anyones opinions or advice, i guess. my therapist and psychologist (i think thats was she was) both recommended EMDR therapy and/or residency, however residency was mentioned a few months ago and i dont bring it up often with them bcuz i hate inpatient. please, does it seem like i have repressed trauma? im so lost and confused and distressed, if anyone has any thoughts on this, please let me know.</td>\n",

I was beaten and had my head slammed into a wall so hard it bled while he groped me. I honestly believe he would have forced himself on me fully but I was able to hurt him bad enough in self defense to run away and hide. \\n\\nAt 15, my at the time girlfriend, who was heavily abusive in every sense of the word also assaulted me at school. This time was in front of a group of her friends and she forced me and held me down on the floor while she touched me under the pretense of trying to get my phone out of my pants. There had been no sexual contact between us before this incident.

I have been in therapy most of my adult life and find that the longer I have gone in therapy, the better I am. Will I always need therapy? Possibly. As frequent or as often? Probably not. My life ebbs and flows based on my overwhelm, triggering, and ability to cope.\\nC-PTSD takes a long time to process all the ‘channels’ of trauma. Usually this type of trauma look years to occur, so it may take years to work through. I have found that the most dynamic change in my own life is when I am triggered, the time to rebound back is much less than it used to be. I have learned a lot of coping skills. The most difficult work is reframing the negative core beliefs that I still can operate from if in the right circumstances/environment.\\nIt’s imperative that your therapist is trained in trauma, specifically complex trauma. I found that CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) was helpful, but EMDR / Emotional / Body processing was far more effective as the trauma was stored in the unconscious parts of my brain.

       "      <td>I think I need some clarity on this question: do you mean what's the most therapeutically effective way, or what is the best approach, in terms of the therapist’s interpersonal approach?\\nBecause I think both are relevant. Most specialists in C/PTSD these days believe that a combination of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) are proven to provide the quickest benefits and progress and, thus, are the preferred options for treatment— especially of severe PTSD and/or CPTSD.\\nTHAT SAID, there are kind of two camps in terms of how PTSD therapies should progress. Some people feel that C/PTSD specialists should focus, with specificity, on the/a specific set of events and situations which are deemed to be either directly or primarily responsible for the C/PTSD response.\\nThat means that, rather than to allow the direction of the therapy to be more patient-driven, they tend to believe that addressing, head on, and treating the primary issues/events that caused the client to develop C/PTSD, the other contemporaneous problems the clients may have in their lives will naturally benefit. So therapists in this camp tend to gravitate toward more linear approaches in their treatments—that is, to tackle the worst events first and then decide, with some patient input, where to go next.\\nWhereas, the other camp believes that the patient should, to the greatest extent possible, guide the direction of therapy.\\nThis is especially helpful for clients that: 1) have CPTSD due to multiple severe traumatic experiences, childhood trauma, etc., and 2) have ongoing significant stressors in their lives that cause them significant distress and/or exacerbate their C/PTSD.\\nThis often is the preferred choice for such clients because it fosters in the client a sense of personal control— something C/PTSD almost always robs them of. Also, it allows the client to simultaneously focus on the EFFECTS of the events that caused their C/PTSD responses as well as the learned responses and behaviors that resulted— something particularly useful for patients who have a series of highly traumatic events and/or current severe stressors in their lives.\\nI definitely prefer the latter— patient driven direction— because I find that most clients tend to have a significant understanding of where they are on the “vulnerability meter”— in other words, if they are having a better day, they often feel better equipped to tackle a much more severe trauma event. And if they are feeling overwhelmed by current life stressors or particularly vulnerable or fragile, trying to push them toward harder work where they have less say and control over where the therapy is going can have, at best, a diminishing impact on their sense of progress and safety and, at worst, can catapult them into very dangerous waters, in terms of their fragility.\\nIn the end, I think therapists have to trust their clients to be able to guide them where they need to go at the time. Obviously, we all have avoidant clients, but showing them that trust and offering the client the gift of controlling their own progress it another way that we can demonstrate to clients that we are on their sides and trust their judgement when it comes to the direction of therapeutic resolution.</td>\n",

Mankind is a specialist charity that solely works with Men that have been in receipt of unwanted sexual/physical/emotional abuses. In the UK 125,000 est. Men per year approx 40% of the predators are female. Nearly all clients had developed C-PTSD, PTSD or PTS.\\nWhether EMDR, Tapping,CBT, polyvagel, sensate focused, EFT, DLT, humanistic, mindfulness, talking therapies or a wealth of other fantastic therapeutic models that these resource-full answers hold, I have found that this is the most client led model and for a very specific reason…POWER.\\nThe client has to be in control, has to breathe and eat control, has to have the resources to access control interventions and develop strategies to self regulate, and their partners to co-regulate and when they come to us they are handing over a little bit of control, just a tad.\\nScaling, colouring, breathing, visualisations, safe space, rewind, safety and stabilisation techniques, dancing, drumming, raging, bashing, screaming and a whole cupboard of other resources have always been the anchor to the clients new world as we inch along with the therapy at the speed that they choose, and why? because some horrible person or people took that control and safety away. And I know exactly what it feels like.\\nI have two highly skilled S/V that have shared that EMDR works only for 50% of their and their supervisees clients, that CBT works for 14.8% of clients within the British NHS and all the other modalities have their successes and detractors so there is no ‘best’.\\nIts useful to know that the range of trauma informed modalities have been created because of so many complex cases but these modalities are like bright,shiny things to a C_PTSD magpie but hopefully that magpie finds a nest that they can thrive inside, to feel safe, met, seen and resourced and yes it can take a very long time but neural plasticity as previously mentioned is key and offers so much hope.</td>\n",

Traumatic things that I've experienced during or after my 20's I've dealt with through counseling, the 'proper' way.  Honestly with one exception, some of the things I went through as a kid make my trials as an adult look like small potatoes.\\n\\nWhen I was around 22, I was at a friend-hang in which one of the hosts had a ptsd moment and came marching out of his room holding a pistol.  Got in between him and his significant other (I've never really cared about my own self preservation, friends are different though) and managed to talk him down while he held it to my throat, he dropped the gun because he was drunk, I jumped on him when he tried to pick it up, good times.  Counseling for that, no big deal.\\n\\nBut when I was 7 or 8, I had a babysitter, Marcie.  She had two teenage daughters, a boy that was maybe 14?  and a little daughter that would have been 5 or 6.  Used to go to her house every day over one summer as both parents worked and worked damned hard to provide for us, I always kept that in mind and tried hard not to complain.\\n\\nWell, Marcie's son, I think his name was Mark, had a sadistic side to him that he seemed to reserve just for me.   I remember one time he brought me to his room to \"show me something fun\" and he shoved me to the ground and pulled an axe out of nowhere.  He dragged the sharp end along my chest, told me I'd probably die there, sprayed me in the face with cologne, then the rest was fuzzy until his mom beat on the door and found me behind that door (where he'd made me hide).. I don't remember what happened after.\\n\\n\\nAnother day, I was using the bathroom at Marcie's house and Mark managed to get in.  The next several minutes are a blur, but I do remember him using the cord of a blow dryer to bind my hands behind my back before he made me lay down in the bathtub on my back.  Then he ran cold water and blocked the drain.  Obviously I didn't die, but I have no idea how that tale ends, I just remember being certain that I was going to die.\\n\\nI've never been great at expressing myself or processing my emotions, and all of the above is stuff I'd much rather continue to forget, but I'm 30 now, and it seems like those memories just keep cropping up at random times.  I also either don't dream or I have nightmares/terrors ranging from bizarre to something people would pay to see in theaters.  \\n\\nI hate counseling and therapy.  I don't deny that they have their uses, in fact I think they're very useful tools for other people, but I've never really been able to utilize them properly due to my inability to open up.  I feel like I'm broken beyond repair.  \\n\\nAnyway, this was mostly just for me to get that stuff out, but if you have advice I'll hear it.  I'm not necessarily opposed to counseling but I think I may need advice as to how to go about it.  Mostly these days I just hate my broken self and muddle through.  Life is grim and I greet it grimly.   \n",

       "2     (content warning for car wrecks, pet death, and drug use) i (f25) got into my first real car wreck 2 months ago, about a month after moving into an apartment on my own for the first time. a car in the lane next to me blew a tire and lost control, hitting my back tire. the police later told me that i got pit maneuvered. My car ended up spinning into the other lane and facing the wrong way. i constantly think about that. it was like i was waiting for the moment a car was going to hit me directly. but i was lucky. other than body aches the next day, i was fine. my car however… totaled. \\n\\ni struggled for a while without a car, stuck at my apartment, but my family helped me through it. i finally was able to replace my car with another used one, which cost a bit more than what insurance gave me for my old one, but my old one was pretty janky anyway. i’m so glad to have my freedom back, but i’m just… terrified. i now add an extra 10 mins to my commute because i can’t breathe on the highway anymore. i’m constantly nervous about other cars while i drive, especially when it’s a car next to me in the other lane. i also think about cars heading the opposite direction, swerving and hitting me head on. obsessively, like, unless i’m able to keep myself distracted with a podcast or something, it’s every single car i pass. i know part of my anxiety is just the fact that i don’t want anything bad to happen to this car, and i’m still getting used to driving it. it’s a bit bigger than my pervious car. to an extent, I’ve always been an anxious driver, but i actually really enjoy driving. it’s very freeing. other people on the road make me nervous. but it’s never been this bad before. i keep having dreams about it. i dread leaving my apartment. i work nights, so i actually feel a little less anxious driving home because there’s less people on the road and i can get away with driving a little slow. before the wreck i used to love to go at least 5 above the speed limit, but now i have to remind myself to go the speed limit. \\ni know this will pass and “shit happens” (not kidding, is what my dad said when i called him after the crash). but then a week ago my childhood family dog died, and now i can feel myself spiraling a bit. i’m doing my best to stay on top of my bills while still learning how to pay them, and i keep telling myself i’ll be fine as long as i keep going to work. this honestly wouldn’t be a big deal, except the week before i find a car, my job gets rid of our weekend shift, and I am moved to nights on weekdays. it’s not been uh, great, mostly because now i work 4 days instead of 3, but i understand that most people work 5 so i feel weird complaining. i’m lucky i was able to get my car in time, my mom was driving me on her days off. \\n\\ni just… feel overwhelmed and scared. i just want to rest and feel rested. i don’t want my apartment to feel like a pit stop. i feel weird venting because literally there are people in my family going through worse sudden life changes than me. but i cant afford therapy right now and i am honestly just… in awe at how shitty the last couple of months have been. i thought moving would be good, and don’t get me wrong, I LOVE my apartment, i worked and saved for years to be there. but i feel like i can’t process anything and haven’t had the time to. \\n\\nmy brother and i both have ocd so i know that i struggle with change and things outside my control, but when i had a conversation with my mom about my road anxieties she told me it sounds like i’m dealing with ptsd. my mom has been absolutely enabling my weed habit as a way to i guess help me cope? but i just feel constantly tired and constantly anxious. i’m trying to stay grateful. i get to be in my apartment, i have a great family supporting me through this, i have a decent job, i was able to replace my car, and i even got to be with my dog when he passed. i’m very proud of myself for being able to get this far in my life. \\n\\napologies if this is long and ramble-y and full of typos 🙏 really just needed to vent   \n",

I've been diagnosed by professionals with depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, adhd, ocd, and most recently PTSD. my therapist looked over my evaluation and agrees that i do show many symptoms of PTSD. in the evaluation, it talks about how i apparently disassociate my emotions from my trauma, if that makes sense. the evaluation also mentions repressed trauma, and that's what i want to talk about today.\\n\\nmy therapist and i skimmed over the evaluation together and talked about it during one of our sessions. im going to be honest, my memory is very patchy. ive noticed i forget many many details, even important ones and its pretty frustrating, so my explanation will not be perfect. but basically he mentions repressed trauma and how i seem to have it? ive told him how i have panic attacks, maybe flash backs (?) when im showering. during these moments i feel extremely panicked. i desperately try to touch the cold shower curtain, or run my fingers along the cool, wet walls of the shower. i once tried to touch the spout bcuz at this point i was on the ground struggling to breathe. the shape of the spout triggered something in me, i guess? i dont know. but i began to panic more and threw my hands back onto literally anything else. this has been happening recently a lot. \\n\\nwith that said, i also experienced these kinds of reactions when i was much younger, too. im talking maybe 6 years old, 10 years old, somewhere around that time. i have memories of having panic attacks (i think thats what they were) while showering. it was to the point of having to step out of the bathroom dripping wet and trying to catch my breath, but it never worked, obviously. i dont know why i have these reactions when i shower. i really dont know why and everytime i think about it it just makes me even more anxious and uncomfortable. just writing all this already makes me feel like im going to think of something i dont want to think about.\\n\\ni have little to no memory of anything happening in the shower that would trigger these reactions i get, except i used to shower with my mom and dad until i was in kindergarten. i dont remember anything happening, i think. i dont think either of my parents would do anything like that anyways. i do have a very very faint memory of my dad's closest friend being in the bathroom while i was showering. not sure if this even actually happened, or if it did why he was there. assuming it did happen and i wasnt dreaming, he had been in the shower or something, asking me about the water (s?). i was so young i thought water for showers came from the mountains, so i told him that. i also bragged it was filtered so we wouldn't get sick. thats all i remember.\\n\\ni really dont understand why i feel so strange and stressed recently. i'd also like to note i've been struggling with a SH addiction for years and hurt myself intentionally for the first time when i was 9 years old. another thing i think it worth mentioning is that my parents were very violent and hostile as a kid. its gotten better now though, so i dont know why im still struggling so much. i have been sa'd a few times as well. it haunts me and i try not to think about it. \\n\\ni just want anyones opinions or advice, i guess. my therapist and psychologist (i think thats was she was) both recommended EMDR therapy and/or residency, however residency was mentioned a few months ago and i dont bring it up often with them bcuz i hate inpatient. please, does it seem like i have repressed trauma? im so lost and confused and distressed, if anyone has any thoughts on this, please let me know.    \n",

I replay these 2 particular incidents over and over in my head all the time and even though I know and have been told by my therapist and a couple other friends that what happened was sexual assault and really bad, I can’t help but to always feel like I’m overreacting and what happened to me is not that bad because neither attack was able to reach completion. \\n\\nAt 14 I was violently attacked by my at the time recently ex-boyfriend at school. I was beaten and had my head slammed into a wall so hard it bled while he groped me. I honestly believe he would have forced himself on me fully but I was able to hurt him bad enough in self defense to run away and hide. \\n\\nAt 15, my at the time girlfriend, who was heavily abusive in every sense of the word also assaulted me at school. This time was in front of a group of her friends and she forced me and held me down on the floor while she touched me under the pretense of trying to get my phone out of my pants. There had been no sexual contact between us before this incident. Eventually she let me get up and it didn’t go further than the touching. \\n\\nBoth incidents didn’t reach the point of penetration and were given reactions as if they weren’t anything serious at the time that they happened to me. I never reported either and blocked them out for years until recently. I think that’s why I minimize them to myself so much, but I can’t help always wondering if they really aren’t as bad as they feel in my mind   \n",

I have been in therapy most of my adult life and find that the longer I have gone in therapy, the better I am. Will I always need therapy? Possibly. As frequent or as often? Probably not. My life ebbs and flows based on my overwhelm, triggering, and ability to cope.\\nC-PTSD takes a long time to process all the ‘channels’ of trauma. Usually this type of trauma look years to occur, so it may take years to work through. I have found that the most dynamic change in my own life is when I am triggered, the time to rebound back is much less than it used to be. I have learned a lot of coping skills. The most difficult work is reframing the negative core beliefs that I still can operate from if in the right circumstances/environment.\\nIt’s imperative that your therapist is trained in trauma, specifically complex trauma. I found that CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) was helpful, but EMDR / Emotional / Body processing was far more effective as the trauma was stored in the unconscious parts of my brain.

Most specialists in C/PTSD these days believe that a combination of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) are proven to provide the quickest benefits and progress and, thus, are the preferred options for treatment— especially of severe PTSD and/or CPTSD.\\nTHAT SAID, there are kind of two camps in terms of how PTSD therapies should progress. Some people feel that C/PTSD specialists should focus, with specificity, on the/a specific set of events and situations which are deemed to be either directly or primarily responsible for the C/PTSD response.\\nThat means that, rather than to allow the direction of the therapy to be more patient-driven, they tend to believe that addressing, head on, and treating the primary issues/events that caused the client to develop C/PTSD, the other contemporaneous problems the clients may have in their lives will naturally benefit. So therapists in this camp tend to gravitate toward more linear approaches in their treatments—that is, to tackle the worst events first and then decide, with some patient input, where to go next.\\nWhereas, the other camp believes that the patient should, to the greatest extent possible, guide the direction of therapy.\\nThis is especially helpful for clients that: 1) have CPTSD due to multiple severe traumatic experiences, childhood trauma, etc., and 2) have ongoing significant stressors in their lives that cause them significant distress and/or exacerbate their C/PTSD.\\nThis often is the preferred choice for such clients because it fosters in the client a sense of personal control— something C/PTSD almost always robs them of. Also, it allows the client to simultaneously focus on the EFFECTS of the events that caused their C/PTSD responses as well as the learned responses and behaviors that resulted— something particularly useful for patients who have a series of highly traumatic events and/or current severe stressors in their lives.\\nI definitely prefer the latter— patient driven direction— because I find that most clients tend to have a significant understanding of where they are on the “vulnerability meter”— in other words, if they are having a better day, they often feel better equipped to tackle a much more severe trauma event. And if they are feeling overwhelmed by current life stressors or particularly vulnerable or fragile, trying to push them toward harder work where they have less say and control over where the therapy is going can have, at best, a diminishing impact on their sense of progress and safety and, at worst, can catapult them into very dangerous waters, in terms of their fragility.\\nIn the end, I think therapists have to trust their clients to be able to guide them where they need to go at the time. Obviously, we all have avoidant clients, but showing them that trust and offering the client the gift of controlling their own progress it another way that we can demonstrate to clients that we are on their sides and trust their judgement when it comes to the direction of therapeutic resolution.   \n",

Mankind is a specialist charity that solely works with Men that have been in receipt of unwanted sexual/physical/emotional abuses. In the UK 125,000 est. Men per year approx 40% of the predators are female. Nearly all clients had developed C-PTSD, PTSD or PTS.\\nWhether EMDR, Tapping,CBT, polyvagel, sensate focused, EFT, DLT, humanistic, mindfulness, talking therapies or a wealth of other fantastic therapeutic models that these resource-full answers hold, I have found that this is the most client led model and for a very specific reason…POWER.\\nThe client has to be in control, has to breathe and eat control, has to have the resources to access control interventions and develop strategies to self regulate, and their partners to co-regulate and when they come to us they are handing over a little bit of control, just a tad.\\nScaling, colouring, breathing, visualisations, safe space, rewind, safety and stabilisation techniques, dancing, drumming, raging, bashing, screaming and a whole cupboard of other resources have always been the anchor to the clients new world as we inch along with the therapy at the speed that they choose, and why? because some horrible person or people took that control and safety away. And I know exactly what it feels like.\\nI have two highly skilled S/V that have shared that EMDR works only for 50% of their and their supervisees clients, that CBT works for 14.8% of clients within the British NHS and all the other modalities have their successes and detractors so there is no ‘best’.\\nIts useful to know that the range of trauma informed modalities have been created because of so many complex cases but these modalities are like bright,shiny things to a C_PTSD magpie but hopefully that magpie finds a nest that they can thrive inside, to feel safe, met, seen and resourced and yes it can take a very long time but neural plasticity as previously mentioned is key and offers so much hope.   \n",

The symptoms of C-PTSD can include flashbacks, emotional regulation difficulties, relationship problems, and a negative self-image, among others.\\nThe treatment of C-PTSD typically involves psychotherapy, talktoangel help medication, or a combination of both. There is no one \"best\" way to treat C-PTSD, as different people may respond better to different approaches depending on their individual needs and circumstances.   \n",

Then first question is what type of therapeutic intervention do you best benefit from: Cognitive behavioral, interpersonal, skills acquisition, medication assisted treatment, dialectical behaviorial therapy, Prolonged exposure therapy, Group therapy with other patients with similar trauma. EMDR or something else. The best therapeutic intervention for you will indicate the intensity and the length of time for the therapeutic relationship   \n",

       "      <td>It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.\\nFor instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the \"riddle\" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.\\nThe day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.\\nAnother time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?\\nA few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.\\nAnother time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.\\nI have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.\\nNow the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.\\nUpdate 15/11/14\\nThank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but</td>\n",

I wake up in the morning to atleast 5 people in my room,faces I've never seen before, they ignore me as I walk out of my room, when I light up my morning cigarette I hear them say \" she's going to die before we get to her\" which is terrifying to hear, then they say \" we wait till till she's asleep, we preform the procedure \" what procedure? What are they talking about? When I get back into my room they are FBI agents, they tell me to leave but don't go outside BUT LEAVE.. ?? I also I see human bodies with animal head that tower over houses and stare at me from a distance, I see bodies hanging from doorways I see ceiling fans spinning on the grass, I see black hands coming out of faucets and drains, mirrors, walls. I hear a voice , a \"robot voice\" that keeps me up at night, saying things like \" my programming tells me you love me! You can't leave me, you are mine, you can't leave me YOU ARE MINE\" and things in that context. But my main most important hallucination is jack, he is a tall well kept man, blonddish white hair a top hat and a orange suit, he was my very first hallucination, he was evil, he was my worst nightmare and more. After these 6 years, he has taken form of my friends, lovers, family, it's so hard to look at him. But he also is always there when I have panic attacks, or I'm anxious, paranoid or worrying, he makes sure I am safe.

They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.\\nI was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.\\nJust one day of my life…\\nMy brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.\\nI’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!\\nI will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.\\nMy 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.\\nI thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.\\nI cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it.

During the examinations, one night I opened the locks of my door and I ran away from my house, barefoot. For around seventy-hours, I was loitering in the streets with no food, water, money, shoes or even clothes. I slept on the streets and sometimes the weather was fierce like heavy rainfall etc. Goons tried to kill me. Some had even beaten me. I came in front of a fast moving car but miraculously survived. After three days, I found someone who gave me clothes and then he brought me home.\\nAfter reaching my house, I was rushed to a hospital. There my hands and feet were all tied up and I was given multiple shots of injection. I could barely walk, talk or eat with my hands then.\\nAfter around two weeks I was taken back to my house. I continued my medication but after a few months my medications were stopped as my parents thought that I had recovered.\\nIn July 2006, I was rushed to a neuropsychologist because I was talking nonsense and behaving weirdly. I was told in my report that besides schizophrenia I had developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder) due to the side effects of medications. I again had to be given medications.\\nSome of my weird experiences during those time were :\\n1. I thought I was Lord Krishna and that people respect/worship me. I sometimes even made poses like him (in public places) as if he was standing in a dancing pose holding the flute. I also believed that I was Lord Buddha who has attained nirvana.\\n2. I thought that Hilary Duff was my soulmate and that she would marry me. I thought she was sending me special messages via the TV.\\n3. I thought that I was responsible for the deaths of people who have died in plane crash and in 9/11. I even cried a lot for feeling guilty (in public)\\n4. I thought the TV news anchors were speaking about me.\\n5. I felt beautiful smell of roses were coming out of HBO TV channel and that the smell color was green.\\n6. I felt I could control the movement of the sun or I could control the weather. I felt I could move ceiling fan with the help of my mind only.\\n7. I thought people were inserting their fists in my anus and taking away my knowledge, intelligence. This thought was intense and scared me a lot.\\n8. I often went out of my house with shirts buttoned in wrong places and with only one shoe in my feet.\\n9. I heard airplanes flying everyday at some specific times .\\n1o. I thought I had cancer, malaria, aids etc. and that Bill Gates was looking to cure my illnesses. I even thought that he would fly a special plane directly to my house and take me to US.\\n11. I thought President Bush was trying to recruit me in the Secret Service because I thought that I was psychic.\\n12. I felt people could read my thoughts and insert their thoughts in my head.\\n13. Once a car driver was trash talking to another driver in filthy language. I thought they were talking about me (which was of course not true)\\n14. Once I had to visit my doctor. Now the doctor's clinic was just beside a school for the blind. My mother was on the phone talking to my father who was giving her directions of the doc's clinic and referred to the blind school. I screamed loudly to mom saying, \" please don't take me to the blind school as I was not blind.\"\\n15. I thought I was special. One day a teacher entered the classroom. Obviously the teacher was standing on entering the classroom. On seeing the teacher other students also stood up and said good morning. I remained seated because I thought that I had special psychic powers and that I was their boss so they were all standing and I could sit.\\n16. I was once going to my doctor, in a rented car. My father was sitting beside me in the back seat. There were two people in the front. After some time, in the middle of the journey I raised both my arms thinking that I was God and I started saying something loudly. I thought I was God and that I had special powers. That was very embarrassing as not only the strangers in the front but also the general crowd (in traffic jams) could see the way I was behaving.\\n17. I thought I could move objects with my mind, had seen ghosts, devil. I even thought that the word/concept \"eternity\" was actually a living being and that he has been my friend millions of yrs ago and that now he was calling me.\\n18. I did not care to take care of my hygiene. During that period I rarely brushed or had shower.\\n19. I thought people in Africa were starving so I often refused to eat my food feeling guilty that while I was filling my stomach, they starved.\\n20. I thought people were throwing stones/bricks at my house at night because I felt that they knew I have caused all the problems in the world (which was of course false)\\nMost of the above things happened in 2005-2006.\\nFast forward to 2016.\\nIn August 2016, my doctor stopped my medications. I no longer take them. I have a MBA (marketing) degree from a reputed college. I also started working in a bank from last week. I have a few close friends and I am in a relationship for over two years.\\nI have experienced a lot in my life and I believe that there is a lot left to learn and experience. I believe schizophrenia can be a \"gift\" only if we are aware of this illness and accept the fact that something is not right with us. By doing so, we can reduce the effect of the illness to a great extent.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I never could have dreamed how much better life could get from when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017. Back then, everything seemed hopeless. \\nSince then, I've gotten married, become an artist, found beliefs and faith that work for me, traveled internationally, improved my relationships, and now I am pregnant. \\nIt has taken years to stabilize. It didn't happen overnight. A lot of what causes hallucination attacks- strong emotional states like shame, fear and worthlessness- have been dealt with in therapy and through my own efforts to heal. I still hallucinate every now and then, but it is rare. I find it is almost always triggered by strong emotions/ provoking situations. \\nExternal factors, such as medication, art, therapy and relationships have their part to play in my health. There are many reasons my life has balanced out. \\nI sincerely wish happiness and peace for all who suffer with this disorder. It took a lot of uncovering and facing pain and much suffering for me to find a place of equilibrium. \\nI know it's extremely challenging to find stability so I certainly feel deeply for those who are currently struggling with stabilizing. I don't have things perfectly figured out and I still sometimes suffer when I hallucinate.\\nBecoming a parent takes self-control, compassion and playfulness. I couldn't have done it years ago, but each stage of life requires a new shedding of the skin, without shame for the previous one worn. \\nThis already is a challenging yet exciting journey!</td>\n",

       "      <td>When I first got diagnosed in a hospital  I thought of it as a death sentence. I was 18(20 now) and I knew it was progressive. I thought about the horror stories of losing my family and becoming homeless or having to take meds that’ll make me fat and lay in bed wanting to die all day. And the more I thought like that, the more it became true. \\n\\nBut I can say now that I’m doing really well. I got on abilify and for whatever reason it works better than Zyprexa. I have a job, a place to sleep, I call my family every day to wish them a good day and to show them that I’m in a good place mentally. I’ve begun programming and working on projects. I have friends, I no longer abuse drugs, etc. \\n\\nSometimes though I do still experience psychosis and even at work. But to me it’s nothing to be scared of. It’s like back pain. Some people experience it temporarily while other people it’s an everyday struggle. Schizophrenia to me is my form of back pain. And now that I’ve learned more about the illness and my specific delusions that come up I can dismiss it and move on with my day. The voices can be scary but when they happen(99% after I get off work). I take a nice warm shower. Lay in bed, and take a sleeping pill and pass out. \\n\\nThis illness CAN ruin your life, but I won’t let it happen to me. I’ve reached out for help from god, doctors, and my family. I want to help people who are not as fortunate to have those resources. Because even though there’s not a cure there is hope to live a happy life</td>\n",

In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.\\nFor instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the \"riddle\" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.\\nThe day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.\\nAnother time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?\\nA few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.\\nAnother time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.\\nI have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.\\nNow the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.\\nUpdate 15/11/14\\nThank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but   \n",

It is NOT fun. I wake up in the morning to atleast 5 people in my room,faces I've never seen before, they ignore me as I walk out of my room, when I light up my morning cigarette I hear them say \" she's going to die before we get to her\" which is terrifying to hear, then they say \" we wait till till she's asleep, we preform the procedure \" what procedure? What are they talking about? When I get back into my room they are FBI agents, they tell me to leave but don't go outside BUT LEAVE.. ?? I also I see human bodies with animal head that tower over houses and stare at me from a distance, I see bodies hanging from doorways I see ceiling fans spinning on the grass, I see black hands coming out of faucets and drains, mirrors, walls. I hear a voice , a \"robot voice\" that keeps me up at night, saying things like \" my programming tells me you love me! You can't leave me, you are mine, you can't leave me YOU ARE MINE\" and things in that context. But my main most important hallucination is jack, he is a tall well kept man, blonddish white hair a top hat and a orange suit, he was my very first hallucination, he was evil, he was my worst nightmare and more. After these 6 years, he has taken form of my friends, lovers, family, it's so hard to look at him. But he also is always there when I have panic attacks, or I'm anxious, paranoid or worrying, he makes sure I am safe. I refuse to talk back to my voices, I don't want to start falling into their shit. schizophrenia fucking SUCKS   \n",

My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.\\nI was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.\\nJust one day of my life…\\nMy brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.\\nI’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!\\nI will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.\\nMy 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.\\nI thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.\\nI cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.   \n",

We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.\\nI can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.\\nRun run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.\\nI want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.\\nAnd she’s terrified.\\nI pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.\\nWhat’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.   \n",
       "4     Well, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005. I studied in a reputed school and I was bullied heavily. My parents neglected me. My teachers ignored me. During the examinations, one night I opened the locks of my door and I ran away from my house, barefoot. For around seventy-hours, I was loitering in the streets with no food, water, money, shoes or even clothes. I slept on the streets and sometimes the weather was fierce like heavy rainfall etc. Goons tried to kill me. Some had even beaten me. I came in front of a fast moving car but miraculously survived. After three days, I found someone who gave me clothes and then he brought me home.\\nAfter reaching my house, I was rushed to a hospital. There my hands and feet were all tied up and I was given multiple shots of injection. I could barely walk, talk or eat with my hands then.\\nAfter around two weeks I was taken back to my house. I continued my medication but after a few months my medications were stopped as my parents thought that I had recovered.\\nIn July 2006, I was rushed to a neuropsychologist because I was talking nonsense and behaving weirdly. I was told in my report that besides schizophrenia I had developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder) due to the side effects of medications. I again had to be given medications.\\nSome of my weird experiences during those time were :\\n1. I thought I was Lord Krishna and that people respect/worship me. I sometimes even made poses like him (in public places) as if he was standing in a dancing pose holding the flute. I also believed that I was Lord Buddha who has attained nirvana.\\n2. I thought that Hilary Duff was my soulmate and that she would marry me. I thought she was sending me special messages via the TV.\\n3. I thought that I was responsible for the deaths of people who have died in plane crash and in 9/11. I even cried a lot for feeling guilty (in public)\\n4. I thought the TV news anchors were speaking about me.\\n5. I felt beautiful smell of roses were coming out of HBO TV channel and that the smell color was green.\\n6. I felt I could control the movement of the sun or I could control the weather. I felt I could move ceiling fan with the help of my mind only.\\n7. I thought people were inserting their fists in my anus and taking away my knowledge, intelligence. This thought was intense and scared me a lot.\\n8. I often went out of my house with shirts buttoned in wrong places and with only one shoe in my feet.\\n9. I heard airplanes flying everyday at some specific times .\\n1o. I thought I had cancer, malaria, aids etc. and that Bill Gates was looking to cure my illnesses. I even thought that he would fly a special plane directly to my house and take me to US.\\n11. I thought President Bush was trying to recruit me in the Secret Service because I thought that I was psychic.\\n12. I felt people could read my thoughts and insert their thoughts in my head.\\n13. Once a car driver was trash talking to another driver in filthy language. I thought they were talking about me (which was of course not true)\\n14. Once I had to visit my doctor. Now the doctor's clinic was just beside a school for the blind. My mother was on the phone talking to my father who was giving her directions of the doc's clinic and referred to the blind school. I screamed loudly to mom saying, \" please don't take me to the blind school as I was not blind.\"\\n15. I thought I was special. One day a teacher entered the classroom. Obviously the teacher was standing on entering the classroom. On seeing the teacher other students also stood up and said good morning. I remained seated because I thought that I had special psychic powers and that I was their boss so they were all standing and I could sit.\\n16. I was once going to my doctor, in a rented car. My father was sitting beside me in the back seat. There were two people in the front. After some time, in the middle of the journey I raised both my arms thinking that I was God and I started saying something loudly. I thought I was God and that I had special powers. That was very embarrassing as not only the strangers in the front but also the general crowd (in traffic jams) could see the way I was behaving.\\n17. I thought I could move objects with my mind, had seen ghosts, devil. I even thought that the word/concept \"eternity\" was actually a living being and that he has been my friend millions of yrs ago and that now he was calling me.\\n18. I did not care to take care of my hygiene. During that period I rarely brushed or had shower.\\n19. I thought people in Africa were starving so I often refused to eat my food feeling guilty that while I was filling my stomach, they starved.\\n20. I thought people were throwing stones/bricks at my house at night because I felt that they knew I have caused all the problems in the world (which was of course false)\\nMost of the above things happened in 2005-2006.\\nFast forward to 2016.\\nIn August 2016, my doctor stopped my medications. I no longer take them. I have a MBA (marketing) degree from a reputed college. I also started working in a bank from last week. I have a few close friends and I am in a relationship for over two years.\\nI have experienced a lot in my life and I believe that there is a lot left to learn and experience. I believe schizophrenia can be a \"gift\" only if we are aware of this illness and accept the fact that something is not right with us. By doing so, we can reduce the effect of the illness to a great extent.   \n",

Also more people with anxiety, depression, panic attacks etc. \\n\\nIt’s really sad the way it’s impacted me and my family. My advice would be don’t touch the stuff. It’s not worth it.\\n   \n",

Back then, everything seemed hopeless. \\nSince then, I've gotten married, become an artist, found beliefs and faith that work for me, traveled internationally, improved my relationships, and now I am pregnant. \\nIt has taken years to stabilize. It didn't happen overnight. A lot of what causes hallucination attacks- strong emotional states like shame, fear and worthlessness- have been dealt with in therapy and through my own efforts to heal. I still hallucinate every now and then, but it is rare. I find it is almost always triggered by strong emotions/ provoking situations. \\nExternal factors, such as medication, art, therapy and relationships have their part to play in my health. There are many reasons my life has balanced out. \\nI sincerely wish happiness and peace for all who suffer with this disorder. It took a lot of uncovering and facing pain and much suffering for me to find a place of equilibrium. \\nI know it's extremely challenging to find stability so I certainly feel deeply for those who are currently struggling with stabilizing. I don't have things perfectly figured out and I still sometimes suffer when I hallucinate.\\nBecoming a parent takes self-control, compassion and playfulness. I couldn't have done it years ago, but each stage of life requires a new shedding of the skin, without shame for the previous one worn. \\nThis already is a challenging yet exciting journey!   \n",

I was 18(20 now) and I knew it was progressive. I thought about the horror stories of losing my family and becoming homeless or having to take meds that’ll make me fat and lay in bed wanting to die all day. And the more I thought like that, the more it became true. \\n\\nBut I can say now that I’m doing really well. I got on abilify and for whatever reason it works better than Zyprexa. I have a job, a place to sleep, I call my family every day to wish them a good day and to show them that I’m in a good place mentally. I’ve begun programming and working on projects. I have friends, I no longer abuse drugs, etc. \\n\\nSometimes though I do still experience psychosis and even at work. But to me it’s nothing to be scared of. It’s like back pain. Some people experience it temporarily while other people it’s an everyday struggle. Schizophrenia to me is my form of back pain. And now that I’ve learned more about the illness and my specific delusions that come up I can dismiss it and move on with my day. The voices can be scary but when they happen(99% after I get off work). I take a nice warm shower. Lay in bed, and take a sleeping pill and pass out. \\n\\nThis illness CAN ruin your life, but I won’t let it happen to me. I’ve reached out for help from god, doctors, and my family. I want to help people who are not as fortunate to have those resources. Because even though there’s not a cure there is hope to live a happy life   \n",

And your parents wonder how they brought up such a disrespectful brat.\\nYou are sitting in a crowded room with no one giving a crap about you. But in your head, all you can think of is that the spotlight is on you and you are being judged left and right.\\nYou walk with your head held down. You are too scared to meet the eyes.\\nPublic speaking is scarier than a suicide dive off the Burj Khalifa.\\nA couple of hours at a party among strangers is more exhausting than a round trip around the earth twice.\\nIf you had to choose between death and approaching your crush, you would voluntarily dig a grave and bury yourself in it.\\nYour phone is vital. You can pretend to be doing something on it if you happen to be sitting alone in a crowded room.\\nYou are petrified of walking into a room full of people. And if you are made to stand in front of them, your heart forgets it has to pump blood and soon you find yourself losing your balance and in the worst case, falling down unconscious.\\nYou rehearse “hello” with every ring your phone makes while calling someone.\\nYou don’t like people calling you. And you have made the “sorry mate, I was asleep” excuse so many times that a few people think you are in a perpetual state of sleep when you aren’t with them.\\nYou try and pretend to be normal while talking to someone from the opposite sex but one can hear your galloping heartbeats even from Pluto.\\nWinning a Nobel Prize seems easier than small talks.\\n98% of people who see you everyday have never heard your voice.\\nYour dream vacation is the one you spend locked inside your room surfing the internet.\\nA lot of people unfamiliar with social anxiety might think the above symptoms relate well with “shyness”. Well, they are poles apart. Shyness is a trait, social anxiety is a struggle.\\n“Shyness” is a part and parcel of a shy person. That is how they are. They accept it and learn to live with it eventually. Some break out of their shells as they grow older. Social Anxiety on the other hand is different. It is not a character trait of a person. It is picked up by the person along the journey of life. A person just can’t decide one morning that he or she wouldn’t be anxious anymore. It just doesn’t work that way. Social Anxiety is a disorder. And it takes a lot away from a person. Other answers on this thread do more justice to the question.\\nSocial Anxiety is different from “introversion”. Introversion is your way while social anxiety gets in your way. You learn to live with introversion at some point of your life, you might even transition to an ambivert or an extrovert, but with social anxiety, you know there is something wrong with you. And unfortunately, the mainstream barely relates with you. It’s worthless sharing your concerns with someone. The most enlightening and frequent advise I ever got from people was “stop caring”. Yeah, as if there is a switch that turns caring off or on.\\nNever ask a socially anxious person why they are this way. They have been looking for an answer to this question all their lives.\\nEdit: Due to the amount of attention this answer garnered, I earned a lot of non-Indian followers overtime, some of them indulged in psychiatric study, some of them victims of social anxiety who could relate and some who felt I write on this topic often.\\nBut I would request the readers to not follow me on this answer alone. My answers are strictly India centric, relating more to academic examinations in India, stuff that you will hardly relate to. I appreciate the appreciation. Thank you so much!\\nIt will be four years of me writing this answer in a few months. Things have been better for me. Of course, it is hard to forget how I was robbed off a normal life, about the fun I missed out on, about how I was never the one to approach the friends I have today, all thanks to social anxiety. It illusion-ed me into believing that I was an introvert when I am more of an ambivert. I like being with people, chilling out with them, having fun. I like attention. But thanks to social anxiety, I have always been an outcaste. I am still not comfortable in my own skin. I still carry those deep insecurities 24*7. But guess what, over time it has only gotten better. And if I compare myself to when I had written this, I’d barely be able to recognize myself. Felt like adding this edit for all the depressed, anxious teenagers. There is light at the end of the tunnel. It won’t always be this way. Never be afraid to seek help.</td>\n",

I have a moderate level of social anxiety (not so severe that I have actual physical panic attacks) but these are some examples of what I’m dealing with.\\nPushing people away. Friends, relatives, acquaintances, it’s hard to try and keep contact with them. As soon as I feel like I’m getting close with someone or we’re actually making conversation, I can’t help but feel as if I annoying the other person and they don’t actually wanna be near me, even when they show strong signs that they really like me.\\nFeeling like you don’t fit in to any group. You’re in class, and the teacher announces an activity for the class to do. Nothing really alarming yet, until she mentions the word “groups”. I say to myself “Oh great, now I’m just going to annoy more people, no-one even wants me in there group”, and when I join the group, it affects me as it makes me feel bad about myself and I become more silent.\\nHaving a boring, bordered life. My normal routine just consists of waking up, eating, going to school, using my phone and laptop, and sleeping. That’s it. I always feel like I have a lot of adrenaline in me and I feel like going out somewhere, but then my anxiety kicks in, telling me “who would want to go with you anyways” and “everyone out there is going to look at you and how ugly you are”. So I just stay at home all the time (other than going school) and I rarely go outside (only about once a fortnight).\\nFeeling very tense in public. This happens to me nearly every single time. I’m excited about going out, I’m confident in myself, I feel very casual. And then I step into a crowded place, or somewhere with a lot of people, and my anxiety begins. The constant fidgeting with anything so I don’t look awkward while I’m waiting in this line. The dreadful feeling that comes when I feel like everyone around me is so attractive, confident and approachable, and I’m the ugly, small, awkward guy who everyone is probably staring at. The paranoia that wherever I am and whatever I’m doing, someone is watching me an thinking badly of me. This all builds up to a point where I feel so uncomfortable that I’m really desperate to leave and I feel like I might pass out.\\nThese are some of my experiences, but they might not be as severe as others who have higher levels of social anxiety.\\nAs I was typing this, I kept saying to myself “Why even bother, no-one cares, no-one’s going to read it” “You’re just making a fool of yourself”, but I’ve decided that this will at least help a few people, there is nothing to be ashamed of as many other people experience the same thing as me, and Quora is the most loving, caring and accepting community I’ve ever been apart of.\\n:)</td>\n",

You are afraid you won’t be capable of conversing ‘correctly’ in that people won’t talk behind your back once you leave the room or get a bad impression out of you.\\nI have been suffering from social anxiety for years and it really sucks. One time I tried to overcome this by becoming a volunteer in some cross-cultural events in college but after the first committe meeting I got a full blown panic attack. Being around these people during a two-hour meeting was so taxing and emotionally drained me that I phoned my friend (who was a volunteer as well) and told her I wanted to quit. I felt like everyone was judging me the entire time although they seemed to ignore me. But at the same time I knew that they ignored me because I didn’t stand out in the crowd, I was plain and uninteresting and this resulted in feeling of rejection in me.

Additionally, self-help techniques such as practicing relaxation exercises, challenging negative thoughts, and gradually facing feared social situations can complement professional treatment and enhance long-term outcomes.

There are other, more specialized medications for treating someone with social anxiety disorder, however, I've had it for about 6 or 7 years now and I was taking Sertraline (an anti-depressant) and it helped my social anxiety by keeping my mind calm when I was in social situations, instead of my thoughts racing in a million different directions at once.\\nOne thing that has nearly eradicated my social anxiety (though not all the way) is forcing myself out of my comfort zone. I suffer from PTSD which, as a result, has caused my social anxiety disorder (since my PTSD is complex PTSD due to 7 years of horrendous bullying). Once I was out of that trigger situation, I was able to focus more on what truly exacerbated my social anxiety... The answer was obviously social situations and being put on spotlight when I'm in these social settings. So, I made an impulsive decision, and decided to force myself to get a job in retail, working the floor as a salesperson. While I almost didn't show up for my first day, since my anxiety about this job was so bad, I ended up forcing myself out of the car and into the building and I'll tell you, it was one of the absolute best decisions I have ever had to make. Now when I go into social situations, while I still have anxiety about the situation, I tell myself that if retail couldn't kill me, than neither will this.\\nForcing myself into social situations and outside of my comfort zone worked wonders!

So the only way to conquer it is to paradoxically expose yourself to more of these anxiety-ridden situations (this is the basis of cognitive behavioral therapy), because that’s the only way to reduce your anxiety in the long run.\\nCrazy, huh?\\nI used to have pretty bad social anxiety. In literature class (my favorite class in high school), I couldn’t speak up during socratic seminars, and if I did, I probably spoke a total of 15 seconds because I was so nervous.\\nAnd dating? Forget it.\\nThe more I liked you, the more I probably ignored you and never talked to you because my whole body would start heating up and my mouth would open but no words would come out.\\nSo in college, I decided to change.\\nI decided to address this problem because I’m a business major, I love talking to people, and I didn’t want social anxiety to get in my way.\\nSo I did a combination of things: going to group therapy, joining student orgs and actually trying to have a conversation with people, saying “yes” more to random hangouts, going on dates (including using dating apps), and in general having more conversations with people everywhere - on ubers, in class, with my professors, with random people I meet etc.\\nAnd right now, I’m pretty surprised, because it worked.\\nI realized that most of it is just in your head. You think, if I do this it’ll be awkward, or what if they think I’m so weird? Chances are, no one remembers and if they do, they don’t really care.\\nEveryone’s weird. Everyone’s human. It’s okay to take a risk, laugh at yourself if you make a mistake, and just put yourself out there.\\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s still hard for me and when I speak with people in authority or crushes, I definitely still get anxious. But these days, I’m often pleasantly surprised when I have a completely comfortable interaction with a stranger, or when I raise my hand in class and even feel a little bit confident.\\nSo you can definitely conquer social anxiety without medication.

       "0     You avoid getting out of your room until the guests leave. And your parents wonder how they brought up such a disrespectful brat.\\nYou are sitting in a crowded room with no one giving a crap about you. But in your head, all you can think of is that the spotlight is on you and you are being judged left and right.\\nYou walk with your head held down. You are too scared to meet the eyes.\\nPublic speaking is scarier than a suicide dive off the Burj Khalifa.\\nA couple of hours at a party among strangers is more exhausting than a round trip around the earth twice.\\nIf you had to choose between death and approaching your crush, you would voluntarily dig a grave and bury yourself in it.\\nYour phone is vital. You can pretend to be doing something on it if you happen to be sitting alone in a crowded room.\\nYou are petrified of walking into a room full of people. And if you are made to stand in front of them, your heart forgets it has to pump blood and soon you find yourself losing your balance and in the worst case, falling down unconscious.\\nYou rehearse “hello” with every ring your phone makes while calling someone.\\nYou don’t like people calling you. And you have made the “sorry mate, I was asleep” excuse so many times that a few people think you are in a perpetual state of sleep when you aren’t with them.\\nYou try and pretend to be normal while talking to someone from the opposite sex but one can hear your galloping heartbeats even from Pluto.\\nWinning a Nobel Prize seems easier than small talks.\\n98% of people who see you everyday have never heard your voice.\\nYour dream vacation is the one you spend locked inside your room surfing the internet.\\nA lot of people unfamiliar with social anxiety might think the above symptoms relate well with “shyness”. Well, they are poles apart. Shyness is a trait, social anxiety is a struggle.\\n“Shyness” is a part and parcel of a shy person. That is how they are. They accept it and learn to live with it eventually. Some break out of their shells as they grow older. Social Anxiety on the other hand is different. It is not a character trait of a person. It is picked up by the person along the journey of life. A person just can’t decide one morning that he or she wouldn’t be anxious anymore. It just doesn’t work that way. Social Anxiety is a disorder. And it takes a lot away from a person. Other answers on this thread do more justice to the question.\\nSocial Anxiety is different from “introversion”. Introversion is your way while social anxiety gets in your way. You learn to live with introversion at some point of your life, you might even transition to an ambivert or an extrovert, but with social anxiety, you know there is something wrong with you. And unfortunately, the mainstream barely relates with you. It’s worthless sharing your concerns with someone. The most enlightening and frequent advise I ever got from people was “stop caring”. Yeah, as if there is a switch that turns caring off or on.\\nNever ask a socially anxious person why they are this way. They have been looking for an answer to this question all their lives.\\nEdit: Due to the amount of attention this answer garnered, I earned a lot of non-Indian followers overtime, some of them indulged in psychiatric study, some of them victims of social anxiety who could relate and some who felt I write on this topic often.\\nBut I would request the readers to not follow me on this answer alone. My answers are strictly India centric, relating more to academic examinations in India, stuff that you will hardly relate to. I appreciate the appreciation. Thank you so much!\\nIt will be four years of me writing this answer in a few months. Things have been better for me. Of course, it is hard to forget how I was robbed off a normal life, about the fun I missed out on, about how I was never the one to approach the friends I have today, all thanks to social anxiety. It illusion-ed me into believing that I was an introvert when I am more of an ambivert. I like being with people, chilling out with them, having fun. I like attention. But thanks to social anxiety, I have always been an outcaste. I am still not comfortable in my own skin. I still carry those deep insecurities 24*7. But guess what, over time it has only gotten better. And if I compare myself to when I had written this, I’d barely be able to recognize myself. Felt like adding this edit for all the depressed, anxious teenagers. There is light at the end of the tunnel. It won’t always be this way. Never be afraid to seek help.   \n",

A person who suffers from social anxiety experienced this every day.\\nMost people's cannot understand our condition.\\nOur whole life is in panic. When our phone rings we are in a panic when our door knocked we are in a panic.\\nFear of public speaking makes us more underconfident and worsen our situation.\\nPeople find us egoistic, but they will never understand our behaviour.\\nWe prefer to live alone, we do want to go outside without a reason, we are not interested in parties, family gatherings etc.\\nSilence and solitude is our comfort\\nFear of judgement restricts us to make conversation with new people\\nWe are very uncomfortable in public and crowded places.\\nWe always panic about the happening of certain as well as uncertain events.\\nWe have no fear of death because we are already exhausted.\\nWe prefer to head down while walking on the streets to avoid eye contact with strangers.\\nWe avoid conversations with guests and relatives.\\nWhen a guest reaches our home, we are pretending to be asleep until they leave our home.\\nWe face problems in sleeping (affected with both insomnia and hypersomnia).\\nWe continuously think about unexpected events.\\nWe don't feel comfortable in the day, we feel comfortable at night.\\nThey are many unseen wounds in our body and brain. That can never be healed, that can never be diagnosed completely.\\nWe don't have the power to tolerate useless conversations and unproductive opinions from others.\\nIn public places, We always feel that people are watching us, judging us based on our looks, dressing sense and behaviour.\\nAll-day, every day, life is like this. Fear. Apprehension. Avoidance. Pain. Anxiety about what you said. Fear that you said something wrong. Worry about others' disapproval. Afraid of rejection, of not fitting in. Anxious to enter a conversation, afraid you'll have nothing to talk about. Hiding what's wrong with you deep inside, putting up a defensive wall to protect your \"secret\". You are undergoing the daily, chronic trouble of living with this mental disorder we call social anxiety disorder.\\nVery few people understand the agonizing and traumatic depth of social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety makes people go inside themselves and try to \"protect\" this secret. Most people with social anxiety disorder try to hide it from others, especially from family and loved ones. There is fear that family members may find out they suffer from social anxiety, and then view them differently or outright reject them. This is rarely true, but the fear of this happening makes many people with social anxiety stay in their dark closet.\\nIf you relate with this, then please do upvote on this answer\\nCheers!   \n",

I have a moderate level of social anxiety (not so severe that I have actual physical panic attacks) but these are some examples of what I’m dealing with.\\nPushing people away. Friends, relatives, acquaintances, it’s hard to try and keep contact with them. As soon as I feel like I’m getting close with someone or we’re actually making conversation, I can’t help but feel as if I annoying the other person and they don’t actually wanna be near me, even when they show strong signs that they really like me.\\nFeeling like you don’t fit in to any group. You’re in class, and the teacher announces an activity for the class to do. Nothing really alarming yet, until she mentions the word “groups”. I say to myself “Oh great, now I’m just going to annoy more people, no-one even wants me in there group”, and when I join the group, it affects me as it makes me feel bad about myself and I become more silent.\\nHaving a boring, bordered life. My normal routine just consists of waking up, eating, going to school, using my phone and laptop, and sleeping. That’s it. I always feel like I have a lot of adrenaline in me and I feel like going out somewhere, but then my anxiety kicks in, telling me “who would want to go with you anyways” and “everyone out there is going to look at you and how ugly you are”. So I just stay at home all the time (other than going school) and I rarely go outside (only about once a fortnight).\\nFeeling very tense in public. This happens to me nearly every single time. I’m excited about going out, I’m confident in myself, I feel very casual. And then I step into a crowded place, or somewhere with a lot of people, and my anxiety begins. The constant fidgeting with anything so I don’t look awkward while I’m waiting in this line. The dreadful feeling that comes when I feel like everyone around me is so attractive, confident and approachable, and I’m the ugly, small, awkward guy who everyone is probably staring at. The paranoia that wherever I am and whatever I’m doing, someone is watching me an thinking badly of me. This all builds up to a point where I feel so uncomfortable that I’m really desperate to leave and I feel like I might pass out.\\nThese are some of my experiences, but they might not be as severe as others who have higher levels of social anxiety.\\nAs I was typing this, I kept saying to myself “Why even bother, no-one cares, no-one’s going to read it” “You’re just making a fool of yourself”, but I’ve decided that this will at least help a few people, there is nothing to be ashamed of as many other people experience the same thing as me, and Quora is the most loving, caring and accepting community I’ve ever been apart of.\\n:)   \n",

It interferes with almost every single little thing I do, from something as simple as making a phone call to ordering food from a restaurant.\\nHaving a class discussion:\\nTeacher: “Okay, class. Today we’re going to debate on the topic of the grading system…”\\nMe: Ooh, I have something to say! Maybe I should try speaking up for once—\\nMy brain: Are you serious? Do you really think anyone wants to hear your useless opinion? Just shut your mouth for the sake of all your classmates, please.\\nTeacher: “(My name), you look like you want to say something. Do you have any input on the subject?”\\nMe: *fidgeting* “Um…no, not really.”\\nTeacher: “Oh, alright then.” *calls on someone else*\\nMy brain: You fucking idiot! You could have said something, anything.\\nMe: *heart racing in surprise* But…you just told me to not say anything…\\nMy brain: Yeah, that was only because you weren’t required to talk, you worthless piece of shit. Now everyone in this class knows how stupid you are.\\nAsking for help:\\nMe: Man, I really don’t understand anything that’s going on in this lesson. Maybe I should ask for help. *raises hand tentatively*\\nMy brain: Put your hand down, you idiot. Now the teacher’s going to know how stupid you are.\\nMe: *immediately puts hand down in shame*\\nHaving lunch at school:\\nMe: *stomach growls* Man, I’m so hungry. I didn’t eat any breakfast this morning. I should get some lunch.\\nMy brain: But what if you trip and fall while carrying the tray? What if you mess up typing in your student ID number and the lunch lady gets mad? What if you spill something all over your clothes and you have to walk around with your clothes stained all day?\\nMe: *Sigh* Well I guess I should go yet another day without eating then…\\nPresenting a project:\\nMe: *can’t even think straight, heart pounding out of my chest, knees shaking* shitshitshitshitshitshitican’tdothisican’tdothis\\nMy brain: Just get it over with, you dumbass. It’s not like you’re going to get a good grade anyway.\\nI don’t even know if I’ll post this answer. I’ve never told anyone this before because I am fully aware of how irrational and childish my thoughts are, but I’m so tired of keeping it to myself 24/7. It’s made it especially hard to make any friends, and it prevents me from getting any closer to the few friends I do have. I thought it would go away as I grew older, but it’s only gotten progressively worse throughout the years, to the point where I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore.\\nI have taken several tests online and they have all had the same results. I’ve been told by a professional that I do indeed have diagnosable anxiety disorder, and yet my parents still refuse to get me the help I need.\\nFuck it. I’m going to post in anonymously. I’m tired of feeling so weak and useless and not being able to tell anyone what my daily struggles are, so I might as well say it on a random website.   \n",

It sometimes gets to the point where you are scared to start or engage in a normal human interaction. Your brain and emotions are filled with the ‘what ifs’ questions. You are afraid you won’t be capable of conversing ‘correctly’ in that people won’t talk behind your back once you leave the room or get a bad impression out of you.\\nI have been suffering from social anxiety for years and it really sucks. One time I tried to overcome this by becoming a volunteer in some cross-cultural events in college but after the first committe meeting I got a full blown panic attack. Being around these people during a two-hour meeting was so taxing and emotionally drained me that I phoned my friend (who was a volunteer as well) and told her I wanted to quit. I felt like everyone was judging me the entire time although they seemed to ignore me. But at the same time I knew that they ignored me because I didn’t stand out in the crowd, I was plain and uninteresting and this resulted in feeling of rejection in me. The worst thing is that I knew this probably wasn’t true and just something I made up in my mind but I cannot tell.\\nSocial anxiety makes me hide upstairs when relatives come to visit during a holiday.\\nSocial anxiety makes me turn down job interviews because the anticipation of being in a room of strangers who will judge me for a few minutes overwhelms me to the point I lose my appetite and become sleep-deprived\\nSocial anxiety makes me become too insecure and worried to show up in a high school reunions for years\\nSocial anxiety makes me have second thoughts when I want to complaint about my food at a restaurant, my wrong orders\\nSocial anxiety make me get up early in the morning, pray to God intensely that I would have the strength of going through the day being around people and talking to them without having a mental breakdown\\nI have this extreme fear that i would embarass myself when I open my mouth. It feels like once I am around people, my brain acts on itself and I am just watching as I do or speak things. Later, I would replay everything in my mind and overthink everything. I hate looking stupid just because my mind goes into overdrive when I am in a group hangout.\\nI always feel like I barely vibe with anyone, but I realize it’s my anxiety telling me to steer clear from everyone because I am worried too much about how my actions and words would come off to people.\\nSocial anxiety sucks. And I am still trying to beat it. I really want to defeat it. My worst fear is that I would become so used to being alone in my room that I wouldn’t be capable of carrying out basic human interaction.\\nEdit: I am surprised by the amount of people who said they can relate to this.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring, is considered the gold standard for treating social anxiety. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or benzodiazepines may also be prescribed to alleviate symptoms and reduce anxiety levels. Additionally, self-help techniques such as practicing relaxation exercises, challenging negative thoughts, and gradually facing feared social situations can complement professional treatment and enhance long-term outcomes.

There are other, more specialized medications for treating someone with social anxiety disorder, however, I've had it for about 6 or 7 years now and I was taking Sertraline (an anti-depressant) and it helped my social anxiety by keeping my mind calm when I was in social situations, instead of my thoughts racing in a million different directions at once.\\nOne thing that has nearly eradicated my social anxiety (though not all the way) is forcing myself out of my comfort zone. I suffer from PTSD which, as a result, has caused my social anxiety disorder (since my PTSD is complex PTSD due to 7 years of horrendous bullying). Once I was out of that trigger situation, I was able to focus more on what truly exacerbated my social anxiety... The answer was obviously social situations and being put on spotlight when I'm in these social settings. So, I made an impulsive decision, and decided to force myself to get a job in retail, working the floor as a salesperson. While I almost didn't show up for my first day, since my anxiety about this job was so bad, I ended up forcing myself out of the car and into the building and I'll tell you, it was one of the absolute best decisions I have ever had to make. Now when I go into social situations, while I still have anxiety about the situation, I tell myself that if retail couldn't kill me, than neither will this.\\nForcing myself into social situations and outside of my comfort zone worked wonders! It worked so much better than any medication possibly could!!!!\\nHope this helps, even if it's just a little! :)   \n",

So the only way to conquer it is to paradoxically expose yourself to more of these anxiety-ridden situations (this is the basis of cognitive behavioral therapy), because that’s the only way to reduce your anxiety in the long run.\\nCrazy, huh?\\nI used to have pretty bad social anxiety. In literature class (my favorite class in high school), I couldn’t speak up during socratic seminars, and if I did, I probably spoke a total of 15 seconds because I was so nervous.\\nAnd dating? Forget it.\\nThe more I liked you, the more I probably ignored you and never talked to you because my whole body would start heating up and my mouth would open but no words would come out.\\nSo in college, I decided to change.\\nI decided to address this problem because I’m a business major, I love talking to people, and I didn’t want social anxiety to get in my way.\\nSo I did a combination of things: going to group therapy, joining student orgs and actually trying to have a conversation with people, saying “yes” more to random hangouts, going on dates (including using dating apps), and in general having more conversations with people everywhere - on ubers, in class, with my professors, with random people I meet etc.\\nAnd right now, I’m pretty surprised, because it worked.\\nI realized that most of it is just in your head. You think, if I do this it’ll be awkward, or what if they think I’m so weird? Chances are, no one remembers and if they do, they don’t really care.\\nEveryone’s weird. Everyone’s human. It’s okay to take a risk, laugh at yourself if you make a mistake, and just put yourself out there.\\nDon’t get me wrong. It’s still hard for me and when I speak with people in authority or crushes, I definitely still get anxious. But these days, I’m often pleasantly surprised when I have a completely comfortable interaction with a stranger, or when I raise my hand in class and even feel a little bit confident.\\nSo you can definitely conquer social anxiety without medication. It’s been a long journey but it gets better the more you expose yourself, trust me.   \n",

I recognize and believe that pwPDs should be treated with compassion and it is ableist to hold stigma toward these diagnoses. Yet I can’t extend that to myself. \\n\\nI am very worried that I have either BPD or vulnerable NPD (or traits of one or both). I feel this makes me “bad” and I’ll never be cured of my badness. I feel emotions like shame very strongly, almost in a physical way. I get stuck in it quite frequently and find it difficult to function in life. I don’t take care of myself and lay in bed and cry and think very negatively. I also think I don’t deserve to be around anyone even though I desperately want to, and I know it’s not rational.\\n\\nI’ve done bad things in my past. I’ve been told I have no empathy. I always thought I did but then I became aware - empathy really is limited in me. And that scares me. And I’m worried it only scares me because I’m simply worried about how other people may perceive me as “bad” if they knew.\\nI’m so internally self-obsessed. I used to think I had interests and hobbies, but it was always validation-seeking. And now that I’m aware and collapsed, I have nothing that I enjoy and life feels scary, empty and it’s all my own fault.\\n\\nI thought I was “just” depressed and anxious (general/social) since adolescence. I almost wore it like a badge of honor in a fucked up way. I had many narcissistic traits as a teen, like obsessively needing to be in National Honor Society to be one of the “smart kids”. It was all for appearances. I’m realizing nearly everything about me has always been for appearances, trying to get validation and attention. Constantly envious of my siblings and entitled and demanding of everyone around me. \\n\\nAs an adult now well past my twenties, I am constantly stuck in a victim mentality about my own problems. And I ruminate perpetually even though I try not to. It’s like I just can’t get out.\\n\\nI met a loving partner a little over a year ago on a dating app. We got into a relationship and they began living with me. They are so kind, genuinely empathetic, and compassionate to everyone. Total opposite of me in those things. I am so envious of them. I envy their job, their competence, their ability to make and keep and enjoy true close friends. Their ability to truly love. I’m afraid I can’t truly love. I feel stuck in a brain I don’t want to be in. \\n\\nMy partner was and has been very supportive of me. Driving me to appointments, making me food, just being a kind presence. But over time, my mental health issues are wearing them down and we are growing distant and disconnected. I am scared our relationship will end. It scares me to depths I thought I’d never reach. I feel physically sick sometimes. \\n\\nI feel I have to avoid them until I can regulate myself, because otherwise I cry and rant about my problems and end up apologizing. Sometimes I end up begging them not to leave and hugging them pretty much begging for comfort. They at this point feel more like a caretaker than a romantic partner. I want to be a good partner for them. They said they feel unwanted due to our disconnection and lack of intimacy. I want to give them these things. But I just feel so awful all the time.\\n\\nI have a therapist I’ve been speaking to for over a year, every week. But I’m afraid he doesn’t really know me and maybe I’ve somehow manipulated him into thinking I’m not a narcissist or bad person (I know the two are not actually synonymous, but I can’t feel that for myself).\\n\\nI’ve even done ketamine therapy, comprehensive DBT, and so many therapies and medications of all types over the years. I’m currently trying the antidepressant Auvelity. I listen to audiobooks about self-compassion and acceptance and yet I still hate myself. I compare myself to everyone at all times. I am so internally judgmental and mean toward others. I’m losing hope that I’ll ever feel better. I’m scared I just won’t be able to have a true healthy relationship. And through it all, I continue to just be self-focused and self-obsessed. I’m so scared and sad and it feels like it will never end.\\n\\nA part of me wants to believe I’m “good” and am simply just worried I have a PD, instead of actually having one. But I am waking up to the truly dysfunctional patterns I’ve exhibited throughout my life. And I fear it is all my own fault and I fear my sense of self is fake. I am so envious of others, it’s painful to be around them. I just want my partner to love me and be with me, yet I can’t truly give that to him even though I want to.\\n\\nAgain, I realize the “good/bad” rigid dichotomy I speak of is false. I do not with to cause harm but I am expressing how I feel about myself. I continue to see my therapist and try medication (I was stubborn on this due to being on psychiatric drugs from 13 to 25). I also found a clinical psychologist who does assessment and works with personality disorders in my area. I am so scared and the emotions feel overwhelming. It is very difficult to function. \\n\\nAll in all, anyone going through something similar at the moment? Does anyone have any support or advice or resources to handle these things?\\n\\nThank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My stepdaughter is only 12 years now, so I understand she’d be categorized as having Conduct Disorder but this group seems more knowledgable than others. \\n\\nAnyways I’ve been in her life since she was 6 months old. Her mother shows classic narsastic signs and has made coparenting very difficult. The mother and daughter moved out of state when the daughter was 5. We have the standard visitation of a week for Christmas and spring break and almost if the summer. \\n\\nMy husband and I recently started discussing her behavior and demeanor when he said he’s worried there’s something very abnormal/wrong with her. I then told him my parents recently shared the same thought with me and actually encouraged me to not leave her alone with our 4 year old son. I don’t disagree with this. I didn’t think anyone else had this opinion besides me. We talked to my husband’s parents who also admitted the same feelings. So in short, we (6 adults who spend the most time with her) had all individually noticed something was different but just now came forward with the thought and we’ve all noticed problematic behavior since she was a toddler.\\n\\nWe want her to have the best life she can. I understand therapy is best starting point. But we know her mother will deny there’s anything amiss her her daughter (this has been proven time and again). \\n\\n\\nWe think she might have it because she fits all of the standard set of signs/symptoms that we found excluding being violent until I ran across some research paper saying females and males tend to show different forms of violence. Males tend to be more physically aggressive as females tend to be more emotionally aggressive. (It honestly made me think of a Louis C.K. stand up in which the basis was when seeking revenge men will beat the crap out of you while women will ruin your entire life.) After reading that it occurred to me she tends to have a complete shit attitude during any family outing or event I plan for us, especially for my birthday, to the point that I get pissed and want to leave. \\n\\nSo now she’s showing all the signs and as her non-custodial parents we are lost as to how to move forward to make sure she thrives as a adult as she’s not doing so great at thriving as a kid currently. Is there any advice you can give? Any insight to your behavior or thoughts as a teen? Any bit of info that we can use to help her navigate this from half a country away? \\n\\nAlso, as someone who doesn’t have this disorder, I’m very thankful for all you on here and those who choose to respond.</td>\n",

We broke up because he was using me and I took it very badly. \\n\\nThis question is about morality without emotions. \\n\\nThere were many qualities he had that I found very attractive and they are actually qualities that I aspire to develop more. Such as having clear goals, creating and pursuing a strategy to achieve them, great people skills, not letting emotions rule his actions, logical thinking, self confidence etc.\\n\\nBut the problem for me was always that he seemed to have no moral code, no sense of internal boundary as to when he had taken enough beyond a signal from the other person that it made them like him less and therefore risked not sticking around to keep giving him what he wants. And then he'd course correct somewhat reactively. \\n\\nIt's made me think about the fact that although I can rationalise my morality, a lot of it probably does rest on the feeling of empathy. And I'm wondering, since you people feel less or no emotion, do you believe in such a thing as morality, do you have a moral system that is based on rationality? Or are you just adjusting to 'seem to fit in with' what you see as the social norms, or expectations of people you get close to, out of convenience or to get something you want? \\n\\nHow do you temper your actions? This is something I've wondered for a while. Would you stop at nothing to get to your goal as long as you don't get into trouble for it or is there something internal that would stop you from 'going too far' and how do you rationalise that?\\n\\nI'm very interested in understanding this more from both a sociological and philosophical perspective.</td>\n",

All the while he was copying me, a 20 year old, and claiming to be a victim of someone half his age. \\n\\nI dealt with personality disordered drug and alcohol addicts at work, who copied what I did or wore, while projecting their shit onto me. When I tried to buy shoes, certain staff members wouldn't let me buy the shoes I wanted, and gave me recommendations for shoes that would make me look like I was mentally ill- because it's the shoes that they wore. \\n\\nFuck everyone.    \n",

\\n\\nEx: A posted video about how a family member should do anything to protect their child against sexual predation when they have been accused of the same thing recently, by someone trying to protect their own child from something sexual that was said about their kid? \\n\\nWhat type of person would do this? It seems very bizarre.   \n",

       "4     I have been worried about having a cluster B personality disorder for quite some time. I recognize and believe that pwPDs should be treated with compassion and it is ableist to hold stigma toward these diagnoses. Yet I can’t extend that to myself. \\n\\nI am very worried that I have either BPD or vulnerable NPD (or traits of one or both). I feel this makes me “bad” and I’ll never be cured of my badness. I feel emotions like shame very strongly, almost in a physical way. I get stuck in it quite frequently and find it difficult to function in life. I don’t take care of myself and lay in bed and cry and think very negatively. I also think I don’t deserve to be around anyone even though I desperately want to, and I know it’s not rational.\\n\\nI’ve done bad things in my past. I’ve been told I have no empathy. I always thought I did but then I became aware - empathy really is limited in me. And that scares me. And I’m worried it only scares me because I’m simply worried about how other people may perceive me as “bad” if they knew.\\nI’m so internally self-obsessed. I used to think I had interests and hobbies, but it was always validation-seeking. And now that I’m aware and collapsed, I have nothing that I enjoy and life feels scary, empty and it’s all my own fault.\\n\\nI thought I was “just” depressed and anxious (general/social) since adolescence. I almost wore it like a badge of honor in a fucked up way. I had many narcissistic traits as a teen, like obsessively needing to be in National Honor Society to be one of the “smart kids”. It was all for appearances. I’m realizing nearly everything about me has always been for appearances, trying to get validation and attention. Constantly envious of my siblings and entitled and demanding of everyone around me. \\n\\nAs an adult now well past my twenties, I am constantly stuck in a victim mentality about my own problems. And I ruminate perpetually even though I try not to. It’s like I just can’t get out.\\n\\nI met a loving partner a little over a year ago on a dating app. We got into a relationship and they began living with me. They are so kind, genuinely empathetic, and compassionate to everyone. Total opposite of me in those things. I am so envious of them. I envy their job, their competence, their ability to make and keep and enjoy true close friends. Their ability to truly love. I’m afraid I can’t truly love. I feel stuck in a brain I don’t want to be in. \\n\\nMy partner was and has been very supportive of me. Driving me to appointments, making me food, just being a kind presence. But over time, my mental health issues are wearing them down and we are growing distant and disconnected. I am scared our relationship will end. It scares me to depths I thought I’d never reach. I feel physically sick sometimes. \\n\\nI feel I have to avoid them until I can regulate myself, because otherwise I cry and rant about my problems and end up apologizing. Sometimes I end up begging them not to leave and hugging them pretty much begging for comfort. They at this point feel more like a caretaker than a romantic partner. I want to be a good partner for them. They said they feel unwanted due to our disconnection and lack of intimacy. I want to give them these things. But I just feel so awful all the time.\\n\\nI have a therapist I’ve been speaking to for over a year, every week. But I’m afraid he doesn’t really know me and maybe I’ve somehow manipulated him into thinking I’m not a narcissist or bad person (I know the two are not actually synonymous, but I can’t feel that for myself).\\n\\nI’ve even done ketamine therapy, comprehensive DBT, and so many therapies and medications of all types over the years. I’m currently trying the antidepressant Auvelity. I listen to audiobooks about self-compassion and acceptance and yet I still hate myself. I compare myself to everyone at all times. I am so internally judgmental and mean toward others. I’m losing hope that I’ll ever feel better. I’m scared I just won’t be able to have a true healthy relationship. And through it all, I continue to just be self-focused and self-obsessed. I’m so scared and sad and it feels like it will never end.\\n\\nA part of me wants to believe I’m “good” and am simply just worried I have a PD, instead of actually having one. But I am waking up to the truly dysfunctional patterns I’ve exhibited throughout my life. And I fear it is all my own fault and I fear my sense of self is fake. I am so envious of others, it’s painful to be around them. I just want my partner to love me and be with me, yet I can’t truly give that to him even though I want to.\\n\\nAgain, I realize the “good/bad” rigid dichotomy I speak of is false. I do not with to cause harm but I am expressing how I feel about myself. I continue to see my therapist and try medication (I was stubborn on this due to being on psychiatric drugs from 13 to 25). I also found a clinical psychologist who does assessment and works with personality disorders in my area. I am so scared and the emotions feel overwhelming. It is very difficult to function. \\n\\nAll in all, anyone going through something similar at the moment? Does anyone have any support or advice or resources to handle these things?\\n\\nThank you.   \n",

Her mother shows classic narsastic signs and has made coparenting very difficult. The mother and daughter moved out of state when the daughter was 5. We have the standard visitation of a week for Christmas and spring break and almost if the summer. \\n\\nMy husband and I recently started discussing her behavior and demeanor when he said he’s worried there’s something very abnormal/wrong with her. I then told him my parents recently shared the same thought with me and actually encouraged me to not leave her alone with our 4 year old son. I don’t disagree with this. I didn’t think anyone else had this opinion besides me. We talked to my husband’s parents who also admitted the same feelings. So in short, we (6 adults who spend the most time with her) had all individually noticed something was different but just now came forward with the thought and we’ve all noticed problematic behavior since she was a toddler.\\n\\nWe want her to have the best life she can. I understand therapy is best starting point. But we know her mother will deny there’s anything amiss her her daughter (this has been proven time and again). \\n\\n\\nWe think she might have it because she fits all of the standard set of signs/symptoms that we found excluding being violent until I ran across some research paper saying females and males tend to show different forms of violence. Males tend to be more physically aggressive as females tend to be more emotionally aggressive. (It honestly made me think of a Louis C.K. stand up in which the basis was when seeking revenge men will beat the crap out of you while women will ruin your entire life.) After reading that it occurred to me she tends to have a complete shit attitude during any family outing or event I plan for us, especially for my birthday, to the point that I get pissed and want to leave. \\n\\nSo now she’s showing all the signs and as her non-custodial parents we are lost as to how to move forward to make sure she thrives as a adult as she’s not doing so great at thriving as a kid currently. Is there any advice you can give? Any insight to your behavior or thoughts as a teen? Any bit of info that we can use to help her navigate this from half a country away? \\n\\nAlso, as someone who doesn’t have this disorder, I’m very thankful for all you on here and those who choose to respond.   \n",

I'm talking unconditionally loving someone. You want them to always be happy and feel sad when they aren't. You want what's best for them even if it isn't what you want/would like (them going to their dream college but it's far away from you for example). \\n\\nPersonally, love to me has much sympathy and compromise in it, but those who don't naturally feel much sympathy I think it'd be hard to be willing to compromise. \\n\\nI'm sorry if my question or wording comes across as mean or rude or insensitive, but I really am just curious and have no ill intent whatsoever. If misspoke please inform me but don't take my words as a personal attack.   \n",

We broke up because he was using me and I took it very badly. \\n\\nThis question is about morality without emotions. \\n\\nThere were many qualities he had that I found very attractive and they are actually qualities that I aspire to develop more. Such as having clear goals, creating and pursuing a strategy to achieve them, great people skills, not letting emotions rule his actions, logical thinking, self confidence etc.\\n\\nBut the problem for me was always that he seemed to have no moral code, no sense of internal boundary as to when he had taken enough beyond a signal from the other person that it made them like him less and therefore risked not sticking around to keep giving him what he wants. And then he'd course correct somewhat reactively. \\n\\nIt's made me think about the fact that although I can rationalise my morality, a lot of it probably does rest on the feeling of empathy. And I'm wondering, since you people feel less or no emotion, do you believe in such a thing as morality, do you have a moral system that is based on rationality? Or are you just adjusting to 'seem to fit in with' what you see as the social norms, or expectations of people you get close to, out of convenience or to get something you want? \\n\\nHow do you temper your actions? This is something I've wondered for a while. Would you stop at nothing to get to your goal as long as you don't get into trouble for it or is there something internal that would stop you from 'going too far' and how do you rationalise that?\\n\\nI'm very interested in understanding this more from both a sociological and philosophical perspective.   \n",

       "      <td>Well, just recently I underwent a lot of stress in my life. business was not doing well and expenses were mounting and to top it off I planned to take GMAT in order to get admission into college. Truth be told, this was the first time in my life that I was getting nothing done. I was gaining weight despite working out and it was pathetic.\\nSo here’s what I did to deal with stress -\\nTime Management: I started getting up early at around 6 AM. That's early from my standards since I sleep late . Maintained a schedule for meetings, gym and study which was difficult at first but it worked out well. Soon , I was able to get most of the work done that I aimed for and these short goals made a huge difference.\\nPositive Thinking and Spirituality: I was a person who would eat non veg everyday, drink alcohol on any day and I would never visit temple. Once, I gave in myself to god I felt uplifted. I cant explain what it is when you surrender to god but honestly, things become easy. It really helped me with my GMAT score ( more on that later). I started believing in god’s plan and started thinking about positive outcomes.\\nHealthy Lifestyle: I started eating home cooked food and absolutely avoided alcohol and caffeine.\\nShort Trips: After my first failed, instead of sulking and feeling depressed I went to Mussoorie to rejuvenate. Despite the disapproval of my parents, I went ahead as I knew I would have to slog even more after coming back and this short trip actually prepared me for the fight.\\nAfter months of stress ( 10 months to be precise) my handwork paid off.\\nArjun Goswami ✌️</td>\n",

       "      <td>Stress is a major killer, that’s why most of us avoid it as much as possible. However, stress is part of our lives and avoiding it is not really an option. But we can learn to manage it. The following are a few tips to help manage stress:\\n1. Start with more sleep. Lack of sleep is a major contributor to stress, including anxiety and depression.\\n2. Be more social. Humans are social beings and one of the ways to fight stress is by spending time with others.\\n3. Exercise. Exercise is a stress reliever and people who exercise frequently tend to be more confident, energetic and happy. You can start by going for a run or walking around the park every morning.\\n4. Do yoga or meditate. Yoga involves slow, gentle stretching, breathing and focusing on gentle movements. It is a great form of exercise and a great way to relax.\\n5. Pay attention to your surroundings. People who are in nature, especially those who live by the sea, have less stress and better overall health than people who live in the city.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Here are 5 ways to handle stress that put you in a good position - you can start today and make these changes to feel better:\\nGuard Your Attention. The things you pay attention to, will guide what you feel. If you don’t guard your attention, negativity is happy to take it! So, for example, if you are paying attention to the panicking news reports 24/7, attacking political rhetoric, social media comparisons, or toxic people in your life….expect feelings of panic, negativity and self-doubt to dominate your life. Pay attention to your family, your work, your pets, etc..and don’t allow negative things to dominate what you pay attention to.\\nEmpty Your Cup. Think of your mind as a cup that, over time, starts to fill with stressors. You dump a little in here (a negative remark), and a little in there (social media stressors), and before you know it…you are at your tipping point and can’t handle *one more thing!* Stressors stack up, and they layer on each other. When you keep your cup more empty, there is more room for you to handle the next thing that comes, so limit the things that fill that cup with stress. If you notice that certain things stress you out - the news, that social media app on your phone (not Quora of course), then maybe it’s time to cut them out for a while…\\nFocus On The Things You Can Control. You can’t control the outcome of an election, you can’t control what others think, and you can’t control what others do or say….but you *can* control yourself. Focusing on the things you *can’t* control is like banging your head against the wall. Use your focus to set you up for better things, and not just get “dragged into” negativity. Choose not to engage there! Choose to walk away from negativity or things that stress you out! Ask yourself when stressed, “Okay, what can you control here?” You can control if you vote (so do that!), you can control how you spend your time, and who you spend your time with or what you focus on. Make it the good stuff.\\nIncrease the Good Stuff. When life gets stressful, it’s important to increase the things that bring you happiness, relief, and joy. Spend extra time with your pet, give a loved one a call, or take a nice relaxing bath…it’s not *selfish* to take some time and take care of yourself. If you don’t, you can’t be at your best for anyone or anything else.\\nGet Help. Sometimes the stress if overwhelming, and you realize you need more. While some people hire me to deal with stressors around work or professional goals, you might need more help than that…maybe you need a therapist or psychiatrist because you know that you are struggling just to function, or feel impaired in your day-to-day life. There is no shame asking for help to deal with stress if you need it…you can save months if not *years* of struggle, and do something that gets you back on your game.\\nThe world is more stressful than ever…and a lot of the things that people have used to cope in the past, just aren’t available right now due to the pandemic.\\nThings like going out with friends, visiting family, going on vacation, hitting the gym, and maybe even just getting out of the house is something so many people just can’t do…\\nSo if you notice that you’re stressed, and it’s impacting your life - here are a few quick things anyone can do.\\nTry a few of these, and I’d love to know how they go!</td>\n",

Almost half of my overall grade was to come from that cumulative, 3-hour final exam.\\nI woke up around 6 (the final began at 8 and I wanted to do review for a while) and was immediately overcome with stress and anxiety. My heart was pounding, I couldn’t think clearly, and I was struggling to take deep breaths.\\nLuckily, I had a plan to combat my tension.\\nI have recently started to mediate for 10–15 minutes every day to relieve my stress. I open an app called Calm and listen to light rain showers while I focus solely on my breathing with my eyes closed. Stressors cause side effects like our hearts beating faster and cortisol being released—which clouds our thoughts.\\nI knew if I didn’t find a way to relax before my exam, I wouldn’t be able think clearly and would become even more stressed. Luckily, my quick meditation session this morning reduced my stressed and allowed me to think clearly again.\\nAs a result, I walked into the exam room confidently and actually performed better than I expected.\\nIn addition to meditation, I curb stress in a few other ways.\\nSelf-positivity. When I’m feeling anxious, I’ll hype myself up by being kind and positive to myself. It sounds weird but saying to myself “Let’s go, bro. You’re a f*cking beast. Let’s get this bread” over and over again mentally prepares me for whatever battle I’m about to face.\\nPlay. Make sure that you save some time to relax and pursue your hobbies. For example, I play Xbox with friends almost every night as a way to unwind and destress. Find your outlet(s).\\nIn conclusion, meditating and hyping myself up with positivity helps me combat stressful situations. Also, finding time to pursue my hobbies, relax, and even exercise and hang with friends is a great way to relieve stress for me.\\nYou can do it!\\n—KH</td>\n",

There you learn mindfulness meditation, Anulom Vilom Pranayama, and Surya Namaskar, etc. along with Yoga exercises.\\nAfter you have learned the same, continue doing the same at home, as it's benificial in overcoming stress and depression. I understand the Yoga classes have different batches of 1 hour each and every day during the learning phase, you will have to spare only 1 hour per day. Once you learn everything, at home you can devote 20 to 30 minutes for Yoga.\\nAll the best.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well many times its only in your head and the cause is maybe the habits you might’ve build up while you weren't studying. So now you're trying to break the habit, break the routine.\\nFirst thing is to note down in your mind that, it'll take time. Everything takes time. You won't start concentrating 700% right after reading this answer. But someday you will.\\nSo here is first thing to do, calm down.\\nThat's right, don't takr any stress and just calm down.\\nSecond, believe in the limitless human potential, in simple words, understand that you aren't inferior (If you think you are the dumbest person).\\nThird have a suble smile and lighten up your mood, things done in a rush won't help you, as I said before, it'll definitely take time. Anyons who says “Do this and concentrate for 899 hours” well thats 899% clickbait and they couldn't care less about you concentrating. Why am I saying this? Well because when you follow those things and trust me most of the time you will fail and end up feeling more bad about yourself. You lose the moment you doubt yourself. So its crucial to understand that it'll take time.\\nTake deep breaths, clear your mind and think of possibile distractions.\\nIt could me primarily be your phone, social media. So you might think, ok I need to delete every social media and turn off the phone. Nope wrong. Phone is a part of us now, it's like a body part, you can't expect to remove your kidney and be normal. Its the truth, the phone a part of you. Trying to cut it out is simply stupid because even though it has cons, it has way foo many pros. Now social media, I always find people telling to “ make a better version of yourself “ or “ to become next Bi Gates” delete your social media. Hell no. No. No. No.\\nSocial media is also a major part of our lives. The fact that you are giving it more importance is well, your fault. Social media is the place where everyone express themselves, we engage, we entertain ourselves. Our brain loves that. But we forget that anything in excess is toxic. Same way social media in excess is toxic. Just honestly try to cut down the time you spend on social media. When we use anything which entertain us, we stop thinking rationally. For example, you think of using quora for maybe 30 minutes but the clock hit 30 minutes and you are reading an amazing answer which will take maybe more 4 minutes, no harm. But after that four minutes, you end up engaging in other answers. So the key here is trying to become more conscious while doing things. Again there's no particular script to it. I can only say keep trying to become conscious and make rational decisions. Keep practicing, it's like learning to ride a bicycle. It just gets better with every try. Don't hate yourself just because you spent 60 millisecons more on a social media.\\nNow this will help you in getting resistant to distractions, well because you know what you have to do.\\nTo start with studying, start small. Maybe a page. Don't make learning the entire Bible your first goal. Start with a page, then more and more. Try concentrating on a page. If you find that hard, then well go more small. Concentrate on a single sentence. Believe that that's the sentence you want to understand for now. Try to visualize and think over what is written. Simply reading it in inattentive manner will get you nowhere. Remember learning a sentence which you have understood is million times easier than putting efforts in remembering it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Thanks for A2A.\\n.\\nLet me be clear with you.\\nFirst of all, stress and stress response is something natural, and it is part of one’s survival mechanism.\\nNobody can avoid it, no matter who one happens to be or what one does. But one can certainly learn how to minimize its effects on oneself by learning how to do it. It is call developing resilience.\\nSecondly, negative thinking and lack of concentration, especially on studies, are attitudinal and behavioral issues. Both can be tackled through proper training.\\nSo everything boils down to one simple fact — one can learn to handle all situations through proper training of mind and body and then progress further.\\nThe only question remains — Does anybody want to invest time and money to learn these important skills?\\nBoth my personal and professional experiences tell me that such people are rare to find, especially in the modern times, where everybody is looking for shortcuts and instant gratification at the click of a button of a mouse.\\nBut that doesn’t happen. Nature has it’s own way of doing things. One has to get in sync with the ways of nature and not otherwise.\\nNow coming to your question — HOW CAN I?\\nYou can certainly do it if you invest at least 3 months of your life in learning how to do it and at least 9 more months in practicing the things that you have learned, before it becomes your second nature.\\nNow answer the following questions and decide for yourself:\\nAre you ready to do it?\\nDo you have it in you to do it?\\nIf yes, find someone to learn it from and transform yourself for your better future.\\nOr not.\\nThat’s all.</td>\n",

Truth be told, this was the first time in my life that I was getting nothing done. I was gaining weight despite working out and it was pathetic.\\nSo here’s what I did to deal with stress -\\nTime Management: I started getting up early at around 6 AM. That's early from my standards since I sleep late . Maintained a schedule for meetings, gym and study which was difficult at first but it worked out well. Soon , I was able to get most of the work done that I aimed for and these short goals made a huge difference.\\nPositive Thinking and Spirituality: I was a person who would eat non veg everyday, drink alcohol on any day and I would never visit temple. Once, I gave in myself to god I felt uplifted. I cant explain what it is when you surrender to god but honestly, things become easy. It really helped me with my GMAT score ( more on that later). I started believing in god’s plan and started thinking about positive outcomes.\\nHealthy Lifestyle: I started eating home cooked food and absolutely avoided alcohol and caffeine.\\nShort Trips: After my first failed, instead of sulking and feeling depressed I went to Mussoorie to rejuvenate.

However, stress is part of our lives and avoiding it is not really an option. But we can learn to manage it. The following are a few tips to help manage stress:\\n1. Start with more sleep. Lack of sleep is a major contributor to stress, including anxiety and depression.\\n2. Be more social. Humans are social beings and one of the ways to fight stress is by spending time with others.\\n3. Exercise. Exercise is a stress reliever and people who exercise frequently tend to be more confident, energetic and happy. You can start by going for a run or walking around the park every morning.\\n4. Do yoga or meditate. Yoga involves slow, gentle stretching, breathing and focusing on gentle movements. It is a great form of exercise and a great way to relax.\\n5. Pay attention to your surroundings. People who are in nature, especially those who live by the sea, have less stress and better overall health than people who live in the city.   \n",

The things you pay attention to, will guide what you feel. If you don’t guard your attention, negativity is happy to take it! So, for example, if you are paying attention to the panicking news reports 24/7, attacking political rhetoric, social media comparisons, or toxic people in your life….expect feelings of panic, negativity and self-doubt to dominate your life. Pay attention to your family, your work, your pets, etc..and don’t allow negative things to dominate what you pay attention to.\\nEmpty Your Cup. Think of your mind as a cup that, over time, starts to fill with stressors. You dump a little in here (a negative remark), and a little in there (social media stressors), and before you know it…you are at your tipping point and can’t handle *one more thing!* Stressors stack up, and they layer on each other. When you keep your cup more empty, there is more room for you to handle the next thing that comes, so limit the things that fill that cup with stress. If you notice that certain things stress you out - the news, that social media app on your phone (not Quora of course), then maybe it’s time to cut them out for a while…\\nFocus On The Things You Can Control. You can’t control the outcome of an election, you can’t control what others think, and you can’t control what others do or say….but you *can* control yourself. Focusing on the things you *can’t* control is like banging your head against the wall. Use your focus to set you up for better things, and not just get “dragged into” negativity. Choose not to engage there! Choose to walk away from negativity or things that stress you out! Ask yourself when stressed, “Okay, what can you control here?” You can control if you vote (so do that!), you can control how you spend your time, and who you spend your time with or what you focus on. Make it the good stuff.\\nIncrease the Good Stuff. When life gets stressful, it’s important to increase the things that bring you happiness, relief, and joy. Spend extra time with your pet, give a loved one a call, or take a nice relaxing bath…it’s not *selfish* to take some time and take care of yourself. If you don’t, you can’t be at your best for anyone or anything else.\\nGet Help. Sometimes the stress if overwhelming, and you realize you need more. While some people hire me to deal with stressors around work or professional goals, you might need more help than that…maybe you need a therapist or psychiatrist because you know that you are struggling just to function, or feel impaired in your day-to-day life. There is no shame asking for help to deal with stress if you need it…you can save months if not *years* of struggle, and do something that gets you back on your game.\\nThe world is more stressful than ever…and a lot of the things that people have used to cope in the past, just aren’t available right now due to the pandemic.\\nThings like going out with friends, visiting family, going on vacation, hitting the gym, and maybe even just getting out of the house is something so many people just can’t do…\\nSo if you notice that you’re stressed, and it’s impacting your life - here are a few quick things anyone can do.\\nTry a few of these, and I’d love to know how they go!   \n",

Almost half of my overall grade was to come from that cumulative, 3-hour final exam.\\nI woke up around 6 (the final began at 8 and I wanted to do review for a while) and was immediately overcome with stress and anxiety. My heart was pounding, I couldn’t think clearly, and I was struggling to take deep breaths.\\nLuckily, I had a plan to combat my tension.\\nI have recently started to mediate for 10–15 minutes every day to relieve my stress. I open an app called Calm and listen to light rain showers while I focus solely on my breathing with my eyes closed. Stressors cause side effects like our hearts beating faster and cortisol being released—which clouds our thoughts.\\nI knew if I didn’t find a way to relax before my exam, I wouldn’t be able think clearly and would become even more stressed. Luckily, my quick meditation session this morning reduced my stressed and allowed me to think clearly again.\\nAs a result, I walked into the exam room confidently and actually performed better than I expected.\\nIn addition to meditation, I curb stress in a few other ways.\\nSelf-positivity. When I’m feeling anxious, I’ll hype myself up by being kind and positive to myself. It sounds weird but saying to myself “Let’s go, bro. You’re a f*cking beast. Let’s get this bread” over and over again mentally prepares me for whatever battle I’m about to face.\\nPlay. Make sure that you save some time to relax and pursue your hobbies. For example, I play Xbox with friends almost every night as a way to unwind and destress. Find your outlet(s).\\nIn conclusion, meditating and hyping myself up with positivity helps me combat stressful situations. Also, finding time to pursue my hobbies, relax, and even exercise and hang with friends is a great way to relieve stress for me.\\nYou can do it!\\n—KH   \n",

But from your question it appears to me your condition is not severe.\\nIn such a case I would suggest you enroll yourself in any nearby Yoga teaching classes, under a qualified Yoga Guru. There you learn mindfulness meditation, Anulom Vilom Pranayama, and Surya Namaskar, etc. along with Yoga exercises.\\nAfter you have learned the same, continue doing the same at home, as it's benificial in overcoming stress and depression. I understand the Yoga classes have different batches of 1 hour each and every day during the learning phase, you will have to spare only 1 hour per day. Once you learn everything, at home you can devote 20 to 30 minutes for Yoga.\\nAll the best.   \n",

       "5191  Well many times its only in your head and the cause is maybe the habits you might’ve build up while you weren't studying. So now you're trying to break the habit, break the routine.\\nFirst thing is to note down in your mind that, it'll take time. Everything takes time. You won't start concentrating 700% right after reading this answer. But someday you will.\\nSo here is first thing to do, calm down.\\nThat's right, don't takr any stress and just calm down.\\nSecond, believe in the limitless human potential, in simple words, understand that you aren't inferior (If you think you are the dumbest person).\\nThird have a suble smile and lighten up your mood, things done in a rush won't help you, as I said before, it'll definitely take time. Anyons who says “Do this and concentrate for 899 hours” well thats 899% clickbait and they couldn't care less about you concentrating. Why am I saying this? Well because when you follow those things and trust me most of the time you will fail and end up feeling more bad about yourself. You lose the moment you doubt yourself. So its crucial to understand that it'll take time.\\nTake deep breaths, clear your mind and think of possibile distractions.\\nIt could me primarily be your phone, social media. So you might think, ok I need to delete every social media and turn off the phone. Nope wrong. Phone is a part of us now, it's like a body part, you can't expect to remove your kidney and be normal. Its the truth, the phone a part of you. Trying to cut it out is simply stupid because even though it has cons, it has way foo many pros. Now social media, I always find people telling to “ make a better version of yourself “ or “ to become next Bi Gates” delete your social media. Hell no. No. No. No.\\nSocial media is also a major part of our lives. The fact that you are giving it more importance is well, your fault. Social media is the place where everyone express themselves, we engage, we entertain ourselves. Our brain loves that. But we forget that anything in excess is toxic. Same way social media in excess is toxic. Just honestly try to cut down the time you spend on social media. When we use anything which entertain us, we stop thinking rationally. For example, you think of using quora for maybe 30 minutes but the clock hit 30 minutes and you are reading an amazing answer which will take maybe more 4 minutes, no harm. But after that four minutes, you end up engaging in other answers. So the key here is trying to become more conscious while doing things. Again there's no particular script to it. I can only say keep trying to become conscious and make rational decisions. Keep practicing, it's like learning to ride a bicycle. It just gets better with every try. Don't hate yourself just because you spent 60 millisecons more on a social media.\\nNow this will help you in getting resistant to distractions, well because you know what you have to do.\\nTo start with studying, start small. Maybe a page. Don't make learning the entire Bible your first goal. Start with a page, then more and more. Try concentrating on a page. If you find that hard, then well go more small. Concentrate on a single sentence. Believe that that's the sentence you want to understand for now. Try to visualize and think over what is written. Simply reading it in inattentive manner will get you nowhere. Remember learning a sentence which you have understood is million times easier than putting efforts in remembering it.   \n",

But one can certainly learn how to minimize its effects on oneself by learning how to do it. It is call developing resilience.\\nSecondly, negative thinking and lack of concentration, especially on studies, are attitudinal and behavioral issues. Both can be tackled through proper training.\\nSo everything boils down to one simple fact — one can learn to handle all situations through proper training of mind and body and then progress further.\\nThe only question remains — Does anybody want to invest time and money to learn these important skills?\\nBoth my personal and professional experiences tell me that such people are rare to find, especially in the modern times, where everybody is looking for shortcuts and instant gratification at the click of a button of a mouse.\\nBut that doesn’t happen. Nature has it’s own way of doing things. One has to get in sync with the ways of nature and not otherwise.\\nNow coming to your question — HOW CAN I?\\nYou can certainly do it if you invest at least 3 months of your life in learning how to do it and at least 9 more months in practicing the things that you have learned, before it becomes your second nature.\\nNow answer the following questions and decide for yourself:\\nAre you ready to do it?\\nDo you have it in you to do it?\\nIf yes, find someone to learn it from and transform yourself for your better future.\\nOr not.\\nThat’s all.   \n",

       "      <td>Possible lasting effects of seeing war footage on tv as a child, day in and out : I have diagnosed OCD. My diagnosis came about when my obsessive thoughts turned to hypochondria and it became unbearable. I have since been medicated with sertraline. \\n\\nAnyway so, as a child I had very obsessive thoughts about wars breaking out. I live in Europe and would constantly ask my elders if WW3 was coming or not. My grandmother actively experienced nazi occupation and she would reminisce a lot about everything she went through, she was about my age during the war when she told me those things.\\nAs I was born right before the new Millenium, I can't remember 9/11 but I do remember Iraq being a thing.\\n\\nVery much so, as I would spend many days a week at my grandparents place, dreading 6 o'clock cause I knew the channel would be changed to endless news reports and war footage. The living room was a very open space, my grandfather hard of hearing and so everything was very loud. I remember cringing and sitting in a corner, scared out of my mind of the bombings and shootings, bloody corpses that were being dragged, all shown on the big tv. \\nI couldn't look away, I was just sitting there nervously. Sometimes an adult would notice, and they would reassure me that it's far away but that didn't help. It was still *real*. That didn't stop the footage on television.\\n\\nThis fear has followed me ever since, when there was a terrorist threat in the early and mid 2010's I would have sleepless nights thinking about dying horribly. After Paris was attacked I knew my city (Brussels) was gonna be next, and I was right. When 2014 rolled around and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict seed was planted, I felt this neverending terror and wouldn't come out of bed for weeks. I was always thinking of that horrendous war footage that terrorized the hell out of young me.\\n\\nNow that was 8 years ago,\\nToday with the recent developments its the first time this feeling has come back to me in a very long time. My obsessive compulsions take many forms but the war stuff is one of the worst.\\nI know that right this moment I'm okay and it's sunny outside, children are singing and the world is waiting for me. Still, I can't just look away.. not with a smartphone in my hands.\\n\\nI don't know exactly why I'm sharing all of this right this moment, but I can't find anything online about people experiencing something like what I've written out. Maybe I'm one of the only ones and it doesn't help I have OCD.\\n\\nWar footage is really, really disturbing, especially to young minds. It's not nearly as bad as actually experiencing it, god no, but it's still something that can impact people negatively.</td>\n",

       "      <td>OCPD and OCD differ. A lot of people confuse them, even professionals.\\nEasiest way to sort is:\\nYou might call a OCPD, a jerk or worse because their personality sucks and is controlling. \"My way is the right way\". A personality disorder. They are going to remain that way because it has beliefs behind it. \"It is the only way for people to live, including you. If not, You're stupid.\"\\nOCD is about fear. Not getting the Jaws theme music out of your ears unless you DO something perfectly. More like a superstition. Turn the lock 5 times and then you can move on.\\nNow an interesting thing is when they get flagged for help.\\nOCD: Those compulsions take a lot of time and cause personal problems\\nOCPD, Has their family or friends finally get fed up with the rudeness and insistence everyone else conform to their version of the world.\\nI've listed the common Diagnostic components in the DSM IV\\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder is:\\nA pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:\\n(1) is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost\\n(2) shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met)\\n(3) is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)\\n(4) is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)\\n(5) is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value\\n(6) is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things\\n(7) adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes\\n(8) shows rigidity and stubbornness\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms include both obsessions and compulsions.\\nA. Either obsessions or compulsions:\\nObsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4):\\n(1) recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress\\n(2) the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems\\n(3) the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action\\n(4) the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion)\\nCompulsions as defined by (1) and (2):\\n(1) repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly\\n(2) the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive\\nB. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children.\\nC. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships.\\nD. If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an Eating Disorders; hair pulling in the presence of Trichotillomania; concern with appearance in the presence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder; preoccupation with drugs in the presence of a Substance Use Disorder; preoccupation with having a serious illness in the presence of Hypochondriasis; preoccupation with sexual urges or fantasies in the presence of a Paraphilia; or guilty ruminations in the presence of Major Depressive Disorder).\\nE. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.</td>\n",

I also can't help but feel like a pervert whenever I think a girl my age or a woman is pretty, like I'm being predatory. On a separate account on r/actuallesbians I made a post talking about how pretty I thought women were and I got a comment telling me that I was objectifying women. Now I feel like a gross predator even though all I did was say that women were pretty. I feel like the gross stereotype of the bisexual chick or lesbian chick that likes girls being a major weirdo towards girls.\\n\\nThere was also a conversation in my Spanish class about whether or not illegal immigrants should be considered illegal and I feel horrible for just not knowing the answer to that question. I feel awful just typing this, I can't handle moral questions if they don't have any definite answer, it has to be black or white or I start freaking out.\\n\\nI broke down crying last night and started hitting my head with my hands balled into fists as hard as I could just trying to make the thoughts stop. I'm frustrated with myself for being such a narcissist. I don't care if this is my OCD telling me this, this all feels real to me.</td>\n",

My diagnosis came about when my obsessive thoughts turned to hypochondria and it became unbearable. I have since been medicated with sertraline. \\n\\nAnyway so, as a child I had very obsessive thoughts about wars breaking out. I live in Europe and would constantly ask my elders if WW3 was coming or not. My grandmother actively experienced nazi occupation and she would reminisce a lot about everything she went through, she was about my age during the war when she told me those things.\\nAs I was born right before the new Millenium, I can't remember 9/11 but I do remember Iraq being a thing.\\n\\nVery much so, as I would spend many days a week at my grandparents place, dreading 6 o'clock cause I knew the channel would be changed to endless news reports and war footage. The living room was a very open space, my grandfather hard of hearing and so everything was very loud. I remember cringing and sitting in a corner, scared out of my mind of the bombings and shootings, bloody corpses that were being dragged, all shown on the big tv. \\nI couldn't look away, I was just sitting there nervously. Sometimes an adult would notice, and they would reassure me that it's far away but that didn't help. It was still *real*. That didn't stop the footage on television.\\n\\nThis fear has followed me ever since, when there was a terrorist threat in the early and mid 2010's I would have sleepless nights thinking about dying horribly. After Paris was attacked I knew my city (Brussels) was gonna be next, and I was right. When 2014 rolled around and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict seed was planted, I felt this neverending terror and wouldn't come out of bed for weeks. I was always thinking of that horrendous war footage that terrorized the hell out of young me.\\n\\nNow that was 8 years ago,\\nToday with the recent developments its the first time this feeling has come back to me in a very long time. My obsessive compulsions take many forms but the war stuff is one of the worst.\\nI know that right this moment I'm okay and it's sunny outside, children are singing and the world is waiting for me. Still, I can't just look away.. not with a smartphone in my hands.\\n\\nI don't know exactly why I'm sharing all of this right this moment, but I can't find anything online about people experiencing something like what I've written out. Maybe I'm one of the only ones and it doesn't help I have OCD.\\n\\nWar footage is really, really disturbing, especially to young minds. It's not nearly as bad as actually experiencing it, god no, but it's still something that can impact people negatively.   \n",
       "102361  OCPD and OCD differ. A lot of people confuse them, even professionals.\\nEasiest way to sort is:\\nYou might call a OCPD, a jerk or worse because their personality sucks and is controlling. \"My way is the right way\". A personality disorder. They are going to remain that way because it has beliefs behind it. \"It is the only way for people to live, including you. If not, You're stupid.\"\\nOCD is about fear. Not getting the Jaws theme music out of your ears unless you DO something perfectly. More like a superstition. Turn the lock 5 times and then you can move on.\\nNow an interesting thing is when they get flagged for help.\\nOCD: Those compulsions take a lot of time and cause personal problems\\nOCPD, Has their family or friends finally get fed up with the rudeness and insistence everyone else conform to their version of the world.\\nI've listed the common Diagnostic components in the DSM IV\\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder is:\\nA pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:\\n(1) is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost\\n(2) shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met)\\n(3) is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)\\n(4) is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)\\n(5) is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value\\n(6) is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things\\n(7) adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes\\n(8) shows rigidity and stubbornness\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms include both obsessions and compulsions.\\nA. Either obsessions or compulsions:\\nObsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4):\\n(1) recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress\\n(2) the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems\\n(3) the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action\\n(4) the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion)\\nCompulsions as defined by (1) and (2):\\n(1) repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly\\n(2) the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive\\nB. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children.\\nC. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships.\\nD. If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an Eating Disorders; hair pulling in the presence of Trichotillomania; concern with appearance in the presence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder; preoccupation with drugs in the presence of a Substance Use Disorder; preoccupation with having a serious illness in the presence of Hypochondriasis; preoccupation with sexual urges or fantasies in the presence of a Paraphilia; or guilty ruminations in the presence of Major Depressive Disorder).\\nE. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.   \n",

I also can't help but feel like a pervert whenever I think a girl my age or a woman is pretty, like I'm being predatory. On a separate account on r/actuallesbians I made a post talking about how pretty I thought women were and I got a comment telling me that I was objectifying women. Now I feel like a gross predator even though all I did was say that women were pretty. I feel like the gross stereotype of the bisexual chick or lesbian chick that likes girls being a major weirdo towards girls.\\n\\nThere was also a conversation in my Spanish class about whether or not illegal immigrants should be considered illegal and I feel horrible for just not knowing the answer to that question. I feel awful just typing this, I can't handle moral questions if they don't have any definite answer, it has to be black or white or I start freaking out.\\n\\nI broke down crying last night and started hitting my head with my hands balled into fists as hard as I could just trying to make the thoughts stop. I'm frustrated with myself for being such a narcissist. I don't care if this is my OCD telling me this, this all feels real to me.   \n",

It becomes harmful when it directly affects daily living activities and quality of life. At the lower end of the spectrum\\nit can consume one's thoughts and mental activity. At the greater end\\nof the spectrum it can consume multiple hours of the day performing\\ncompulsions to the point where one is trapped in their own home unable\\nto work, maintain relationships and stay healthy.\\nThe anxiety associated with OCD can place mental and physical stress that can be quite taxing and destructive. Without proper guidance and education OCD can harm marriages and families. Many spouses and family members lack an understanding of OCD which can negatively affect relationships. Many of\\nthese problems can remedied by educating family members about the\\nsymptoms and difficulties of OCD and and understanding of what to\\nexpect.\\nOften times OCD can start out with minor symptoms of checking and\\nwashing. If not treated properly, the symptoms can become more severe to\\nthe point of consuming one's day with rituals of checking and washing.\\nIt is important to find treatment early on before symptoms worsen.\\n\\nWe have worked with a step-by-step scientifically grounded and clinically proven\\napproach for OCD that harnesses the brain's untapped potential. Founded\\nat UCLA, this method combines Cognitive Behavioral Method (CBT) with\\nMindfulness. To learn more about this method visit http://www.tendingsouls.com/four-step-method/.   \n",

I often have intrusive thoughts about embarrassing, awkward, or offensive things I did as a kid and a teenager. It’s always that embarrassing intrusive thought of something I did or said back in 3rd grade, 4th grade, 1st grade, 6th grade, or in high school.   \n",
