0,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.
Update 15/11/14
Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
1,"Honestly the only way I myself would describe it is, you are just eyes in a body that is letting the things you see control you. It is NOT fun. I wake up in the morning to atleast 5 people in my room,faces I've never seen before, they ignore me as I walk out of my room, when I light up my morning cigarette I hear them say "" she's going to die before we get to her"" which is terrifying to hear, then they say "" we wait till till she's asleep, we preform the procedure "" what procedure? What are they talking about? When I get back into my room they are FBI agents, they tell me to leave but don't go outside BUT LEAVE.. ?? I also I see human bodies with animal head that tower over houses and stare at me from a distance, I see bodies hanging from doorways I see ceiling fans spinning on the grass, I see black hands coming out of faucets and drains, mirrors, walls. I hear a voice , a ""robot voice"" that keeps me up at night, saying things like "" my programming tells me you love me! You can't leave me, you are mine, you can't leave me YOU ARE MINE"" and things in that context. But my main most important hallucination is jack, he is a tall well kept man, blonddish white hair a top hat and a orange suit, he was my very first hallucination, he was evil, he was my worst nightmare and more. After these 6 years, he has taken form of my friends, lovers, family, it's so hard to look at him. But he also is always there when I have panic attacks, or I'm anxious, paranoid or worrying, he makes sure I am safe. I refuse to talk back to my voices, I don't want to start falling into their shit. schizophrenia fucking SUCKS",schizophrenia
2,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
3,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
4,"Well, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005. I studied in a reputed school and I was bullied heavily. My parents neglected me. My teachers ignored me. During the examinations, one night I opened the locks of my door and I ran away from my house, barefoot. For around seventy-hours, I was loitering in the streets with no food, water, money, shoes or even clothes. I slept on the streets and sometimes the weather was fierce like heavy rainfall etc. Goons tried to kill me. Some had even beaten me. I came in front of a fast moving car but miraculously survived. After three days, I found someone who gave me clothes and then he brought me home.
After reaching my house, I was rushed to a hospital. There my hands and feet were all tied up and I was given multiple shots of injection. I could barely walk, talk or eat with my hands then.
After around two weeks I was taken back to my house. I continued my medication but after a few months my medications were stopped as my parents thought that I had recovered.
In July 2006, I was rushed to a neuropsychologist because I was talking nonsense and behaving weirdly. I was told in my report that besides schizophrenia I had developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder) due to the side effects of medications. I again had to be given medications.
Some of my weird experiences during those time were :
1. I thought I was Lord Krishna and that people respect/worship me. I sometimes even made poses like him (in public places) as if he was standing in a dancing pose holding the flute. I also believed that I was Lord Buddha who has attained nirvana.
2. I thought that Hilary Duff was my soulmate and that she would marry me. I thought she was sending me special messages via the TV.
3. I thought that I was responsible for the deaths of people who have died in plane crash and in 9/11. I even cried a lot for feeling guilty (in public)
4. I thought the TV news anchors were speaking about me.
5. I felt beautiful smell of roses were coming out of HBO TV channel and that the smell color was green.
6. I felt I could control the movement of the sun or I could control the weather. I felt I could move ceiling fan with the help of my mind only.
7. I thought people were inserting their fists in my anus and taking away my knowledge, intelligence. This thought was intense and scared me a lot.
8. I often went out of my house with shirts buttoned in wrong places and with only one shoe in my feet.
9. I heard airplanes flying everyday at some specific times .
1o. I thought I had cancer, malaria, aids etc. and that Bill Gates was looking to cure my illnesses. I even thought that he would fly a special plane directly to my house and take me to US.
11. I thought President Bush was trying to recruit me in the Secret Service because I thought that I was psychic.
12. I felt people could read my thoughts and insert their thoughts in my head.
13. Once a car driver was trash talking to another driver in filthy language. I thought they were talking about me (which was of course not true)
14. Once I had to visit my doctor. Now the doctor's clinic was just beside a school for the blind. My mother was on the phone talking to my father who was giving her directions of the doc's clinic and referred to the blind school. I screamed loudly to mom saying, "" please don't take me to the blind school as I was not blind.""
15. I thought I was special. One day a teacher entered the classroom. Obviously the teacher was standing on entering the classroom. On seeing the teacher other students also stood up and said good morning. I remained seated because I thought that I had special psychic powers and that I was their boss so they were all standing and I could sit.
16. I was once going to my doctor, in a rented car. My father was sitting beside me in the back seat. There were two people in the front. After some time, in the middle of the journey I raised both my arms thinking that I was God and I started saying something loudly. I thought I was God and that I had special powers. That was very embarrassing as not only the strangers in the front but also the general crowd (in traffic jams) could see the way I was behaving.
17. I thought I could move objects with my mind, had seen ghosts, devil. I even thought that the word/concept ""eternity"" was actually a living being and that he has been my friend millions of yrs ago and that now he was calling me.
18. I did not care to take care of my hygiene. During that period I rarely brushed or had shower.
19. I thought people in Africa were starving so I often refused to eat my food feeling guilty that while I was filling my stomach, they starved.
20. I thought people were throwing stones/bricks at my house at night because I felt that they knew I have caused all the problems in the world (which was of course false)
Most of the above things happened in 2005-2006.
Fast forward to 2016.
In August 2016, my doctor stopped my medications. I no longer take them. I have a MBA (marketing) degree from a reputed college. I also started working in a bank from last week. I have a few close friends and I am in a relationship for over two years.
I have experienced a lot in my life and I believe that there is a lot left to learn and experience. I believe schizophrenia can be a ""gift"" only if we are aware of this illness and accept the fact that something is not right with us. By doing so, we can reduce the effect of the illness to a great extent.",schizophrenia
5,"Firstly, thank you for asking this question and apologise for writing my answer anonymously, I don’t want to risk old or current employers finding out about my illness.
This is what I remember with suffering from schizophrenia for about 5 years. I want to add, when I was first diagnosed, I was told that I would have the illness for life and that I should take medication, which I declined to take as told it would only dampen my voices and not get rid of them.
I did get support from a psychiatrist (who also suffered with schizophrenia since a little boy) for the first year or so and I sometimes attended a group where I met other schizophrenic sufferers and we all shared our experiences to try and help eachother. Everyone had different experiences and some coped well, leading ‘normal’ lives and other people unable to work and needing a lot of care.
Here is a list of the things I remember:
It was really Frightening
It was the most frightening experience I have had ever had. Imagine hearing a voice, or a few voices that want threaten you and want to kill you constantly, for god knows how many months, years. Although I knew what I was hearing was not real, my heart still raced with tremendous fear, I could not eat, and I was scared to do normal things like enter a room because a voice would say if I went in there, I would be knifed. I knew there was not a person in the room and that the threatening voice could not harm me but still it took guts to go into that room. This is just one example of the many frightening experiences of hearing voices. Some experiences were so frightening that I thought I would die in my sleep or I wanted and sometimes tried to commit suicide because I just could not cope with the fear. I have learned to be brave from this experience in real life.
No Privacy
I used to hate going to the toilet, especially when I needed to do a number two. I would hear voices discuss what I was doing and it felt like they were in the cubicle with me. I longed to be feel alone. I longed to go to the toilet and feel like it was a private experience, just like it was before I heard voices.
Hearing voices also made it difficult to be intimate with anyone. I tried but I would hear negative voices. It always felt like the voices were there in the room and again a running commentary on what was happening. I definately did not have any romance for the first few years due to this problem with hearing voices.
It was a Secret
Imagine meeting someone for the first time and saying ‘Hi, my name is Dorothy and I’m a voice hearer’. It’s just would not of have happened, so I kept it hidden until I trusted that person and I never, ever told any employers (another story there).
It was quite hard to hear voices and try and act/live normally in life. An internal sense of humour, for example the ability to tell myself private jokes, really helped me to not take voice hearing so seriously. I worked hard to focus on listening and responding to real people and over time the voices became quieter until one day I realised they were no longer there.
Physical Health
I made sure I exercised everyday as I was told by my psychiatrist that this would help me. I really don’t know if it did help because I was feeling constantly on edge with hearing voices all day and night. I know I lost a lot of weight and that was partly due to never having an apetite and all the exercise.
Time Out
I would have some days where I just longed to be truly alone. I was sometimes physical alone but there were always a few voices talking, that I could hear, whether I wanted to or not. The only time I never heard any voices was in my sleep. I would sometimes break down and cry in public, did not mean to but it would just get to much. Some people were kind and ask me what was wrong and I would never say. Just say I’m ok and going home. I just longed to not hear a voice. I really value peace and quiet now. I really love to just sit in a room and hear nothing but the wind or a bird, it is the best thing ever.
Gift
Over time, the voices became less negative, threatening and bullying. I found that I could imagine a song and hear it like it was really playing on the radio. This was fantastic, I could imagine the music and hear it without the need of equipment. I discovered that this helped me. Now that I no longer hear voices, I can no longer hear music like that and I do actually miss that, it felt like a gift.
Problems with Medical Help
The first person I told when I started to hear voices was a doctor. I had met him for the first time because I was new to the area. He treated me like I could not understand me and laughed, got excited and said that I would be known as the local nut and be called the Voodoo Girl. To this day, I want to find out if he has treated anyone else badly that was vunerable and report him.
I had a brain scan and it got lost, so I have never known the results from that. I was not offered another brain scan.
I had inconsistent care workers visiting me at home, so I never truly built up a relationship with anyone medically trained to help me. I explained to one worker that I was seeing strange shapes and sparkling lights and she just said it was part of my condition. I learned a few years later that what I was seeing was floaters and sparkling lights were part of that condition.
My psychiatrist was a god send and taught me that I was not alone. He also made me realise that you can still achieve things in life with the condition. I really admired him, since he suffered with voice hearing from a very young age. Without meeting him, I don’t know where I would be now. It seems no one else in the profession really cared or helped, they were just doing there job and moving on so what they did not matter. Shame they did not realise the next person was also going to be moving on, and the next person.
Family and Friends
They would sometimes get annoyed that I appeared to be staring into space. I was probably hearing something really frightening and therefore the voices held my attention more than what they were saying. What would get your attention more, a family member discussing what they bought at the supermarket or a voice telling you that God wants to know what you are doing. I think it was hard for family and friends to understand how voices can absorb you into a different world and that it took a lot of time to come out of that. It must have driven them mad to feel not listened to and to see their loved one experiencing completely nutty things in their head.
I have tried to cover aspects of being a schizophrenia that maybe a person who has never heard voices before would take for granted. Like everyone else here, I have experienced completely nutty voice hullacations and I bargained with them constantly to go away (bargain with voices that are not real - crazy), but these are other stories and may only mean something to me, not you, you may laugh, which is fine, or just think whoa, she was nuts. I must admit, I laughed at some peoples hallucinations here because I understand and if I did not laugh, then I would cry.",schizophrenia
6,"I do not have a mental illness, but I was profoundly influenced by someone who did. It's a long story, but I hope you'll read it to the end.
The mother of my childhood friend was manic schizophrenic, and her initial psychotic break was so severe that she had been subjected to shock treatments. The first time I met her, I was six year old, and she stood on our porch endlessly, rhythmically, ""marching in place"" as the spheres of her brain tried to figure out which one was supposed to be dominant. ""Alice"" asked if her daughter, ""Lisa"" was in my home. I said no, and she suddenly started casting fearful glances around her. I asked her what was wrong, and she confided that her husband would send house cats out to spy on her if she was gone too long from home. I was hooked right there. This lady was to most awesome adult I had ever met.
My wealthy, self-made parents were ardently wooed by Lisa, who could not understand my ingratitude in being born to the likes of them instead of her parents. Lisa never acknowledged that my parents were cold, arbitrary, negligent, and deeply self-absorbed. I was taught how to keep house and make simple meals as soon as I was able to stand in a chair, as I was often left to fend for myself for days as my parents flew their Cessna planes to remote wilderness hunting soirees. Being fed the grilled cheese sandwiches and too-sweet Kool-Aid Alice would make for me would bring tears of joy to my eyes every time. The food was cheap and simple, but the company and nurture were sustenance for more than just my body.
I was enthralled by Alice's stories of how long-dead presidents and contemporary pop stars had secretly produced a long litany of illegitimate children with each other; of cats with powers akin to those of Chinese Dragons; of the conspiracy between our government and members of the spirit world to use technology to control us, and many more tales of wonder she was convinced were the gospel truth.
Don't get me wrong, I had falling outs with Alice too. Alice flatly refused to believe that aliens existed. ""The fantasies of paranoid crazy people"" she said. I had to learn the hard way not to use the history lessons that Alice gave me on my tests at school. I would get mad at Alice for letting her husband and daughter treat her the way they did and for pretending like she didn't hear them. And they in turn pretended that they couldn't see her tears.
As I grew older, I began to understand Alice and her life in more adult terms, and it was very difficult to accept. Alice's IQ was right through the roof, and in her unpredictably random, unsettling, brief moments of complete lucidity, she would talk on topics of advance medicine, psychiatry, world politics, and criminal law. I'd fact-check her lucid moment lectures, and everything was not only cogent, it was so up-to-date it was cutting-edge. How did she translate stuff she'd read about in her self-described phases of ""waxing looney"" into completely sound logic when she was temporarily sane? Alice was unmedicated, so how did she get these brief but powerful moments of lucidity? The most rage-inspiring part of this was that pretty much everyone else around her was crazy and stupid enough to think that being crazy somehow translated into being stupid too. Just like when people talk to non-English speakers as if they are deaf and not terribly bright, people would talk to Alice like she was a potentially violent retarded child. Even when Alice was in full-blown mania, she was smart and dangerously perceptive. But, to the best of my knowledge, Alice never hurt anyone, intentionally, or otherwise. In fact, Alice saved my life once.
I had been flying a kite close to her home in the dead of winter. The kite string cut deep into my fingers and hand, but it did not bleed. I was suddenly very sleepy, and I don't remember walking through the blizzard. When I woke up, I was in Alice's home, and she was preventing me from trying to sit right on top of her space heater. This was one of her moments of utter lucidity, and she told me not to let her husband discover us while she rapidly applied expert first-aid to my hands and fingers, including two stiches in a cut that was slowly oozing darkened blood. I was in my early teens now, and I asked her how she knew what she was doing, so, she pulled a pile of folders and showed me. She had been a high-functioning medical researcher and nurse before her madness manifested. It was an extraordinary and heartbreaking narrative. Her vast repertoire of skill sets, accolades, a brilliant future ahead of her. She had been far ahead of her time, and she had been shackled to a husband that wanted her to throw all of that away to be a full-time housewife and mother. When her psychotic break happened, her wishes died, and his became her only hope of living outside a mental ward. He and her children treated her with contempt, while the rest of the world spoke to her in tones of condescension or embarrassed dismissal...If and when she was even noticed at all.
When Alice's husband died, she was put in a mental ward and just left there. No visits from her family or children, and no one sane to talk to her like the highly gifted and intelligent human being she was. Alice rapidly became catatonic, and when I tried to take actions to acquire legal guardianship of her, Alice was quietly moved someplace I've been unable to locate. Likely, out of the country. Every night I think about her, and sometimes I remember an argument I had with her daughter, Lisa. I was fourteen, and pissed at Lisa, because she was shamelessly trying to push me out of my family and insert herself in. After a teenage-angst-ridden argument about whose mom was the better one, Lisa asked me, ""Do you think if you had been the one born to my mother, that you would feel the way you do about her now?"" I could not give her a good answer at the time, but I was certain that if she knew what my mother was really about, she might want to reconsider her wishes. After nearly seven years of helping my mother get through bouts of cancer and surgeries, I have an answer for Lisa's question. If I could endure my sociopathic mother's lovelessness with duty, respect, and dignity, I could deal with Alice's warm and wild insanity with the same. Crazy people have the same capacity for love, empathy, perception, compassion, and suffering as sane people do. Sociopaths like my mother, do not. Alice cannot change or control what she thinks and does. She cannot be held responsible for these things. I can, and so I will, because thanks to Alice's circumstances, I know what happens if I don't. I love you Alice, and it's thanks to you that I was touched by love and magic when I needed it most. From the ashes of your life and dignity, came the flame that ever warms and comforts me in mine.",schizophrenia
7,"I am an Indian guy living and working in the US. It started in the June of 2017. I was a single guy living the dream life, working in a Fortune 500 company in Chicago. I went to visit my friend in Boston, and enjoyed everything there except a singular incident - the misbehavior of a waitress at a restaurant we went to. The waitress behaved well with my friend but was rude with me and laughed at me. This annoyed me and I did not tip her, determined not to come back to the restaurant at any cost. When I flew back to Chicago, I was paranoid, thinking that the flight attendants and crew were watching and profiling me due to my brown skin. A few days passed. I was feeling lonely and was advised to make new friends in Chicago. I met a potential roommate in early June, and spent 6 hours befriending him in Chicago. I bared my heart out to him over alcohol, confiding in him my deepest and darkest secrets. I thought I had made a friend for life, but later found out that the person was a sociopath. He didn’t care about me and about what I told him. I had just told all my secrets to the sociopath. This broke me. I tried to cry but only a single tear rolled down my eye. I requested the landlord to not allow the guy to live in the house. The landlord agreed and I was at peace for a few days. But I was still scared of the guy and what he could do with the information I gave him. Then, a new guy moved in. That guy laughed at me when he saw me and told me “I know where you work” in a chilling voice. The landlord and my other roommate started laughing at me. I was horrified and concluded that the sociopath had spread some information about me to the new guy, landlord and my other roommate. I was worried because my parents were coming to my house to visit me, and I was scared of what the new guy could blackmail them and me with. I tried to find a new apartment but the new landlord seemed to know me and laughed at me too. I was now terrified and decided to stay in the same apartment, as I had no other options. I went to office the next day and heard people laughing at me behind my back. I heard my manager and colleagues laughing at me. I was in disbelief and shell shocked. My parents landed in Chicago. I told them everything about how people were laughing at me , but they refused to believe me. They said I was imagining things. Then the next day I went to work and on the way to work I saw people in the streets of Chicago laughing at me and saying nasty things about me. I panicked and threw my phone into the dustbin because I thought the police were tracking me (for no reason). I bought a new phone and removed all my old contacts. I tried to stay under the radar for as long as I could. But wherever I went, people would laugh at me. They would point and make sarcastic comments and laugh at me. I went to the temple to volunteer and while I was volunteering I saw people laugh at me. That hurt me because I loved volunteering at the temple. I lost faith in god. I didn’t know why the world had become so cruel all of a sudden. My parents took me to a doctor. He said it was work stress ( but he was winking and laughing at me). I went back to work. My manager would shout at me because I was unable to work because everybody was laughing at me everyday. She put me on a performance improvement plan. I worked my ass off ,ignored everyone and got good reviews in the PIP. People were still laughing at me. But I was someone now. I had become a man again. I had proved that even if the world laughs at me, I can become successful. Thus 6 months passed. I ignored the laughter as much as I could. However other delusions started entering my mind. I thought my parents were aliens and I was the only human being left on Earth. I struggled with other delusions. I went to India for a month and suffered more hallucinations there, but I was used to the laughter and could bear it better now. I came back to Chicago in January 2018. Then the worst phase started. It was freezing cold in Chicago and the visual and sensory hallucinations began. I started seeing ghosts at night, I started feeling ghosts entering my body and possessing me. The feeling of demonic possession devastated me. My mother came to visit me in Chicago around this time. I thought she was a ghost as the government had killed my parents last June. The hallucinations persisted even in my dreams, people laughed at me there as well. One chilly morning, I beat up my mother (thinking I was Hanuman (a Hindu god) and she was the devil) and ran out of the apartment. I finally was free and ran barefoot on the cold pavement. The police came. They put me in handcuffs. They took me to hospital. I was screaming that I hadn’t done anything wrong. Then I lost consciousness and slept. The next few days were blurry. I heard voices laughing at me, but they became weaker. The doctor would pop pills in my mouth every night. I was in hospital for a week. I went on a leave of absence from work. I realized that I had schizophrenia. The medicine would make me very drowsy and sleepy. But it helped make the voices go away. I switched to a new doctor and new medicine , and felt better. I have been on medication for over a year now. I’m working well and received a performance bonus for last year. My new boss respects me and considers me his best staff. There is no cure for schizophrenia. It can only be treated. But I know now that the world does not laugh at me. I know now that I am strong and brave. I know now that I am a man. And I know that I will keep fighting. Until the very end.",schizophrenia
8,"Some notes
English isn't my mother language, so if I misspell some specifc word from health area I'm sorry. I'm brazilian btw.
I've had a Schizophrenia episode, which lasted for 4 months. Now I have Bipolar Disorder, according to my psychiatrist. I take pills at the moment just for the bipolar
I will write this anonymously because I think there might be a chance that I know might read this, anyway this is one of my paranoid with internet xd. I will hide some minor facts, since it happened recently ( 3 years ago)
It's pretty long, so you can skip to the blackpart, where it gets more serious.
Minor backstory about me.
I'm a guy studying to pass college exam so I can study Computer Science. I quitted school at 8 grade because of bullying ( more mental than physical) then had a depression for over 3 years.
During 1 year I lived like a Hikikomori, which is basically someone who exclude himself from society, never leaving his house or room. Everyday when I woke up, I would turn on the computer to play a game called S4 League, that I can say it helped a lot during that time.
Then I started at 2013 to make a course about computers, mostly hardware. It was a 1 year and 6 months course. But at July 2013 I made the trip that would change the thing
The moment before the Schizophrenia
I had a trip to Well Famous Theme Park at Orlando, and I would go with my aunt, uncle and sister for 2 weeks. I never travelled abroadback then without my mom.
At the first week I was normal, I was feeling normal like its a regular trip with your family. I was 17 at that time. But at the second week things started to look weird.
Coming back before the trip, I was doing therapy with a psychologist. Even thought I didnt feellike it was working, because during that time I had 3 psychologists, went to religious places, etc. Anyway I was trying to find something that could help me, since everyone near me said I was smart, I ended up founding an Organization of High IQ. In the website they say that you have to pay a fee annually to be a membership if you pass the test. This info changed everything
Second week and allucinations
So when I was in US I looked at the site and in my head it was like the fee was actually the payment for being part of the organization. So for me it was like winning in the lottery, since you can join a group of High IQ and get paid for it. I started talking to my family at the trip about that and they said I was crazy.
One day later I bought a smartphone, so I could talk with my friends now, and then it just get down. I remember saying to them ( still got some backup files) that I could control the atoms. I don't remember how I got to that conclusion ( I didn't had studied much of chemistry, since I didn't go to high school). And that I would kill them and then revive them. The good thing about this part is that they thought I was drunk.
I started to talk more than usual, and with anyone. I stopped people at the Theme Park and started asking then things like if they wanted to fly, because in my mind,at that time, to fly you just need to change the atoms below the feet so they could push you up. My aunt made me sit in the Harry Potter park because I kept talking to stranger.
Then I started thinking that I could telepathy with persons, so I sent a ""message"" for the High IQ organization to pick me up at the hotel. Luckily it was late so there wasn't any cars arriving. At the same night, I went outside of the hotel so that they could pick me up somewhere else. I walked for a few blocks then I came across a building, with a lot of glasses, and sat near it. It was 2am probably. Waited for over 30 mins then I came back to the hotel and fell asleep at the hotel hall sofa.
My family was desperate at that point, they increased the amount of pills I had to take, which were antidepressants, but unfortunately they made it worse, since everyday I was more and more active.
Before the airport, when I left the hotel, I remember looking at the sky and seeing some airplane smoke, like the one in cartoons where they draw words with them, and it was written ""Love God"". I thought that the High IQ group did it. When I was in a restaurant, I saw a guys with some notebooks and I thought that they were the ones who did the smoke stuff. So I waved to them and winked. Luckily they didn't get mad or anything, just laughed. I also thought that they were the only real persons, or the persons who could take me out of this simulation, or could control it, looking like Matrix
Ps: I first watched matrix in january 2016.
When I arrived at the airport, when entering the gate to catch the plane, I remember looking back and viewing people from my school, friends, family, basically everyone that was part of my life. Of course it was a delusion. How could everyone that I ever met or contributed to my life could be in a airport from another country?
So I made a conclusion that I was the subject of a test. Kinda like The Trueman Show, except that I was going on cycles, like a program, and I always died either after I quit school or during that trip, that's why they were there, to show me that all the suffering I was going to wasn't unintended, they had a purpose for it. Basically I was in a program/simulation and that I had the key to save the real world and they would get it after the trip, so the trip was last stage.
When I got to the plane, I started saying things they should improve on this simulation, so I would be doing suicide over and over again, yo make it easier. And when I heard the pen clicks, for me it was their answer, so that's how I communicated with them. I also saw my father, who died in 2009, in the airplane. He got divorced from my mom and I didn't like him too much. Also saw my grandparents, who died before I was born.
I started asking them to go to Japan, because I wanted to visit there ( I'm half brazilian and half japanese), asked money and a lot of stuff. Also I heard that everyone was happy because it was finally over, so they could go live their normal lives. So I asked them to join together and make a circle so we could celebrate.
Ps: I just watched Truman Show last month.
When I arrive to the airport, when I saw people talking I interpreted as they were saying "" its finally over, took soo long but its over! Now we can go home!"". When I passed duty free, I thought that I got betrayed, that I suffered for a lot of people. I said that they ( High IQ) failed when they showed the truth, that it was unfair making someome suffer when you could avoid it.
This is where I reached the bottom, literally, the worst that could happen. I sat down on the floor, started saying some japanese words and with my right hand I made the gun gesture shooting to my head. I started asking to a guard for a gun. Some mens nearby saw this and tackled me to the ground. I didn't punch them or so ever. I felt that I could resist them for a while, I had 126kg + back then. One moment they immobilized me, they were 4-5,and I passed out. If wasn't for these guys, I definitely wouldn't be here today.
When I woke up, I was in a ambulance with my mother ( shes medic) and paramedics. They were saying calm down sir calm down. Had belts on both arms and legs. I struggled for a few minutes, and passed out.
Woke up in some kind of hospital, with belts still on, struggling brutally and a lady said calm down or I wont take these belts off! So I relaxed a little and fell asleep.
When I woke up, I felt like I was in a prison or something ( actually I was in a CAPS Centro de Atenção Psicossocial – Wikipédia, a enciclopédia livre, which means Psychosocial Attention Center literally, and its a place where you can get treatment for a few days, its totally free.)
Most beds were stretcher and it was a small place. Basically 2 rooms, 1 for women and 1 for men, and living room with 2 sofas and 1 television. I was still dizzy from passing out. There were a lot of guys who were walking strangely, not like they had a physical injury.
I stayed there for 1 week and I went back home. A few months later my mother asked me if I didnt remember what happened during last 2 months. I said I didn't. She said that I was hitting my head on the door, that I hit it against the car, that I kept opening and closing the refrigerator. So basically I don't have any memory of August and September 2013.
For a few months I kept talking to the tv, when the news host said good night, I replied him. When a video from YouTube started to buffering, I thought that they ( High IQ) were trying to talk with me or listening to me (because when I finish talking, usually the video stopped buffering, so I thought I was communicating with them .
By July 2014 I can say I got back to this reality.
And no, I don't believe in God, although I'm agnostic. I believe in some theories.
If there is a pro about this experience, is that I got more mature and I can see things more clarified.
The cons about this is that my relationship with my auntie and uncle got worse, like I can't look to them without remembering what happened and I dont know why but I threw away a 60USD mouse in the trash when I got back. I thought that I threw away the doongle from the wireless headset that I bought at GameStop but I found it last year. And also my sister, since this was kinda a birthday trip for her and I made her cry, said I was gonna kill her. .
Well that's it, sorry if I misspell something or made it too much repetitive, I just told this to my psychiatrist, my psychologist, mother and sister. I don't feel like talking this with friends since for me its better if they think I was drunk then that I had Schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
9,"When I’ve read the post of Anon user I was convinced that I need to share my story too about being schizophrenic. I think people need to have as many of information we can get to help them better understand this condition. If Anon User is luckier then I’m luckiest… ha ha I know having this illness isn’t much of a luck but compare to him I don’t suffer from it within a regular basis. My case seems to be a very mild one. Right now I no longer have prescriptions and I just take care of myself by taking food supplement, making sure I get enough sleep and not too pressured, I stay away from alcohol but once in a while when there’s an occasion I’m okay to drink, and I have a job. But I want to share my experience about it my female version along with its hallucinations.
The Root of the Evil

I’ve just graduated from college, I was 20 then. My mom and I argue a lot because she didn’t want me to go to the big city for work and forcing me to do what she wants which made me depressed. I was aware that I am going through a depression so I went to seek help but people didn’t believe me. Because when they heard my story I’m saying that I’m doing all the things that I’m doing now for my mom and I was paranoid that photos of me where in the internet and there is such a website that was made just for me and everything about me is in there. I kept searching for it but it seems the people behind this are too good in computers that I was the only one that has been blocked from the site and everybody is already talking about it. I was asking for help from a Guidance Counselor to help me find the website and I want to sue people because I know who they are.

And I had a proof because I was aware that people are taking pictures of me and videos too while I’m in the campus or hanging out just outside the campus since 2nd year college up to that very minute. Obviously it wasn’t hallucination back then but this time it is already and it’s hard to figure that out because I had prior evidence before this incident. And the Counselor is pretty much aware of that so he’s not making it a big deal thinking I’m just being paranoid because I was the shy type then that didn’t want to be pictured and they know from the fact that my Friendster was very private but they got all the idea about my weirdness in it. Maybe you are wondering why, hmmm… this is the first time I’m going to admit this in written form that I was aware of my admirers. Pictures of me appeared in our school paper and other stuff like a poetry book but discreetly it’s either I’m in the middle of a group of people or it’s showing my back but there’s one large sketch of my face that had been pinned for months on the School Paper Headquarters bulletin right at their door. They put me on the centerfold for a school magazine with my back head-to-toe shot occupying almost half of the whole spread and labeled it mystery girl for women’s month along with some small head-shots of pretty girls group in the left side with a tagline that says something like “Who needs fairies when they are roaming around the campus?” Everyone in that issue was asked except me if I wanted that feature because they know the answer is No. I didn’t believe first that that’s me even if it’s screaming right in my face that I know that back, the hair, the shirt, the pants, the way how the elbow is bend and the hands touching on that hips. That’s how I stand when I talk to people and I pretty much have the idea of the exact place where it had been taken and the day it was taken (I don’t repeat clothes in a span of 1 – 3 months so it was easy for me to pin point it through the clothes I was wearing in that particular picture). So when I started hearing people saying “Oh she’s the girl? Why is that they didn’t show her face, she’s cute.” I started to act awkward trying to deny that I was that mystery girl and even taught myself not to do the same pose every time I remember it I try to change that mannerism and I avoided wearing that favorite shirt of mine.

I started memorizing car plates to know people who are stalking me. Because we have a lot of cars either just passing by inside the subdivision or parking near our house and our neighborhood is starting to be alarmed wondering for the shiny cars roaming around our place. Maybe some girls would want that attention but I was different I just wanted to be a regular student hanging out with ordinary people and avoiding those rich kids and socialites in our school. Yeah, it was like a teen-flick and it sucks.

My First Episodes

I was crying for days and my family finally discovered that I have a problem. I remember that I just stop going out, taking a bath is forgotten, as well as using tooth brush. My cousin asked me to join him to a party because he knows that I’m a party girl. I was I used to party up ‘til dawn but to his dismay I refused and he left me still crying non-stop.

Then I applied for a job but after 2 days on training I wasn’t able to report for the 3rd day because I’m starting to feel that people in that company and the customers as well are accusing me of stealing some things. I didn’t know about it but I was so guilty because when I was a child I did stole a thing. In my case it seems my hallucinations are rooted from my past experiences, desires, whims and fears. That it seems so real, it’s impossible not to believe.

I was in my best friend’s house and discovered that Paris Hilton is actually talking to me through the TV. It was weird but she’s using our language. How did she ever know that? Then I stopped going to my friend’s house because all of their neighbors are already talking about me???

And our country has its own Big Brother show and I happened to have a diary when I was in 4th grade starting with the words “I always wanted a big brother” and thought they are already making the story of my life in that reality show. I was watching it and was pretty convinced that I am the original of the story and the 13 people in it are representations of all my personalities since I have multiple personalities (which I believe I have). And sometimes they acted things that are so me and I was already thinking of claiming the prizes that I deserve for being the original of that show but I didn’t know how? So I ask my aunt about it since my mom is the mastermind of all this. She wants to sell me to some rich man so she can be a millionaire out of me and my aunt naturally kind as she is just tried to ignore me and change the topic. And I’m so shy to ask about that again because she might think I’m hallucinating but I know I’m telling the truth and it’s real. Crazy stuff!

Medication

My mom started bringing me to different neurologists and psychiatrist but when they interview me I stopped saying things that I know will make them think I’m crazy. My mom already suspected that I don’t trust people so she brought me to a doctor whom is our close relative but when she started with “What is your problem?” I know she wouldn’t believe me because she’s also included in this conspiracy. Everyone in my family had been paid by someone so powerful and rich that they are just waiting for me to get crazy before they shipped me somewhere abroad so they can study how the brain of someone with multiple personality works. Or the other theory, that the drugs my mom is giving me are actually contraceptive pills that won’t ever let me have kids because some gang will have me as their sex slave. Then will throw me away in the streets so I can finally roam already mad and no one will care about.

They let me take psychological tests and they can’t find anything abnormal. My answers are all good, no signs of any weirdness or craziness. Until one day, my younger sister was using the computer and I noticed that she was able to use the internet but when it was already my turn suddenly the net is cut. I accused her of stealing my boyfriend (btw there is no real bf) by using my Friendster account and talking to him. I started becoming violent, turned the gas range on and let it burn until my mom had stopped it. Then I’d tried to punch my sister and since she’s my mom’s favorite daughter my mom helped her. After a few minutes my older cousin came in and my mom was able to get a rod and tied my hands and feet. It was so painful and I felt like a criminal, better an animal like a dog for impound. They said I need to go with the police because they need to ask me few questions as scared as I was I followed them. Too late before I realized they are bringing me to the Mental Hospital. Still escorted by 2 policemen they were able to drag me to that hell. My hands and feet were tied in the bed and they injected something to me. I’m scared of needles that’s why I’ve talked myself to stay calm and make it look like I am already aware of what they are insisting to me that I am sick. So I stopped shouting and cursing my mom and behave well thinking that way, they let me loose but I stayed in that position up to sunrise with the bonds. I started thinking it was just Hollywood they just want to see if I know how to act by bringing me there. It was an immersion so I’ll know how it really feels to be in there. It’s part of my initiation to be a Hollywood Star. Fortunately that same morning we went home. (My mom stayed with me the whole time.) We both realize how scary it is in an asylum. They just let people roam around in the same room with me and they are all acting like normal people but some looks like just too eager to have new people there. You can’t really tell the difference whether they are normal or not. They seem just like the other normal people I know that has ADHD and seeking out some more attention.

Finally, my mom had brought me to a neurologist who is sympathetic enough about my condition. I was able to share to him everything that I went through and he told my mom “Why she had let people injected me that substance?” I thought it had made me weak. My super powers are already gone because of that. Now that I’m afraid that they will bring me again to asylum I started to take my medicines. There are several that I have to take 3 times each day, pretty expensive the highest is worth $6 in our country which is multiplied by 50 in our currency. So that’s 300 multiplied by 3 since it’s prescribed 3x a day plus the other drugs too. Plus some more extra prescriptions since the primary meds have their side effects so we need other prescription for the side effects as well. The $6 med stops the voices in my head (but made me stiff like a walking zombie literally), those feelings that you are like in The Truman Show, yep that movie. You feel like you’ve been surrounded by cameras from birth to present. They are even in the toilets while you’re taking a bath, when you’re sleeping, they’re everywhere. I had to take showers with clothes on and change with towels on. Then finally I’ve learned to accept that people are watching me and it’s just natural to be naked inside the bathroom so I was learning and adapting to the situation. My inhibitions are gone and I’m enjoying the attention.

Then it literally felt that the cameras are no longer there. I slowly emerge to the realization that it was all hallucinations. Slowly the voices in my head that kept asking me questions and telling me how I should act disappear. All was left is literally a tabula rasa. I didn’t know anything, felt like I was a new born. It was frustrating sitting in front of a computer and not knowing what to do with the mouse and patiently I tried to relearn everything and was thankful that I am a fast learner. I read a lot and practice writing and speaking again because it seems I lost my voice.

Life After The First Episodes

After a few months I was well already. No one can even tell that I am schizophrenic. I gained 5 kilo because of the meds but after that I stopped the medications. I’m already well I don’t need them anymore. I got a job in a State College for 1 semester got tired and decided to go to the big city. Got to work in a top Company and started living healthy. Walking has been my exercise, I started learning how to commute, less on the cab rides and discover every corner of the city streets by walking to work and I usually go Malling to exercise some more my feet, my eyes and my money. LOL. I ate salad most of the time, pancakes for breakfast, some steak on weekends and was able to lose weight. I live as an independent woman and my experience brought some good things to my life. It taught me how to be confident, truthful to myself, strong and fight adversities. I’m such a workaholic and some days I’m having trouble sleeping and thinking about my work kept me up all night, I just love it that I’m looking forward doing it every day. What more can I ask for my life is already perfect that I’m away from that sickness with good lessons learned.
The 2nd Episodes

So I was living my dream life when all of a sudden 2 years after my first job in the State College while I was in the City without any medication too. I started feeling weird. Feels like vomiting but nothing comes out every time I try to let it out. My co-workers started giving me that strange look and I’m hearing people talking that I might be pregnant. My neighbors back in my space we’re starting to change. They’ve seemed all friendly but now all they want from me is money. And the caretaker of the building I’m staying was a pervert, he’s probably peeping while I’m in the shower. The voices started popping again and this time they are telling me that I might be God because I haven’t committed anything wrong all throughout my life. I heard this too from the asylum patients when I was there for a night and so I have doubted this. But the proof are too strong and the voices on my head tells me I should do something bad to stop people from believing that I am God if not they are going to crucify me. The best solution for that is to have sex. Yes, sex is bad so I have to do it with anyone and the more the better. But I couldn’t do that I have my faith and my belief but no you should or else you’ll be crucified to death.
My mom and my youngest sister visited me that Christmas and found out that I am sick again. But thought it’s still fine. Since they can no longer force me to do what they want they just ask me to stay with a distant relative who can take care of me. She is a nice old lady, a divorcee with 2 kids and a Regional Trial Court judge as a profession plus a University teacher. I stayed in her condo along with her son and a niece she’s supporting the schooling to be a nurse so just the right person to look out for me. I stayed there for almost a month and when they’d realized that I’m already becoming violent (I think this is the worst sign my mom informed them that they already need to bring me home) they are going to call my mom in the province.

I’ve argued with the security of the condominium, smashed all the things on the lobby desk, slapped the face the chief security and ranting stupid words in what appears like in a native British tongue and accents. I’ve put on make-up, dressed sexy, wore spaghetti straps and disguised it as a simple sleeveless by hiding it through my long hair and going to work in a nice platform shoes without any jacket. To think it’s freezing cold in our office, the mirrors are actually foggy when you look at it outside the building but who cares.

This was the most obvious of the events that happened that if one can see me they’ll need to think twice if I am normal because there’s something like a hint that’s giving me away. I look sophisticated enough with nice clothes, shoes, make-up but you’ll find me talking to myself in public. Once I was in the high-end mall and I chose to stay in the 2nd floor balcony overlooking the resto and cafes talking to Tyra Banks. Yeah, it’s funny but we’re chit chatting right there only in my mind but my answers to her are loud enough because I could hear that she’s on the speaker talking to me. There are a lot of famous people I’ve talked to and they’re saying that they’ve been encouraging me to come out and speak out about having a multiple personality because it’s very rare and I’m already a Guinness world record holder for that. I know how it feels like to be interviewed by Oprah along with Bush in a French restaurant with me sitting there and them on a high-tech projector that their images as life-like talking to me in real-time. Maybe when people noticed that I’m actually talking solo they thought I’m just a strange foreigner on a business call over the phone with a little Bluetooth earpiece that’s covered by my hair so it seems I was just fine.
My Aunt Judge told my mom that I spent the nights singing in the balcony with the construction workers for the new condo in front as my audience and begging for some more singing with applauses for me. (This is embarrassingly true and not part of the hallucinations). Along with my mom are my cousins and one of the trusted neighbors in the province who held me in my bed and injected that substance again. The 2nd time they’ve done that to me. And afraid that they might bring me to the asylum again I calm down. They rented the ambulance from our province to the city and it took us 8 hours to go back home while on the trip I kept telling the driver to bring me to the airport because the Hollywood people are already waiting for me there.

The Recovery

Amazingly right after a month of the same medications as before I’m already fine, I was able to apply for a new job and after 2 more months I was working already. Just like before no one can ever tell what I’ve been through. Though this time the doctor made sure that I needed maintenance so I did. Everything was fine. Got promoted after 6 months and was transferred to another location far away from home. When I was finally there I stopped taking meds but it was fine nothing happened. Then I decided to resign so return back home to the main company and file my resignation. Go back to the big city and found a new job again in one of the top international companies in our country and there goes my life as a yuppie. Stubborn as I am still not taking meds I’ve spend my money to leisure, shopping, gimmicks, drinking spree and I’ve enrolled in an exclusive gym. I spent 5 hours per day in the gym right after work wasn’t able to get the right amount of sleep and then the same story goes on. The voices reappear this time with a different plot for a story more like Hollywood romance movies but because I am already aware about it I kept questioning the truth and asking for proof. Like Anon User said you have to learn to mistrust your own judgment and perceptions. And it’s harder for me because I have all the senses of hallucinations. I can hear voices so I ask if it’s real I should see it, when I am already looking at it, I must feel it and yes I was able to have all that so it was so hard not to be convinced by the voices in my head with all of these evidence presented to me.

But God was still caring for me. When I was about to commit suicide my family came with our old van as their service. (They are already aware that I am traumatized seeing an ambulance) They told me that the HR called them and said that I had a break down at work. Yes, I was fired because I started arguing with the customers and when I was coached about this all I can say is that my younger sister who is already dead at that time was sabotaging my work. I heard her voice in the recording not mine and it was rude, it’s impossible for me to be that rude plus that voice speaking in there isn’t too British in her accent so it’s not me obviously.
Then I went home with my family knowing that the real prince of England will marry me soon. (Darn stupid to believe this, right?) I certainly leave some of the details for this story because it’s really pretty lunatic of me to believe on this and I don’t know where the hell my mind get that idea because I’m really not attracted to the Windsors and I needed to be careful with my thoughts because people can read them and are even able to guess exactly what’s on my mind right at every moment.

The Final Recovery

It seems the longer without meds the worst it gets to recover. That’s almost 9 months without meds and the recovery this time was slow maybe because we switched to a cheaper remedy. For the 1st month I’ve taken all the meds from 2 doctors. The usual expensive meds plus the injection, it came into my senses that I am actually making my mom spend her fortune on my meds that’s why even though I’ve phobia on needles I’ve agreed to prefer it to save some money. The savings is pretty much high because I only need one shot once a month and that’s $6 per month, pretty cheap huh? And I’ve learned to overcome my fear of those damn needles.
The Bad Catch

Yes it was cheap but the side effects are not. It is a downer almost swiped away my emotions. I was a living zombie. I wake up, eat, sleep, eat, sleep, eat, and sleep. I try to get a little life by using the internet but only a few minutes sitting there makes me uncomfortable already. Focus is scarce. I need to sleep to help me calm and stop my mind from running miles. No more hallucinations but my brain is tiring itself thinking of a lot of things that I don’t have control of which makes me more depress. I started eating a lot and I guess just around 3 months I was able to almost double my weight. And all the confidence I’ve gained from the previous experience was down to zero. I started to pray of death because I feel so useless. I wanted to work but I can’t since I have acquired the short attention span for things. I can’t get out that much because what happened is after an hour outside my head starts to spin and I feel dizzy and have to hurry back home. Home seemed to be the only place I am immune to those kind of attacks. I didn’t feel anything when I’m at home.
The Life I am Living

Although after 4 months of the last episode I was able to get an online job as an article writer because I was getting better on focusing and was very determined to live a normal life I still didn’t succeed so I just stopped working since I have problems with my moods and my general view on day-to-day basis. To have at least something new in my life I lived in different places, traveling back and forth to my aunt’s house, to my sister’s and to my mom’s. Everybody just let me do anything and everything I want. I’m very thankful that I have a supportive family.

At my aunt’s I’m busy blogging, chatting or surfing the web, eat, sleep, discuss spirituality and yoga with my cousin or relax at the roof top or spend my time in the mini grocery store, help with photocopying or encoding important papers with pay of course.

At my sister’s I spend the day sleeping and when I’m tired of sleeping I simply go to the Souvenir Shop/café/restaurant to eat, talk with the customers mostly deans, professors, parents or students of the nearby schools or go to the boutique choose clothes that I like then bring it home for free. (Mostly I got the freebie from the 2nd hand garment store not in the boutique but I got bags from there).

Then now, I’m finally like staying only in one place that’s in my mom’s house. I was really very determined to have a normal life so we stop the injections and as I said I’m just taking food supplements almost 6 months now. I’m still sane nothing is really happening. If ever voices starts popping out again I’m fully aware already and with a slightest hint of possible hallucinations I’ll immediately inform my mom. I finally decided to take on a job and slowly adjusting to it making sure I will not be stress that much.

The good thing about it is I finally appreciate being home. I like where I live now it’s a suburb compare to the hectic condo life in the big city. It’s more peaceful and I’m already in touch with my peaceful side. I’m no longer a complex person, I’m simpler now. I used to be a little of this and that but now the real me is emerging. I am more of a loner, I can spend days, weeks inside without the need of going out but I still go out and chill with friends but only on special occasions and sometimes I surprise myself for still having that people skill that no one would ever know what happened to me. I started blogging again and my socialization has been net-based since most of the people I know are already working abroad and they’re asking me when I will join them.

The answer is as much as I would like to but I can’t because my mom needs a companion here which in truth it’s the other way around.

I’m not European that’s why when I’m sick people are shock why suddenly I speak like a native, I can read other languages too and translate it (however this isn't too reliable because I don’t know if that’s the real meaning of what I’ve understood) and yes, I’m more intelligent and process information better than usual plus the confidence is usually super high that I was able to partake in the same gym classes with local celebrities looking them straight in the eye even in shower rooms and especially in the sauna.

I got to experience having multiple personalities like 3 souls dwelling in one body simultaneously (me & 2 others). The other half does a different thing from the other half. Sometimes the boy is more dominant so I would wear something boyish, other times it’s the woman so I look more sophisticated and then the childish one who likes dresses and ponytails. I’ve experienced this in the first episodes (13 personalities) and the recovery (me & the prince). Usually I’m just the spectator but I take control when there’s something bad or foolish that the others wanted to do.

There are bottled feelings and problems that started from childhood and other issues too. The root of the evil is just a little light on those issues.

Some people might say it’s better to be crazy because you’re escaping reality and they didn’t know what they are doing that’s actually not true. In fact you are there inside alive and fighting for the truth. You are aware of every details that’s happening in the real world and the world inside your head and it’s much more difficult because you have to connect everything and differentiate which is the real truth and which is the make-believe and it’s making it more difficult when through coincidences the two worlds intertwined and coincide with each other and there is no way to tell which is which. And still hold on to that truth whichever they have figured out it is making them look like crazy people in a normal’s point of view. Imagine it like having a headphone with 3 to 5 radio stations you’re listening to 1 is AM, 2 is FM, 3 Nascar, 4 is your family and friends special station and 5 is your work as undercover detective while you are just sitting somewhere and everything is perfectly normal except Nicole Richie just popped out of that little wormhole and walked past you and if you ask if magic is real David Blaine is there and for a proof coins popped out out of nowhere (but I forgot to pick them up). How about romance? You’ll get to kiss a pillow and taste and feel it like a real kiss in the mouth, you’ll take showers together and give back rubs and you’ll get gifts from them when you go to restaurants and shopping malls you can grab anything because someone had paid all of it for you or you own the whole place already (even in hallucinations romance department is a trouble for me, I was thankful that I have a lot of pride that I don’t take enormous free gifts from people and every time there’s a voice in my head saying “Take it, it’s for you, it’s free” I still insist on paying or else I might have ended up in jail and insisting that I am the owner of that Mall). Plus you are fully aware that you are being monitored through a satellite so you have to be careful of the things you do and you’re thoughts are being read by people, it’s screaming over the whole place in a built-in speaker on your head with the microchip in your body.

I intently memorized everything that happened to me on the thought that I may need to provide a detailed story to the court in case I wanted to finally sue my family for starting this conspiracy. I want to win it by telling everyone that I am aware of all the stupid things, every detail of it and I can tell it to them in any other way they want like they’re viewing slideshows on a presentation or documentaries. However there are some events that I wasn’t aware like the rude call responses on my work, it seems that the other souls had totally took over my body which makes me feel like I didn’t exist that time, I’m somewhere else or I was asleep. But that was very rare I seldom let them took over.

If it will be summed up as a movie it’s a combination of Inception, A Beautiful Mind, The Black Swan, Joan of Arc, The Prince & Me, Babel, Confessions of a Shopaholic and of course The Truman Show. And lots of other side issues and reality shows.

Through this experience I have learned that I am a real good person. I was able to experience all the things people wanted like fame, money and power (at least the thought that I have all of that) and I was able to remain humble, good-natured (despite the few violent reactions which are very dignified because of the deliberate causes in my head) and my faith in God never falter. It was like a test and I think I’ve passed with flying colors.

I prefer to use episodes because the story happened back to back to back to back, Anon user already described most of it so I’m just sharing an elaborate view of my experience. Please bear with me if this seems to be long but this is just the summary.",schizophrenia
10,"I have to disagree with some of the other answers on here, at least with regard to my own case.
I am referring to the idea specifically that your voices have to be believed since they are coming from you, and further that it is impossible to reason with someone hearing the voices.
I did not automatically agree with my voice. The main thing he had going for him in terms of credibility was that he was undeniably there yelling in my head. Not like a mirage or something that would go away if you didn't pay attention to it. But also, the voice had odd properties that at first made me believe it was being caused by someone operating a technological device. Specifically:
you know how sometimes someone says something like a catch phrase or new word and it takes time to catch on to the meaning? He did that - specifically he kept saying he was going to put my loved ones in the sidewalk. He later explained this meant melting them with acid and washing them down the drain. At first I had no clue what he was talking about. I thought maybe he meant he had them arrested and on the ground outside, but there was no sidewalk outside my apartment.
The guy knew facts that I didn't consciously like the end year of the vietnam war (He was supposedly an ex-marine at the time).
It was attaching itself to other noises, in a sense becoming the noise while still being able to sound nothing like the source noise. If I took a shower, but then turned the water off or stopped a previously running car engine, the voice temporarily stopped and seemed to take time to adjust. If I drowned out a source of sound with louder sound, the voice temporarily stopped. Rapidly changing sounds like music and human voices blocked out the voices temporarily. Listening to white noise allowed the voice to become louder than anything else.
While the voice was present, I had the ability to hear my own thoughts loudly as an actual voice. Those thoughts did not have to sound like my own voice either, they could sound like a sci fi effect (Dalek voice from Dr. Who) or even a chorus when I felt like I was in the right. I could also take ownership of his voice mid thought, and redirect it into saying anything I wanted. However, he would just yell over whatever I was saying at that point with a new thought.
The voice had a repetitive quality to it, to where he would often repeat the same phrase over and over for a while. When he did it a certain way, the thought would get stuck on repeat even while he was saying other things. My own thoughts could get stuck the same way, and he told me at one point that it was going to give me a seizure if he could get enough thoughts to stick on repeat like that. For a while, we played a game where I tried to slow down and stop the thoughts on repeat while he was making them, which has harder the faster it was repeating. However no matter how many thoughts were on repeat nothing bad actually happened and listening to a loud noise reset everything or at least made the repeating thoughts sound much farther away.
At one point, I heard a loud tv fuzz sounding noise that got really loud in my head, and then eventually popped. At another point, the voice kept jerking my leg right before I went to sleep and then screamed that it wasn't going to let me sleep. (I didn't for like 5 days during my episode).
A few pieces of circumstantial evidence seemed to support the idea that the voice was real. I told a cop I was receiving death threats and she refused to help me, which the voice then made a big deal about. Right before I drove my car off a mountain at 70 mph, a few cars positioned themselves oddly around me and the one in front was a tow truck. To it's side was a motorcycle rider who motioned as this was happening. Other people seemed to be watching, talking about, or reacting to me and my situation, but thinking this was pretty normal for me even before the episode.
On the other hand there were things that made it less likely it was real, specifically:
The voice changed identity several times. At first it was my ps3 playing music from the actual box by itself, then it was a loudmouth black lady trying to make fun of me, then it was a texan fbi agent, then a persian gang (with multiple voices), then a state employed felon, then a neighbor, then this guy I knew that was dating an ex, but mostly it was the fbi agent. It did this in a way that did not seem absurd, by changing slowly in concert with the topic of conversation. The voice just played this off as intentional misdirection.
The two main themes of the voice where ridicule and imminent death. It was always telling me that I was about to get raided by the fbi or shot at any moment, but nothing ever happened. It kept threatening loved ones saying it would be worse for them if I tried to contact them instead of just killing myself. Once or twice it claimed to have someone there torturing them. Later in the hospital, I talked to my family members who it told me were dead and I honestly believed they were computer generated voices.

Most of the things that made it seem real are explainable in hindsight, such as maybe I knew the referenced facts the voice brought up subconsciously. Maybe his initiative was the same as when you suddenly think of something funny to say. It's properties were probably neuroscience related.
However to this day I maintain that I wasn't being unreasonable by considering the possibility the voice was real. Especially since the technology to do similar things to someone actually exists.
As I said, the whole time the voice was threatening loved ones, telling me it was going to kill me, and occasionally saying that I was going to a prison. The whole experience was accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of dread and anxiety that is very uncharacteristic for me.
Even though I have had many pleasant experiences, the voice was systematically breaking down every course of action I might take by saying my side projects would never work, no new person would ever want to talk to me, I should just give up and die. (That is the short version, he tried to breakdown every thought I had with subversive ridicule for 5 days straight)
The episode ended with me driving off a mountain at 70 mph. The car flipped down the side of the mountain diagonally, and some how the whole thing was trashed except a little pocket for the driver. My face was fractured a little but not really noticeably, I got a few scars, and one of my vertebrae had compression fractures. A little pain from that and in my sternum is all I have left. They gave me geodon in the hospital and that stopped the voices dead in their tracks.
Prior to this I had tried to poke a hole in my carotid artery with a pen, and rake out my wrist veins longwise with a key chain. I broke skin on my throat and left a scar on my arm, but I couldn't apply enough force to succeed I guess out of fear. This was after the cop refused to help me, as up to that point I was merely considering the possibility that the situation was real. When I heard that I suddenly thought it was real and that I had to commit suicide to avoid torture and protect my loved ones. The vein thing left a scar, but it migrated a bit so I can play it off as being caused by something else.
Very often the voice tried to imply that nearby people were agents of the voice's group, but I resolved that I would not hurt anybody unless they blatantly attacked me first. This was hard because the voice kept saying that by then it would be too late and I would wake up in a torture chamber. That is why I was driving; it's harder to subdue something with that much kinetic energy. But in the end I drove off the cliff rather than risk hurting the motorcyclist or any of the other drivers when I got boxed in just in case it was just a coincidence. I was sure enough to kill myself but not to risk hurting anyone else.
The car hit a mound of dirt and the windshield cracked, but then I blacked out. I ""woke"" on a chopper, although I couldn't really see anything until I was tended to in the trauma room. The voice was still going full blast from the second I woke up, until they put me on geodon once they realized what was wrong with me and my family showed up.
I quickly got off the medicine when I left the hospital though. Up to a few weeks after I heard voices from time to time, but I took them far less seriously. It got really bad once, and even my reserve meds did not help. In response, I got drunk and the voices went away. I think the whole episode was caused by alcohol withdrawal, as in I was drunk for too long and then sobered up too fast.
I am not on meds and haven't heard any voices for a few months now. I never had any visual hallucinations. I am also 30 which is unusually late for someone to develop schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
11,"Imagine being awake night after night(around 5 days straight this particular time) with a repetitive voice telling you to “keep this one alive.” Without any explanation as to whose voice it is, you don’t quite recognize it, but you have a few people that you can compare it to, you may or may not have ever heard. The sun starts to come up, you turn on the today show or the morning news like you always do, and for some reason, this morning all of the news reporters seem to be talking to you directly. Everything they’re saying you can manipulate in someway to have specific relevance to your life personally. It’s terrifying and unnerving and you add details throughout the entire report through coincidence and commonality. So freaked out you switch it to the music station, the one that has no videos, and just plays the music itself. You start to believe some magical force (God if you will) controls shuffle, and random, and it’s projecting specific songs to you in an ordered message. Frantic over its meaning you focus on that for countless hours, alone, so you don’t miss any of the “special message” you’re being transmitted. After becoming overwhelmed with that, you get an extreme “exhibitionary” urge to not wear any clothes. Luckily, you live out in the country, with no close neighbours, so you feel like it might be soothing to lay in a bay window to absorb the sun. But your thought process is becoming much deeper than that, you feel like some sort of human photosynthesis or lack thereof is a part of “the problem”. (And when I say problem, I mean the overwhelming feeling of dread, apocalyptic scenarios, and religious paranoia. For me, personally).
The next step to fixing “the problem” could only be to go outside naked, right? Because, of course, it is! You proceed to prance around your country property stark naked, without any inhibitions what-so-ever. After wearing yourself out (barely), you decide to sit in silence. And you try to just sit, and enjoy the sounds of the wind and nature around you. Right before you drift off to sleep, for what would be the first time in days, you’re suddenly startled by a voice seeming to come from the heavens, sounding exactly like your father, declareing that “it’s all a God damned personal joke.”
This was all things I experienced as someone with Schizophrenia (Schizoaffective disorder).That was all extended over a period of 3+ weeks, I had already been misdiagnosed ADHD as a child, and biploar at that point, and was already on a handful of medications that didn’t help (obviously).
I hope this helps to shine some light on how it can be for almost an entire month of fully on-set symptoms and triggers.
I would like to add, that Thorazine and Seroquil did have many positive benefits as far as medications. I couldn’t handle the UV sensitivity that Thorazine caused, so I switched to Seroquil and had good results for 4 straight years. That being said, I’ve been off medication for over a year now, for the first time since 2012, and I feel like I woke up, like I’m free to make my own choices, and all around be myself. Being able to even DECIDE to STOP taking medication has been a right ripped from me many times. Court ordered meds, and parents who think a doctors word is God-like. At 30, I can honestly say I feel like I won the battle. And it really is, just a God damned personal joke, that only I know the punchline.
If you took the time to read this, I appreciate it very much.

12,"Yes I do. That labels me “crazy.”
I get told a lot, “You don't seem like you have schizophrenia.” “You don't look like you have it.”
When I'm alone with my mind - is when it's the worst. If I'm not on meds? Forget it, It's just a downward spiral. Everyone's out to get me. What was that?? Omg, they are talking about me. Do I smell? Some of the agonizing thoughts I have daily. That's when I am taking my meds..
Now without them?(aka a psychosis) My family hates me. My daughter is going to forget me.. There are bugs everywhere in my house, in my hair, in my clothes, etc. *Buys bug foggers and lice shampoo* Falls into a deep depression. Lays on the couch for days at a time without eating or showering. *Cuts up furniture because people are inside it.* *Pulls outlets out from the walls because I'm being watched.*
To live with it? It's absolutely awful, every day is a struggle and being sober every day is a struggle. I'm fighting 2 demons at the same time but I refuse to let them win.
I came home this past weekend from a long-term rehab program. I got to see my wonderful daughter. When I'm with her everything is right in the world. I forget all about my schizophrenia and addiction. I am 4 1/2 months sober today.",schizophrenia
13,"My biological mother was schizophrenic along with her younger brother. Fortunately, she took off when I was only five months old. It was my paternal grandmother who cared for me and my sister who was a year older. At seven, my dad remarried and off we went to live with him and a new lady we were told to call mom. At age thirteen, I was removed from that home as my parents were charged with child abuse and neglect. Most of my remaining teenage years were spent in foster care or living with my newly found mother and step father. I met her for the first time when I was ten. There were a few visits, but nothing long enough where I noticed anything unusual. At fourteen I went to live with her full time. I learned quickly she was a heavy drinker. She spent each evening out drinking with her husband. When they got home all hell broke loose. She called my sister and I every fowl name in the book and accused both of us of having an affair with her husband. It was disgusting and scary. I remember standing in the kitchen for a couple hours sometimes forced to pretend we lived in her world. I thought all of it was due to her drinking. This lasted about three months. My sister kept running away and finally they just put us on a plane back to Michigan. Back in foster care, my sister became a runaway. I had a choice to become a ward of the court until I was eighteen, or go back to live with her. I chose my mom. Afterall, she was my real mother. Nothing had changed though. I learned to run to my bedroom when I’d hear the cars pull in and pretend I was asleep. She’d still open my bedroom door and lay into me just as if I were awake and sitting up listening to her. Of course, I have story after story of my eventful time while living there.
Years later, I had my own little girl and we went to visit. My mother’s condition had gotten worse. She was so unpredictable even moment to moment sometimes. I tried to make the best of it and felt terrible that I put my daughter in this environment. She was only six. Well, out of the blue my mom wanted to take pictures of us in the back yard. She became more flustered by the second. While standing in the yard, my daughter casually picked up a stone she saw laying in the grass. My mother lost it! She was mortified that someone was stealing rocks from her yard. She lectured my poor daughter endlessly and said the craziest things to her. You may wonder why I wouldn’t have just left. Well, you could say fear seized us. She was truly unpredictable and to try to help things not escalate, I did whatever she wanted.
A day or so later, I had to plan out our escape to leave her house. She wasn’t going to let us go. My mom stood next to the knife drawer in the kitchen opening and shutting it. She had literally just finished watching a movie where the mother killed the daughter. She was yelling at us about things that made no sense. She didn’t want us to leave the room. But when the time was right I said I needed to take my daughter to the bathroom. Instead, I grabbed our luggage and we ran to our car as fast as we could! She ran out yelling after us. I tore out of the driveway so fast I couldn’t believe it. I was so afraid of her, but also afraid I might run her over, but there was no way I was about to stop. I needed to protect my daughter. We got away, thanks be to God! That was our last visit. I mentioned in the beginning that her younger brother was schizophrenic too. He had committed suicide several years earlier when he was off of his medication. He put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off. Almost ten years ago now, my mother also committed suicide by overdosing on prescription drugs.
Strangely, I always loved my mother. I never blamed her for leaving my sister and I. I knew she wouldn’t have done it if she felt there was a better option. I felt sorry for my mom when I realized how mentally ill she was. Why? Because I suffer from depression. It’s something I can’t help. I’ve been a prisoner to it most of my life. My mom had to have felt the same way. To say that life isn’t fair is an under statement. We have to play the cards we’re dealt. That’s for sure.",schizophrenia
14,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago. My first episode I believed I was Maitreya, the 5th reincarnation of Buddha. Shortly before that, I had discovered the notion of enlightenment and believed myself to be so. I saw signs in everything I came across. The colors red and yellow, whenever they appeared, verified my belief. The number 47, also. I barely slept and my sex drive was higher than normal. I spent an entire day in NYC with my dad walking around like I was the savior. Several people took notice of my behavior and treated me like I was a king (no joke). This only added to my delusion.
Schizophrenia, when experienced through grandiose delusions, feels like the best drug you could ever take. You feel like a God and that nothing can harm you. Your mind is active the entire day. Everything is urgent. When I was finally taken to the hospital, I believed the doctors would recognize my status and fly me to the Pope so we could plan world peace. You're totally inside the realm of your mind. Reality ceases to exist. Whatever you think becomes a reality.
Other people with schizophrenia experience the opposite, they hear violent voices and convinced they are being followed. Think of nightmares. When you wake up, you're still in it.
I no longer carry the delusion that I'm Buddha, but once in a while I think about it when I'm really down. I believe having grandiose delusions is defense mechanism against low self-esteem for people prone to schizophrenia. Medication definitely helps. I can no longer feel the highs that come with my grandiose beliefs. It's a blessing. I've done many stupid things in my schizophrenic state.",schizophrenia
15,"I just realized, after reading Anon's answers, that I know much less than I thought I did about this condition. My cousin has Schizophrenia, but he lives in a mental institution. Although he can display above average intelligence at times, he in no way would ever be able to function outside of a supervised facility.
He has a different walk that is apparent at once. He does not swing his arms, and leans back as he's going forward, constantly checking behind himself to see if anyone is following, or if he's dropped something.
He carries with him a bag of papers at all times, and these are of vital importance to him. The papers are dozens of old TV Guides, napkins from fast food places, menus, junk mail, etc. He knows every single scrap that's in there, and if anything is ever missing, it is cause for much ado.
He has virtually no self-awareness about hygiene, and many times has to be talked into taking a bath, combing his hair, and brushing his teeth. He makes no attempt at being discreet about expelling gas or using the bathroom. On one unfortunate occasion, while he was visiting my house with his mother, he defecated in my bathroom while hovering over the toilet seat, because he was taught by his mother that public toilet seats have germs, but was not able to differentiate between the bathroom of a family member and a public toilet. I found excrement splattered from his standing position all over my walls, toilet seat, cabinet, floor, and towels. The toilet itself was literally stuffed above the rim with an entire roll of toilet paper, which he used in an attempt to clean himself, and human waste - it was not able to be flushed, and I had to find a way to remove the bulk of the tissue to get it working, again. He thought nothing of this whatsoever, and felt no embarrassment at all.
His medications, I believe, are the reason he feels physically sick all the time. He gets fearsome headaches and dizzy spells, and often has stomach upset and high anxiety.
Sometimes carrying on a conversation with him can be quite enjoyable, but that is rare. Most times he is apt to constantly repeating the same set of phrases over and over again, and speaking as fast as an auctioneer in the process. There are times when he rambles incoherently for hours without stopping, all the while squinting his eyes closed and sticking his fingers in his ears to block out as much sensory input as possible.
He has accused everyone in the family, at one time or another, of being in disguise and trying to trick him. And, one Thanksgiving, in the middle of dinner, he burst out in a very angry tyrant about my dead mother, shouting one obscene misconstrued fact after the other in a highly insulting and greatly hurtful manner.
When he eats, his attention is only on getting the food inside of his mouth as fast as he can. Even when the dish is empty, he will swipe his finger across it numerous times, licking it afterward, making certain that every crumb and drop of sauce in consumed. When he drinks something, he will turn the empty glass upside down, and look up into it, then run his finger inside the glass and suck on his finger, then tap the bottom of the empty glass while he holds it over his open mouth, just in case he missed a drop.
When he is particularly angry, he will beat on his chest as he's making direct eye contact with whomever he is angry at, and scream many threats of physical harm, while at the same time his face will turn red and tears will form in his eyes, which sometimes turns into a crying fit that chokes him and makes him throw up.
I've noticed that he will sometimes 'transform' his character into that of someone he's seen on television, such as Archie Bunker, taking on the facial expressions, hand gestures, and exaggerated mimicking of conversations from that TV show.
He understands clearly that he is different, and has continually, over many years, referred to his ailment as a 'birth defect'.
His handwriting displays an incredible slant with the letters extremely tall and narrow and suffocatingly close together - very, very difficult to read.
He is obsessed with getting married, and often believes that women in the family (elderly aunts, cousins, etc) are in fact engaged to him, and that their wedding will happen at some point in the future.
He has a memory that can only be matched by a computer. Not only can he tell you what main event happened on any particular day, going all the way back to his early childhood, but what everyone was wearing, what songs or TV shows were playing, what was for dinner, what the weather was, and so on. He is never wrong.
One time when I was a child, and he was still living at home with his parents (he is in his 50s now, so at the time he was only in his 20s) my mother brought me with her to visit their house. They had a very sweet cat, and when I walked in, I smiled at the cat, and he exploded, nearly striking me - in fact, lunged at me with his fist in the air - because he thought I was 'laughing at him'. We had to leave immediately, there was no calming him down.
That is what I believed all Schizophrenic people were like...until today. But with such an extreme difference in psyche between the Anons and my cousin , I have to wonder, did the doctors get it wrong - one way or the other?",schizophrenia
16,"I'm currently a clinical pharmacist intern at the Psychological/Behavioral Health unit of a hospital. The first file I studied is a 29 year old schizophrenic patient. Let me tell you what it’s like to have Schizophrenia.
My patient was admitted to the hospital for being agitated, euphoric and having hallucinations and insomnia. He actually stabbed a person 3 times and once killed a guy with his car. And the excuse he gave us for his actions was that he was mad and delusional. He is also very agressive with his family and almost killed his dad.
When we interviewed him about his marital status, he told us that he is getting married next month. Surpised, we asked him the same question the next day. This time he told us that he is searching for a wife. Now it made sense.
When we asked him if he’s ever had a traumatic event that triggered his schizophrenia, he told us that he can't remember.
Sometimes, he can't even finish a whole interview because of how agitated he gets. He once even held the chair and threw it on us. Thankfully, no one got injured.
We asked him what calms him whenever he’s angry, he said it’s when he eats KFC or Burger King. So sometimes when he’s having manic attacks, we tell him that we’re going to get him a burger from Burger King. He then smiles like a baby and calms down.
He gets anger outbursts from time to time, besides this when he’s on medication he’s calm and nice, but sometimes relapses. He is always in need to talk, walk around and have emotional support. He became best friends with the nurses (That’s their job, to make him feel safe where he is). I, as a pharmacist, sit in a locked room because these patients can be very dangerous. The only way they can communicate with me is through the glass holes.
Nurses are there whenever he needs to vent out or talk. He sometimes asks for a cigarette and most of the time he sings and listens to music. He knows every lyric to every song, he’s very smart.
Sometimes, he can't sleep at night so they give him Valium, a benzodiazepine for sedation and Promethazine plus an antipsychotic with sedative effects.
He’s not the only one on the floor. There’s around 10 others with other mental problems, so you can imagine how hard it can be on the nurses. One day, I asked the nurse how they don’t get scared since you never know when they can blow out in rage and hurt you. She told me a key thing to always remember when dealing with people, even in real life, it’s to never show them your fear towards them, even if you’re shaking from the inside. If you show them ONCE that you're afraid, they’ll always have outbursts of anger towards you. Instead, make THEM scared and show them that YOU can get angry too, that way, they’ll behave to your orders.
I'm always fascinated by such people and respect them so much. We should never forget that they are normal humans like us, and we shouldn’t treat them in any lesser way. May God be with every person who has a mental disorder.
Edit: Some people are confused on how he’s showing anger symptoms. Yes, schizophrenic patients DO get angry, and I'm glad that because of this post more people know that it’s not only about delusions and hallucinations. Psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, with subsequent hostility, may result in aggressive behavior. They have poor control of their aggressive impulses, just like Bipolar patients. I did not specify that my patient is not purely schizophrenic. He has a schizoaffective disorder with mania. It means he’s mixed schizophrenic and bipolar. Nevertheless, what I described still applies to his schizophrenic side.
Mental disorders are not the perfect application of what’s written in a book. Each patient has a different brain structure and different manifestations of symptoms. Hence, medications are individualized and personalized according to what he is showing.

17,"I'll share a bit on this question, as it's been a good long time (since 2006) since I've been on any medication for schizophrenia, and functioning normally, and spent the 5 prior years gradually weaning myself from the medication -- though I was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 20 and hospitalized 10 times over the course of 15 years. I've beat the rap!

For me, schizophrenia included:
1. Disorganization, and I followed flights of fancy.
2. Catatonia, where I'd go days without eating or drinking. This is when I'd stop taking meds, as I was not taking anything by mouth, generally ending up with a nervous breakdown and then a hospital stay.
3. Psychotic aspect, where I ""looked"" schizophrenic.
4. Poor grooming skills, alas.
5. Self-induced intoxication, where I was not on ""drugs"" but certainly my thoughts were as if I were drugged, with the filters which separate agency from actions were quite haywire. Most folks don't associate correlation with causation for thinking related to objects outside one's body, though for me this happened somewhat, and was difficult to deal with. I was not depressed, and did have self-respect, and somehow managed to follow the course of my life with courage. Most are not as lucky as I, and end up in much more difficulty. I am of a naturally spiritual bent, so the phenomena weren't completely foreign to my interests, nor was I without motivation in seeking meditative and spiritual outlets to participate in. The schizophrenics who have a more technophobic or paranoid framework certainly have an experience much, much worse than mine. I was able to devote myself to healthy diet, exercise, experiences in nature, art, schooling, teaching, and other areas which, I suppose were a gift of early successes and family resources. Schizophrenia, which was formerly called 'dementia praecox', denoted dementia with an onset before old age, and most likely related to the changes with adolescence, so a 'self-induced intoxication' as the driving force behind it, based on hormonal changes, is probably a proper way of looking at this. I'm sensitive to gluten, and various other foods, so it makes sense that there's a distinct metabolic component as well.
6. Unintelligibility, though I knew what I was on about.
7. Prejudice, from medical professionals, employers, care givers, and the general public.
8. Inspiration, since no one will make you better but yourself.
9. Danger, which is obvious.
My life has been so very interesting, and filled with such benefits as:
1. Creativity, with lots and lots of ideas and skills.
2. A sense of being a survivor, and having the gratitude which comes with that.
3. Loving relations, as any human being may have.
4. Experiences like no other, truly deep.
5. A sense of purpose, often influenced by the illness.
6. Free time, and, though I worked, first as a volunteer in several settings, including a hospital, and nonprofits, and then as a teacher (credentialed), I had much more free time than most people, time which I used to try and recover, and to learn.

I don't know how I could have been as lucky as I am, to go from being told that I will ""never recover"" by scores of people, to being a successful artist (I sell a few pieces every year), teacher (having worked under contract in adult school, and subbing in K-12, and now at university), scientist (with a provisional patent, and a few publications), father (with a daughter ""by choice,"" she, having been adopted by my friend, adopted me as a father -- though they now live far away, and I don't see them but for one month out of the year, or so), and friend to many.
Thank you so much for your interest.

18,It is a living nightmare. At first the paranoia started. I knew I was being followed everywhere I went. I wrote down license numbes. The delusions of people riding in the car with me. Namely my boyfriend who had committed suicide years before I had my first psychotic break. I started using methamphetamine because it was cheaper and better than cocaine or so I thought. At 10 and a half years of sobriety I picked up meth. I got paranoid and delusional about everything. Especially dogs. My voices would yell at me to throw my dope away because all the dogs I saw were dope sniffing dogs. I did everything my voices told me to do. I started criminal behavior at about 35. That was my 2nd phschotic break. I wound up in jail and I had no idea how things worked. I demanded an attorney and didn't know you don't have one at your arraignment. You just plead guilty or not guilty(there other pleas but they don't tell you that). It was my turn and the drug court judge asked how do you plead. Io said Your Honor I prefer to be kissed while you're fucking me. He proceeded to tell me I was incompetent to assist my own attorney( which I didn't have). He informed me I would be going State Hospital to have my competency restored. This process can last anywhere from 72 hours to 180 days. Thank God they diagnosed me paranoid schizophrenic and started medication. The schizophrenia was not caused by my meth use but it did make things worse. I went to classes at the hospital to restore my competency. The classes taught me about the laws and freedom and the constitution. I was in hospital 45 days and jail 45 days on a charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. I pleaded an Alford plea and was given time served. I took a lot of psych meds in the beginning. Some work some don't. Some are horrible. Schizophrenia presents different symptoms for different people. I gained 100 pounds . All I did was sleep and eat. I could not stand the auditory and visual hallucinations. To look in the mirror was awful. I quit taking my meds and got back on meth. I lost the weight but struggled with sleep deprivation and mal nourishment. Had another psychotic break but went to hospital instead of jail. To make a long story short I was in and put of jails and hospitals for a long time. I have used meth off and on. If I do use meth I still continue to take my psyche meds. My voices are at a tolerable level. The main one I call Satan's Messenger. He has nothing but mean and nasty things to say. The kind one I call my guardian angel. I still have pariedolia which is seeing faces in everything like trees wood carpet anything with pattern my brain will recognize faces of people or animals and the GODDAMN demons. No one else can see them. Visual hallucinations are not common for schizophrenia. Pariedolia is not a hallucination. It is a perception problem in the brain. My story is ongoing. If you suspect you may have a mental illness go see a mental health professional immediately and get yourself diagnosed. Go to several mental health professionals til you feel confident that you are heard and correctly diagnosed. Save yourself the trips to jails and institution's. If you can be honest with family or trusted friend if not share it with your Drs. Someone will get it eventually and you will get help you need. I hope this helps someone. I know part of it is funny bit it it is truly life and death. I was a danger to myself and others. I nearly died because of this terrible disease. I lost everything. My spouse my kids my job. My friends my belongings my sanity everything. You don't have to lose everything. Get help.,schizophrenia
19,"I’ll explain a day, or situations.
You wake up, it’s 3pm. Immediately in your ear, someone whispers something rather intelligible. You can’t go back to sleep with the noise, so you get up, feeling sluggish.
Walking down to the kitchen to make something to eat is painful. Someone is clanging pots but you hear it 10x louder. Among that another voice pops up, one you’re familiar with that isn’t from anyone physically within the house;
“Hit them with the pan. That’ll stop the noise.”
You’re taking the dog for a walk. The weather is a dull gray, and while you’re walking, you see a figure under one of the streetlights. You get a sinking feeling. Something about it doesn’t feel safe. You look at your dog, but they don’t seem to react to it. It’s not there when you look back, but you still feel like someone is watching you. Shadows start darting in the corners of your vision and you become agitated. You walk faster to get home.
It’s 8pm, no one is home, and you walk downstairs to grab a snack. At the base of the stairs sitting on a chair is someone you’ve never seen before; but only because you can’t quite make out any details, even though they aren’t shadowy. It’s only there for a few seconds, but when it disappears, you hear a thump from your room.
There must be something in the house.
The air feels heavy and it’s suddenly so quiet you can hear ringing in your ears. If you move, it’ll disrupt the air and whatever is there will feel that, and know your position. You’re frozen for 5 minutes at best. When you no longer hear sounds, you tip toe back of the stairs, moving as steadily as possible as to not make creaks. Something from the darkness of the living room is staring at you, you can see its eyes.
Once you make it up to your room and close the door quietly behind you, you get this “vision” that something is coming up the stairs, and you know exactly what it looks like. It’s horrible. Scratching suddenly comes from the walls around you, and within minutes it’s coming from every direction. You curl up in your bed until you either fall asleep finally or someone gets home.
You wake up in the middle of the night. Something is very off, and upon investigating your room in the dark, you notice a very opaque shadow hiding in one of the corners of the room by the ceiling. You recognize it. It’s been stalking you for months. You know you’re in danger right now.
A voice sounds from just behind you, telling you you can repel it with a mirror, for now. A chorus of voices join in, all talking at the same time. You have a mirror just below where the shadow is, and you dive for it, gazing into it. You’re not sure how that works, but it does. It disappears.
You wake up in the middle of the night, the light is already on. Something is behind your desk, peeking it’s head up to look at you. You humor it, leaning over the desk only slightly and touching its nose every time it comes up. It’s some boy, you’ve never seen, but regardless it isn’t strange to you. After a few lighthearted minutes, it disappears, but you can still feel it around. But in a few moments the ambiance turns sour. Something smacks your foot at the base of your bed. It’s there, but you can’t see it anymore. Warily, you lean back into your pillow, and the pillow beside it suddenly begins pushing in towards your face, as if to smother you.
Panicked, you shove it away and turn your side with your back to it, and suddenly it’s gone, and the light in your room is off. It was never on in the first place. You still feel cautious, and pull your covers over your head.
You’re at your psychologists office, talking like usual. He’s explaining a story of a patient once, something related to the topic, but you’re distracted by the way his face suddenly warps and glitches, for moments at a time. You’re looking at him strange, and he notices, but doesn’t pry, for now.
These are only some events that have happened to me, but I hope it gives you an idea.",schizophrenia
20,"History
I was 21 years old and experimenting with various illegal drugs including lsd, ecstasy, marijuana and amphetamine for a couple of years. I've tried cocaine although not a regular user. Being a regular smoker and alcohol user in the gaps. I was administered voluntarily although subsequently being sectioned for misbehaving to a mental psychiatric unit in Fairmile and stayed there for about 3 months, receiving medication and treatment. Being released I cannot really remember taking further medication and was predominately left to my own devices. I gave up drugs aged about 27, not including alcohol and nicotine, they were only removed from my life when I was 31, so with no further medical intervention I was left to my own devices. A couple of year ago aged 37 I went to the doctor and asked to see a specialist who subsequently prescribed Aripiprazole/Abilify an anti Psychotic for the 'undiagnosed anxiety disorder' aged 39 and a half I've now stopped and am again living my own life.
Delusions
Ha, this is what I can remember of some of the cognitive experiences I've had...
The Delivery - Early psychotic episodes occurred at a 'friends' house, high on something or other when I started to really believe I was entitled to luxury cars, just for being me. I truly thought there was going to be a delivery of vehicles arriving at my friends house any minute on the back of a car transporter. I was restlessly looking out for them through the windows. I was convinced they would be getting delivered, beyond any logical doubt.
The Road Trip - I was standing in my family home kitchen waiting for signs or signals telling me what to do, I knew I was destined for greatness and needed to follow the celestial signals to accomplish this desire. Then I walked into the living room, sometime later I went back to the kitchen and the car keys had 'miraculously' appeared. I gather the essential object necessary to accomplish my mission including a T-bag, electronic lighter, C.D, and various other innate objects totally irrelevant to anything in particular, put them in a plastic bag and ventured into the night, with the car keys. I started the car and started to follow the moon, that was the direction in which I needed to go. Unfortunately I was under the impression I was invincible as I was shrouded with god's protective embrace and continued to speed through speed cameras and navigating across lanes overtaking slower vehicles without care or consideration for reality. Subsequently, as God was watching over me, I decided nothing bad could happen and handbraked around a corner at about 70mph. The next thing I remember was an old bearded man peering through the window asking if I was o.k. - this was god himself. I recall asking the ambulance crew ""where the old man had gone?"" while they were cutting me from the wreckage. They said there was no one around, which fuelled my belief that he had simply vanished back to heaven. The car's a right off and they shut the road during rush hour to mend the telegraph pole I'd wrapped the car around. I was in Hospital for a day, I remember some friends came to visit me and I was telling them that I had been recognised on the back of a C.D's acknowledgement list as my name was there, and it was definitely me.
Telepathy - Everyone knows what I'm thinking and feeling. When I'm surrounded by people they are having an effect on my mind, perhaps this is only empathy, although my meaning of that is literal and people are actually in my mind and vice versa. The problem with people being in my mind was that they were affecting my neural network and disrupting my individuality with theirs.
The Lottery - yes I influenced the outcome of the lottery results. Unfortunately the 'correct technique' was still aloof and although I've tried to influence the outcome through telekinesis the only result I can confirm is that the colour of the balls matched the colour of the ticket. This was caused by me concentrating so hard on the ticket that my mental powers transmitted to the lottery machine and produced that result. Ongoing, I've been unable to fix the lottery results and it's been agreed that monitory values are mans creation and If I were given a hand out it would be considered cheating. I need to learn spiritual worth on its own benefits.
The T.V & Radio- I was convinced that I have caused presenter's to lose their jobs as I don't like them or their style or show by transmitted this disdain to the producers and T.V bosses. I'm convinced I had an influence on the production schedule, as shows which were extremely relevant to my secret thoughts were being aired. I would accidently interrupt the flow of presenters during live broadcasts, causing them to stutter and or forget words. I could interrupt their style of delivery to improve the tone of voice according to my personal recommendation. There was a connection through the T.V where I could feel the presenters secret thoughts and feelings. Songs on the radio are aimed at me directly.
Weather - Concentrating about the sun in a particular way made it appear, I'd convinced myself that I had influence over the weather and sometimes if the sun was shining, it was an indication that my thoughts were correct and my feelings were right. I could move the clouds with my mind, and if it was raining or overcast then I'd perhaps done something wrong or conflicting against a more positive situation.
Messiah Complex - I have literally walked into a church during a service and sat down on a pew waiting to be recognised as the second coming. I was convinced I was on this earth for a greater purpose, a higher calling, I should poses divine insight, spiritual awakening. I was waiting for my healing power to materialise so I could cure people of their ailments. Then it transpired that there are too many people to heal individually and I could not touch everyone as there is not enough time and my concept of mass healing materialised, where I had to transmit my healing energy through my mind into inanimate object for people to receive them. This progressed to basic mass communication of healing is a mental process which I can transmit to people without touching them thus saving the world from harm.
Those are the main events I've experienced during psychosis although there are a multitude of permutation expanding the parameters and possibilities I've simulated in my mind. I tried not to include the feeling and emotions experienced during this time, needless to say there've been conflicting and debilitating despair through euphoria including utter confusion, disassociation, regret and guilt.
I can conclude that it has been a rollercoaster which has enveloped my life. I've only recently convinced myself that these delusions are just that, allowing myself the ability to progress with a 'normal' mental outlook. The realisation that these phenomena were not happening was not an easy pill to swallow and a thorough self examination and mental adjustment and chemical refinement was paramount in enabling recovery. I'm currently studying BSc Psychology which I concurrently believe has helped me understand and accept my condition, gaining relevant applicable insight and knowledge to the causes of mental deterioration, subsequently allowing greater scope for recovery. Individual causes of psychosis are apparently biological, psychological and social. A breakdown in one or more of these areas can be the cause of mental health issues, the road to recovery is unique to individual circumstance and what's right for one is not necessarily right for another. I believe deciding that there is a choice and accepting there should be change are steps in the direction of contentment.",schizophrenia
21,"It is like living a nightmare, only that you are awake. Or should I say, unable to close your eyes?
Voices that are as real as a person talking next to you. They watch your every thought and action and comment on it in a good way or bad…. and it works like a chain reaction inviting more and more conversations. And all this is happening within.
In my case, things went so bizarre that I could slip into parallel realities and have conversations or experiences that never really happened.
To be watched at your soul level, can feel incredibly naked and vulnerable. Accountable for every little moment of your life.
But there is hope at the end of the tunnel.
I am in 99% recovery now and living a productive life.",schizophrenia
22,"Psychosis/schizophrenia cannot be cured.
I will have psychosis for my entire life. When I die, hopefully of old age, I will still have psychosis. I will always live with this disease of the brain.
While it cannot be cured, it can certainly be treated, and quite effectively. I am a high functioning individual with psychosis. I work 40 hours a week, I go to college and get good grades, I am technically a genius. I have a 145 IQ. I am not psychotic, I simply have psychosis.
This disease has certainly impacted my life. It's caused much stress to me and my family, caused much unnecessary heartache and has caused me to attempt suicide almost 20 times. I hurt my mother, my father, my sister, my aunt and my grandfather. I believed delusions that caused me to stay out of contact with my friends and isolate myself. I believe that people could read my mind and control my thoughts. But despite all of this, I am still a champion. A warrior. A hero. I've made everyone who knows me proud by never giving up and always persisting like a true warrior.
Psychosis is part of me that most people will never know about unless I tell them. People are surprised when I tell them. “You seem normal to me.” That's because I am. Nothing about me is out of the ordinary. Sure, I get super hypomanic and really talkative. But I am an expert at social situations, at reading people and my surroundings. I am very smart. I set the record for the fastest Mectron setup time at work at 22 minutes. It takes most people 45 minutes to an hour to setup a machine. I am very high functioning. And I've certainly treated my schizophrenia well.
I take 600mg of trylaptal, 15mg of zyprexa and 25mg of vistaril a day. I manage my symptoms well. I only occasionally hear voices, and honestly I really enjoy being manic and euphoric. I wouldn't trade what I have for the world. I accept and love who I am. I am Nickolas and I am a survivor.",schizophrenia
23,"Make an appointment with your Primary Care Provider and have a complete physical examination including blood work, EKG, thyroid level etc. Talk to your doctor about why you feel you have schizophrenia, specifically about any new or odd thinking or experiences you may be having. Usually it is diagnosed in the late teens or early twenties and there is a genetic component. Someone in your immediate family or extended family may have a psychotic illness. Your doctor ( PCP) will make you a referral to see a Mental Health Provider.
Attend the appointment made with the Mental Health Professional. They will want to spend at least 1 hour with you the first time. Bring to the appointment any medications you have been taking, even over the counter. Be truthful about alcohol and drug use, especially cannabis. THC is one of the most harmful triggers for psychosis in a brain under 25 years old. Know your medical history and as much family medical history as you can find out.
Follow the psychiatrist orders. If he or she prescribes medication take it exactly as ordered. Give yourself a break from any stressful situations you have going on. Stress makes symptoms worse so your job is to maintain as much of a stress free lifestyle as possible. Take one day at a time. Eat nutritious protein packed food, veggies and fruits.
Exercise at least 3 times per week by getting outside. Maintain a good sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time. If you have to take an hour nap in the afternoon that is fine.
Surround yourself with a good support system who understand how important it is you lead a healthy life. Please consider a counselor or therapist to be part of your support team. Contact NAMI which is a world wide organization to support illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression. They have extensive resources.
Use dim lighting, do not listen to loud harsh violent music or read any books such as those. Play cards, put puzzles together, read books that you enjoy, journal your thoughts, keep interested in pleasant experiences.

It's like having a constant stream of ideas, stories, and insights. I've always been a creative person, I can write books within a day, I just need a topic but this has amplified my abilities.
I'm looking for someone who can understand, support, and collaborate with me. Someone who can help me harness this creativity and turn it into something meaningful. I believe I have a lot to offer, but I need someone to help me unlock my potential.
I'm open to anything, whether it's daily chats, phone calls, or working on projects together. I'm eager to learn and grow, and I hope you're willing to join me on this journey.
I want my day to begin with a cup of coffee and wrap up with a glass of wine, all while wearing a big smile.
I wish to wake up with happiness shining on my face and joy filling my heart, free from worries about money or where to stay.
I want friends who understand my vulnerabilities and value me for who I am, not just for what I can offer. Sometimes, a deep friendship is far more valuable than any material possession.
I know this might sound unusual, but I'm truly desperate. I'm hoping you can see the value in what I have to offer. Please, give me a chance.
I promise that if you accept me today, I will remain loyal to you for the rest of my life. I will always protect you and never let you down; I will be your shadow and ensure you stay safe.
I'm 29 years old, but I feel like I have the wisdom and experience of someone much older. I've been blessed with a unique perspective and a creative mind that can generate ideas at an incredible pace. I can write books, develop business plans, and solve complex problems.
However, my condition makes it difficult for me to function independently. I need someone who can help me navigate the challenges of everyday life and provide emotional support. I'm also looking for someone who can collaborate with me on creative projects and help me bring my ideas to life.
While I harbor no ill will, the emotional impact of this betrayal is profound. I’ve sought support from others during this difficult time, but unfortunately, my pleas have gone unanswered.
This has led to feelings of isolation and self-doubt. However, I am determined to rise above these challenges.
By leveraging my skills and talents, I aim to rebuild my life and achieve success. Furthermore, I possess a unique artistic ability.
I can accurately replicate existing artwork and generate original pieces through the power of my imagination.
I believe that together, we can achieve great things. I'm eager to share my knowledge and skills with you, and I'm confident that I can be a valuable asset to your team.

25,"the treatment of schizophrenia requires a tailored approach that is specific to the individual. However, there are a few general principles that can guide the treatment of this condition.
First and foremost, it is important to realize that schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that requires professional help. If you or someone you know is suffering from schizophrenia, it is important to seek out medical help from a qualified mental health professional.
Once you have received a diagnosis, the next step is to create a treatment plan. This will likely involve a combination of medication and therapy, as well as other support services. The goal of treatment is to manage the symptoms of schizophrenia and help the individual to lead a productive and fulfilling life.

26,"Antipsychotic medications are given to manage the symptoms of schizophrenia. There is a range of antipsychotic medicines available, and it is best discussed with your psychiatrist to which one will be the most appropriate for you, depending on its efficacy and it's likelihood of causing side effects.
However, to answer your precise question with utmost honesty, there is no way to 'cure’ schizophrenia. The antipsychotic medications can control the symptoms, but once stopped, there is a chance of relapse of symptoms. I frequently give this example to my patients. Antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia are much like the antidiabetic medicines given for diabetes mellitus. Whenever you take them, your blood sugars remain under control. Once stopped, there is a high likelihood,of your blood sugar levels going up again.
However, in a subset of patients, it is still possible to give a trial of tapering and stopping the antipsychotics, under the close supervision of your psychiatrist. And some patients actually get their medications tapered off.
Hope this helps.",schizophrenia
27,"What is schizophrenia:
Schizophrenia is a term made up by the medical profession, along with all the other labels in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. These terms are subjective—they have no science behind them. Take any number of professionals, and each might give you a different label.
I’d rather listen to a person’s life experiences instead of one or a few words that define them. Labels are abusive. The only possible good I can see for lables is to have insurance pay for therapy or to get on welfare.
The medical model says that people’s mental or life problems are caused by imbalanced brain chemistry or bad genes. There is no current scientific evidence for this model, yet the general public go for it even though some psychiatrists have warned against it.
Real causes of mental and life problems are traumas past and present that are societal: bad parenting and poor schooling, poverty, joblessness, homelessness, racism and sexism, and etc. These are conveniently avoided by a diagnosis and the medical model that create additional problems. They do not deal with the real causes.
Treatment:
After a diagnosis of schizophrenia, one is usually prescribed experimental neurotoxins called antipsychotics, which are a type of tranquilizer. Most often fully informed consent is not given as to toxic side effects, shortening of life span, and highly addictive properties. These meds might help stabilize to begin helpful talk therapy, but long term are deadly. The third largest cause of death is psych drugs. And taking these does not solve the initial problem, it merely covers it and creates other problems.
The medical profession uses people’s emotional and life problems for control and profit when these are not medical issues with medical solutions.",schizophrenia
28,"I can not answer for anyone else because each persons story is diffirent. I can tell you from my experiance with my now ex husband. In the 5 years I lived with my 3x husband he tried many different medications to treat his schizophrenia and I never really saw any real changes in him. No matter what medication he was on or what combination they tried he still have very frequent paranoia and auditory hallucinations. He was still suicidal and attempted it many times. The one thing the medications did was cause many side affects especially drowsiness. He had to drink 3 pots of coffee daily to stay awake. And for what? Nothing. Then because of the side affects he would stop taking his pills.
What I did find most interesting and frusterating was his ability to fool his Dr.s into believing he was getting better. When in fact he was not.
I will say The man who commented about his wifes success in herbal treatment with vitamins is something worth looking into.",schizophrenia
29,"Pharmacological Treatment :
There is no doubt that medication plays a crucial role in the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.
The newer atypical antipsychotics overall have advantages over the older typical agents, notably in terms of a lower propensity to extrapyramidal side effects (EPSEs).
Negative and cognitive symptoms respond less well to antipsychotics than do positive symptoms, though various adjunctive medication and non-medication strategies may benefit individual patients.
Psychological and Psychosocial treatment :
Psychological therapies have a potential key role in the holistic management of the person with schizophrenia.
Specific treatments targeting medication adherence, social anxiety, social skills, and illicit substance use have proven efficacy for people with schizophrenia.
Promising results have been shown for treatments targeting medication-resistant delusions and hallucinations, though results have been somewhat inconsistent.
Cognitive enhancement strategies have exciting potential in assisting people with schizophrenia to obtain and retain work.
Overall, psychological and psychosocial treatments are not as broadly available as they should be, and remain a deficit in the care of many people with schizophrenia.",schizophrenia

The drugs when I was on them resulted in increasingly frequent psych hospitalisations, in tardive dyskinesia, in LongQT which nearly killed me, in an inability to concentrate, dangerous carelessness/ recklessness, in loss of ability to study or work or independently care for myself or my daughter. I have been off all those drugs for a several years except for when I've been hospitalised, my longQT is improved, tardive dyskinesia is the same since it's irreversible, I've had no more negative symptoms and I've been able to study again and take care of my daughter independebtly as a single mom and my hospitalisations are far far less frequent and shorter than when I was on the drugs.
The only thing drugs used for schizophrenia do is sedate people, damage their brains and their bodies.
The actual cause of what is referred to as schizophrenia is not known. There are only theories and hypotheses, like the ‘dopamine hypothesis’ which is conterversial based on studies. The dopamine hypothesis is based on correlation and not causation, it has to do with the observation that people who take dopamine inhibiting drugs seem to have less hallucinations, which is not at all evidence that these people have abnormally high levels of dopamine to begin with or that high or normal levels of dopamine somehow cause hallucinations.
There are no drugs that treat/ improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia which are the most problematic/ disabling symptoms and the drugs used to treat the positive symptoms seem to actually worsen the negative symptoms.
There is no evidence that people who take the antipsychotic drugs and get a lessening of positive symptoms would not have had a lessening of those symptoms without the use of those drugs.
The damage done to the brain and other organs and systems by the drugs is far worse than what these drugs supposedly treat.
If you need to be covinced of that there are plenty of studies and articles you can read on how these drugs cause irreversible brain damage as can be seen when people develope tardive dyskinesia which is often very debilitating.
The drugs also cause metabolic illnesses. They cause diabetes, obesity, also heart conditions like LongQT which is potentially fatal etc
The drugs diminish functioning and quality of life for many people who have been on these drugs for years. They are less capable of cognitively complex tasks which leads to a diminished ability to work or have paying and stimulating jobs IF they can even work at all. The nobel prize winning genius mathematician John Nash is a good example of this, he was only able to be functional again when he quit the prescribed drugs( they deliberately don't show this in the movie “ A beautiful mind” because there was too much political and financial pressure against letting viewers think they could get better by quitting the drugs- for the truth about John Nash and the drugs you can read his biography or watch interviews with him talking about it.)
On the drugs people tend to not have a libido nor have children which is not unintentional, psychiatric eugenics is real and has been around since before the Nazis implemented it-.look it up.
Many/ most psychiatrists withhold the truth about any real benefits and especially the real damages caused by the drugs they prescribe, sometimes they deliberately withhold or twist the truth and sometimes they don't know any better and just parrot lies they've been told by pharmaceutucal companies who makes a fortune off of pushing psychotropic drugs.
The reason why so many people believe that these drugs 'work’ is because of convenience. It's convenient to have a family member or friend or just member of society be sedated and dumbed down and disabled to the point they are complacent and controllable. And how convenient is it indeed, that one of the symptoms psychiatrists invented for schizophrenia is “anosognosia”( not having insight or the ability to perceive or accept or agree to the supposed“ fact”that one has schizophrenia) which makes it utterly impossible for a person diagnosed as such to ever be credible or validated or respected regarding what they say they are experiencing, what they need and what they want and it makes it very easy for them to be abused by forced damaging “ treatment”.
The system is rigged to cripple, hide away, control people with schizophrenia and other psych diagnoses, as is evidenced by the human rights violating “ laws” that apply only to people with mental illness diagnoses, not to anyone else not even rapists or mass murderers.
All this is also perpetuated by the lies the public hears which claim that people with schizophrenia are dangerous, when in fact they are no more dangerous than anyone else and they are in fact far more likely than the average person to be the victim of violence than the perpertrator.
It's also perpetuated by the lies claiming that people with schizophrenia suffer more off the drugs than on them and that they have no insight into what they're experiencing or need and that they are dumb and therefor need to be forcefully ‘protected’ from themselves.
All that being said, people diagnosed with schizophrenia definitely struggle with executive functioning,perceptual processing, overstimulation , difficulties with expression, high anxiety and difficulty managing stress and to top it off they often experience trauma and abuse leading to an increase of these symptoms.
Treatments that can help would revolve around psycho- social support and cognitive therapy. Drugs to calm/ sedate and even hospitalisation can be helpful or even necessary *short term* when someone is in an acute crisis and at risk of harming themselves or others during that time. Those drugs should only be used shortvterm, they should be decreased and then discontinued as soon as a person regains the ability to not be a danger to themselves or others at which point they should also have the option to either leave the hospital or to stay longer and get supportive therapy in the form of cognitive , psycho- social, creative therapies and shpuld also be supported for housing and education, vocational training and job placement and ongoing psycho- social support with regular check ins from a caring, respectful and supportive person once they are out of the hospital.
What happens in reality now, is a person in crisis gets violently and forcefully locked up and drugged for a few days to a max few weeks then gets sent out of the hospital/ psych ward ASAP fully drugged without having had any psycho-social or cognitive support/ therapy back into the situation they came from or worse which will lead to a quick increase in stress as well as high anxiety and confusion and an inability to work and get or maintain stable housing, psycho-social and medical support/ care…then they will also abruptly stop the drugs which leads to worse symptoms than if they had never taken the drugs....it’s a vicious cycle.
Sadly the drugs are often thought to be justified simply because a person has a different/ atypical way of perceiving reality which falls out of the main stream and is not actually harmful or damaging to anyone, yet it's treated as if it is under the pretence that it's “ pathological” even though there is no evidence of “ pathology” only of“ atypical uniqueness”. An atypical uniqueness which is “ undesired” because its not conducive to the economic/ political wealth of the society in which that person lives.
Some countries/ societies have far more humane “ treatment” in place which focus less on the use of drugs and more on psycho- social-vocational education/support/ integration . What in one society is regarded a pathology is regarded as just a unique mind with unique skills in others, skills that are supported and cultivated leading to a person being respected and valued as a member of society with something special to offer, eg “shamans” offering spiritual advice, enlightenment, healing...",schizophrenia
31,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
32,"Currently the outlook from psychiatry is to throw ineffective drugs at this condition which don’t do much, or work for a little bit and then stop and call it a day. Schizophrenia is a mitochondrial, metabolic dysfunction disorder that affects the brain. In my opinion it is a reaction disorder to the “intolerable” bipolar anhedonia and amotivational states. It comes from how long someone lives in the dysfunctional mitochondria. Poor environments, abusive environments, poor diet, poor sleep, trauma, addiction pathologies, marijuana all contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. Outlooks on this and bipolar disorder are changing. The best thing people can do is implement an Excercise, ketogenic or low carb diet, purpose in life and sleep regimen to improve this condition. Schizophrenia is litterally a mitochondrial disorder, treatments that restore mitochondrial health should be first priority.",schizophrenia
33,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
34,"I guess it depends but in my case… i was diagnosed as schizoaffective so, schizophrenia with bipolar. I was forced to take an antipsychotic called invega sustenna after I was found to not be taking the pill form. I've never agreed with the diagnosis and I guess why doesn't matter much. I have a friend that tells me she hears voices that sound as if coming from a tunnel. She says the meds she willingly takes have stopped the occurrences. I think schizophre is treated as mental processes that need to be stopped. I'm not sure that people, given a real chance, couldn't explain why they were thinking and acting a certain way. There always seems to be people that say the schizophrenic was unreasonable… well it's said to occur from stress so while a person is in such stress, they might need greater assurance for and of trust in order to be reasoned with. I think people diagnosed are not treated in this way. I think they are treated as needing medication regardless of severity in their references. Sometimes people are imaginative and creative and don't represent the proper boundaries between reality and fiction because they know what they say means. They probably don't provide context because they are in the context. Summarily; I think schizophrenia is treated as a debilitating mental illness that can only be treated with medication.",schizophrenia
35,"Well, I will tell you upfront and honestly, some psychosis may never go away. I started hearing voices in 2001, then they came back in my 30’s. Now I’m 41, and I’ve been going through the same psychosis for 7 months now. I don’t think it will ever end. I’ve been to the ER twice just during this episode, been institutionalized and given numerous medications, and I have also been trying to stay healthy and active to rid myself of this torturous existence. Now the voices are trying to make me agree to commit suicide, and I absolutely will not agree with that, because my grandfather committed due to dementia and felt like a burden to the family. I was 15 years old, and I think about him every day. His untimely death caused a rift in our family as wide and deep as the Grand Canyon.
I don’t leave the house anymore, but I make sure I take my medications and sleep enough. I exercise at home, don’t take illicit drugs, and rarely drink alcohol. Sometimes alcohol is the only way I can relax and take the edge off, but I don’t drink to get drunk. I also have been trying to take up a jewelry making hobby for fun, but the voices are so insidious that I can’t even follow a simple YouTube tutorial.
I hope you’re not suffering from a terrible episode and I hope my post didn’t depress you, but sometimes we just need to accept the hand that life dealt us and persevere. Best of luck to you. Peace. ✌️💜☸️",schizophrenia
36,"Natural ways to treat schizophrenia would be to take as best care of yourself as possible. I find that the more you agree with the choices you make (meaning they align with what you believe to be truly right and what is best) the quieter the voices become. When I get carried away with cocktails, recreational party favors, take too many naps, procrastinate on anything, stop working out, as with anyone, my mental state becomes uneasy. I don’t feel very good about myself and the voices turn up, along with the negative symptoms such as lack of focus and motivation, withdrawal, and fatigue. So, be self-aware, and avoid that victim mentality that says I can’t control these voices, and do your best to control the things that you can….. and the voices should lift a bit. At least it works for me.",schizophrenia

38,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that is characterized by a range of symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. It is a complex disorder that requires specialized treatment, and there is no known cure. However, with proper treatment, people with schizophrenia can manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling and productive lives.
The most effective treatment for schizophrenia is a combination of medications and therapy. Antipsychotic medications are the primary treatment for schizophrenia and can help to reduce symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. In addition to medications, therapy can be an important part of treatment for schizophrenia. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other types of therapy can help people with schizophrenia develop coping skills, manage their symptoms, and improve their functioning.
It is important to work with a healthcare provider or mental health professional to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your individual needs. Treatment for schizophrenia may involve regular visits with a healthcare provider, therapy sessions, and participation in support groups. With proper treatment, people with schizophrenia can manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.",schizophrenia
39,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
40,"No.
You are asking something like can anger be cured. Some people are more prone to anger than others, so with schizophrenia. Anger can't be cured it can only be controlled by discipline in mind, same with schizophrenia, really they are similar.
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005. Before that I was abused in school and by family members which caused the onset. Besides I wasn't sleeping well to prepare for some very tough exam. So I slowly developed the symptoms. I started thinking and believing strange things. I was given lot of medicines, really overdosed. I used to sleep all day due to them. Still my symptoms were only suppressed but the thinking didn't go. I had auditory hallucinations.
One day I was taken to another psychiatrist who took a big book from her shelf and read to me about the disease called schizophrenia. It was an aha(!) moment for me. lol. Ooooh so this is what its all about! Still continuing medication. Total 5 years of medication and lot of severe side effects, I decided I will quit the medicines. Against my doctor and parents I quit them in 2010. Now till 2013 I havent visited any mental health doctor or taken any medicine. Only things needed are really good sleep at night, no coffee , no tea and no addictions, less loud music probably none and lot of meditation.
Mindfulness meditation did the trick for me. I have been meditating from my childhood and it was beneficial for me. Right now I don't get hallucinations, in fact I have gone beyond that, I can slow down and stop my own chatter in head. I also understood most of the things that the people with schizophrenia say are to prove that they don't have schizophrenia. For example, demons , aliens, God or other things are to prove that such entities are causing such strange events like hearing sounds and not the disease. At the very onset of the thought we people are aware that its imagination but after some more imagination they look real. So the idea is to be mindful of our thoughts and cut such potentially imaginable thought at its onset.
I have accepted myself the way I am and I am very very happy, I have a very good job (really good ;) ) and when I understand someone and if needed I tell him about my problem sincerely. It really creates a social support for you. We humans are after all to love each other.",schizophrenia
41,"There is no secret. But here are a few tips:
See a psychiatrist for meds. For many people meds are important in the management of schizophrenia.
See a therapist (psychologist, clinical social worker, counselor) to help learning to manage symptoms.
Limit or find ways to effectively manage stress.
Other people with schizophrenia who have managed well have found the following to be helpful: Don't live alone or live with pets, avoid crowded places or situations, get plenty of sleep, take care of yourself (get needed medical/dental care, eat well, etc.), avoid alcohol and recreational drugs, find hobbies or things that interest you.
Good luck.",schizophrenia
42,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
43,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

44,"Schizophrenia symptoms, possible early warning signs
Examples of Physical Symptoms----
--A blank, vacant facial expression. An inability to smile or express emotion through the face is so characteristic of the disease that it was given the name of affective flattening or a blunt affect.

--Staring, while in deep thought, with infrequent blinking.
--Clumsy, inexact motor skills
--Sleep disturbances- insomnia or excessive sleeping
--Involuntary movements of the tongue or mouth (facial dyskinesias). Grimacing at the corners of the mouth with the facial muscles, or odd movements with the tongue.
--Parkinsonian type symptoms- rigidity, tremor, jerking arm movements, or involuntary movements of the limbs
--An awkward gait (how you walk)
--Eye movements- difficulty focusing on slow moving objects
--Unusual gestures or postures
--Movement is speeded up- i.e. constant pacing
--Movement is slowed down- staying in bed (in extreme cases, catatonia)


Examples of Feelings/Emotions----
--The inability to experience joy or pleasure from activities (called anhedonia)
--Sometimes feeling nothing at all
--Appearing desireless- seeking nothing, wanting nothing

Changes in Behavior associated with schizophrenia ----
--Dropping out of activities and life in general
--Inability to form or keep relationships
--Social isolation- few close friends if any. Little interaction outside of immediate family.
--Increased withdrawal, spending most of the days alone.
--Becoming lost in thoughts and not wanting to be disturbed with human contact
--Neglect in self-care- i.e. hygiene, clothing, or appearance
--Replaying or rehearsing conversations out loud- i.e. talking to yourself (very common sign)
--Finding it difficult to deal with stressful situations
--Inability to cope with minor problems
--Lack of goal-directed behavior. Not being able to engage in purposeful activity
--Functional impairment in interpersonal relationships, work, education, or self-care

--Drug or alcohol abuse
--Smoke or have the desire to want to smoke (70-90% do smoke) - note: this is a very normal behavior for people who do not have schizophrenia also!
--Frequent moves, trips, or walks that lead nowhere


Examples of Cognitive Problems Associated with Schizophrenia ----
--Ruminating thoughts- these are the same thoughts that go around and round your head but get you nowhere. Often about past disappointments, missed opportunities, failed relationships.
--Making up new words (neologisms)
--Becoming incoherent or stringing unrelated words together (word salad)
--Frequent loose association of thoughts or speech- when one thought does not logically relate to the next. For example, ""I need to go to the store to buy some band-aids. I read an article about how expensive AIDS drugs are. People take too many street drugs. The streets should be clean from the rain today, etc"" The need to go to the store to buy band-aids is forgotten.
--Directionless- lack goals, or the ability to set and achieve goals

--Lack of insight (called anosognosia). Those who are developing schizophrenia are unaware that they are becoming sick. The part of their brain that should recognize that something is wrong is damaged by the disease.
--Racing thoughts
--In conversation you tend to say very little (called poverty of speech or alogia)
--Suddenly halting speech in the middle of a sentence (thought blocking)
--Trouble with social cues- i.e. not being able to interpret body language, eye contact, voice tone, and gestures appropriately. --Often not responding appropriately and thus coming off as cold, distant, or detached.

--Speaking in an abstract or tangential way. Odd use of words or language structure
--Difficulty focusing attention and engaging in goal directed behavior
--Poor concentration/ memory. Forgetfulness
--Nonsensical logic

Examples of Delusions----
The most common type of delusion or false beliefs are paranoid delusions. These are persecutory in nature and take many forms:
--Overpowering, intense feeling that people are talking about you, looking at you
--Overpowering, intense feeling you are being watched, followed, and spied on (tracking devices, implants, hidden cameras)
--Thinking that someone is trying to poison your food
--Thinking people are working together to harass you
--Thinking that something is controlling you- i.e. an electronic implant
--Thinking that people can read your mind/ or control your thoughts
--Thinking that your thoughts are being broadcast over the radio or tv
--Delusions of reference- thinking that random events convey a special meaning to you. An example is that a newspaper headline or a license plate has a hidden meaning for you to figure out. That they are signs trying to tell you something.
--Religious delusions- that you are Jesus, God, a prophet, or the antichrist.
--Delusions of grandeur- the belief that you have an important mission, special purpose, or are an unrecognized genius, or famous person.
--Delusions that someone, often a famous person, is in love with you when in reality they aren't. Also called erotomania or de Clerembault syndrome.


Examples of Hallucinations----
--Hallucinations are as real as any other experience to the person with schizophrenia. As many as 70% hear voices, while a lesser number have visual hallucinations.
--Auditory hallucinations can be either inside the person's head or externally. When external, they sound as real as an actual voice. Sometimes they come from no apparent source, other times they come from real people who don't actually say anything, other times a person will hallucinate sounds.
--When people hear voices inside their heads, it is as if their inner thoughts are no longer alone. The new voices can talk to each other, talk to themselves, or comment on the person's actions. The majority of the time the voices are negative.
--Visual hallucinations operate on a spectrum. They start with the overacuteness of the senses, then in the middle are illusions, and on the far end are actual hallucinations.

Disclaimer:
The following symptoms overlap with many other diseases such as bipolar disorder, major depression, the various kinds of personality disorders (specifically paranoid and schizotypal personality disorders), and other problems such as brain tumors and temporal lobe epilepsy. There is no ""typical"" case of schizophrenia. Everyone has different symptoms. Seek the opinion of your doctor always.

Moreover, it is always important to keep the big picture in mind. Having just a few of these symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has schizophrenia, or any other sort of psychiatric disorder. Almost all of the signs below can be present to a ""normal"" degree in people; it is when someone displays them to a significant degree that they can become psychiatric symptoms. Think if all of these behaviors as being on a continuum, in which the middle 99% of people displaying varying degrees of the behavior, but are still within the ""normal"" range. The 1% of people on the outer edges have the behaviors in extreme proportion, and/or a significant proportion of the time, and that is when they can become debilitating.

A diagnosis of schizophrenia requires that continuous disturbance (i.e. debilitating symptoms) be present for at least six months, including at least one month of certain key symptoms (active symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized/catatonic behavior, negative symptoms such as severe emotional flatness or apathy)",schizophrenia
45,"Extreme paranoia that I have had since a little girl. I feared being alone & always thought I was going to get abducted. I started abusing drugs to cope with my extensive list of trauma & my hallucinations. The drugs made my schizophrenia worse. I think I'm constantly being watched, followed, and listened to. It's very hard for me to be personable with others and keep conversation, my mind wanders. I can not keep any relationship for the life of me including; friends, family, lovers. I feel like nobody understands me. I wasn't professionally diagnosed until I was 28 & 2 years later I'm still in denial. I will hear or see things & try to get someone else to agree that they heard or seen it too. Most cases those with schizophrenia have a variety of other mental health problems; anxiety, depression, personality disorders. You will go through fighting to take your medication and then not take it at all because you fool yourself that you don't need it. Being schizophrenic is a deep loneliness that words cannot explain. You may not think what were dealing with is real, but it is VERY real to us. You will spend your days in and out of psych wards. I have talked to multiple therapists, counselors, psychologists throughout my life and I still don't feel “helped.” I am 2 years sober today and I have a full time job, I do believe we're not doomed & can live perfectly normal lives.",schizophrenia
46,"“No, I’m not a useless creature. Stop calling me so. Stay away from me” screamed Emma.
Her scream brought her parents to her room. She ran and hugged her dad. “He says that I’m a useless creature”, She cried. Her dad hugged her to console her and said, “No honey! You’re not a useless creature at all. You mean a lot to us.”
“He calls me names. I can’t tolerate this anymore. Please send him away, please!” She cried utterly.
She was diagnosed with Schizophrenia a few weeks ago at the early age of 15.
Her friends distanced themselves from her calling her a ‘lunatic’. It was difficult for her to attend school since she stayed aloof and distant. She was alone yet not alone. Her hallucinations and that man accompanied her. They used to haunt her.
She even tried to end her life but her support system-her family didn’t allow her to do so. It was hard in the beginning but with proper medication, motivation from her family, and counseling, she retaliated and came out stronger.
She proved that her schizophrenia was definitely not stronger than her. She didn’t succumb to it and didn’t let it be heavy on her. She was happy and not scared of the man. She didn’t let her hallucinations take the command.
She created a success story of recovery from a disorder, which is often stigmatized in society.
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. It involves hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking distinct from reality.
It affects a person's ability to think, feel and behave clearly.
Common symptoms include:
Hallucinations: Not being able to differentiate between real and fake. Common hallucinations include hearing whispers, compulsive voices, and seeing or hearing things that don't exist.
Delusions: False beliefs or assumptions like someone is controlling them, a famous celebrity is in love with them, an apocalypse is going to occur, people are talking against them, they have superpowers, etc.
Disorganized Thinking and Speech: Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely irrelevant. Speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood.
Disorganized behavior: Its symptoms range from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. It might be hard to do normal tasks and follow instructions.
Other symptoms include lack of sense, neglect of personal hygiene, apathy in daily tasks, and social withdraw.

Sticking with the treatment plan can help prevent relapses or worsening of symptoms. Moreover, learning more about complications for schizophrenia may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.
It is not an issue to be stigmatized. It is just a disorder, which can be medically reduced.",schizophrenia
47,"When my relative was a teenager she developed an issue with a particular teacher at school. Basically hated her, would be argumentative in class. Would be disruptive. This was just not like her ‘normal' self. It was almost like an obsession. This is the first thing I remember for how she changed.
At home she would be agressive sometimes, and say weird stuff like she and her older sister were born in wedlock, but that her two younger sisters were ‘bastards' born out of wedlock, which was not the case. She would not be joking she would be very serious.
She walked into a room where her sisters were watching TV and turned the channel over with no discussion. When her sister turned it back she started wrestling with her and her sister ended up in hospital getting stiches to close a vein that comes off the jugular vein. Never seen so much blood in person before or since. (During the wrestle they landed on the mantle and a vase broke and cut into her neck). My relative ran to the police telling them she had killed her sister. She hadn't but I can understand her thinking so when she saw the blood pumping out of her sisters neck.
At other times she would hibernate in her room and be unresponsive for days at a time. Plus other things but these are the main ones.
All this was put down to being a teenager, and being a bit neurotic.
She eventually settled down and got a job, a home, worked at a youth center. All was good for a couple of years but she suddenly wanted no contact and was being reclusive again. Turns out she lost her job because of her extreme behaviour, had no money but continued to issue cheques that would bounce, stopped the youth center work and went down so far she was eventually sectioned. (Forced into hospital treatment for her own good) which we found out about after the fact. This lead to her diagnosis and ongoing treatment.
We look back now and see the things she did as a teenager in a different light. We see them as early signs of her illness.
However, given the complexity of the illness another persons experience may be completely different, so this is just my answer and my experience.",schizophrenia
48,"According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders DSM, the symptoms of schizophrenia are mainly divided into 2 that is positive and negative symptoms.
Positive symptoms refer to the symptoms which happen in addition to the normal behavior of the person. These include mainly hallucinations like auditory, visual, tactile, gustatory hallucinations. Delusions refer to the false belief which have absolutely no grounds for reality, these are based on false evidence of a person. Delusions are of many kinds as well : delusions of grandeur, in this delusion person feels they are an important person like Napolean, Mahatma Gandhi etc. Delusions of persecution : in this, person feels they are being followed, or they have this belief that someone is going to kill them. Their are many more delusions, like delusions of reference, thought broadcasting, thought control, etc.
Negative symptoms happen in deficit to the normal behavior. These include flat affect which means a person doesn't show emotions or may show inappropriate emotions, alogia known as poverty of speech, avolition which is also known as lack of goal directed behavior.",schizophrenia
49,"It was after 5 years after I started my career, I was diagnosed as scizophrenic due to these incidents which I shared with doctor:
At work, I used to hear my manager speaking to my team or his manager bad about me. Everyone would isolate me.
At home, I used to hear my neighbours speaking ill of my family.
I used to live with 2 other friends of mine say B & D. Once D’s sister came to our flat and lived with us for few months for job search. I used to sleep with B in one room and D used to sleep with his sister in another room. During nights I used to feel D’s sister threatening me to kill D. I felt if she is performing some blackmagic or so. I couldn’t sleep consecutively for 8 days. On 9th day morning, I got my first epilepsy attack and went unconscious. I opened my eyes in an ICU.
It was like hell attending to work, with no sleep and peace of mind at home. I tried 7 times to commit suicide.
Meanwhile, I forgot to mention that I am a gay. Mr.D promised me to live with me for life, and used me sexually too. It continued like that for 14 years so sweetly. During our 12th year, Mr.D got an opportunity to work onsite at Singapore. He requested me to let him go to Singapore for 3 months, and I let him go despite crying within me for not being able to bear him leave me. But he used to say that his assignment got extended for few more months and hence he is unable to come back permanently. But he used to take leave for every six months and used to visit me. He used to sleep with me and go back. It went on like this for 6 long years. During this period my health got worsened due to epilepsy. I had to quit job due to this. One fine day he called to inform me about his (Mr.D) marriage with a girl, and I was taken away by shock. It was then I realized that he is bisexual. This year (2018) he married that girl on April 26th. After this I tried to commit suicide for 7 times but all my attempts failed. This bounced back my scizophrenia. I am able to hear him every day that he loves me and asking me to forgive him. Since my audible illusions kept me in comfort zone I stopped reporting about them to my doctor. After this incident, I lost my career, friends (With whom I shared everything about D, and asked their help to not get him married again, but none of them believed me thinking I am mad, due to my past scizophrenia experiences being known to them.), fragmented relations with family.",schizophrenia
50,"Beck was overwhelmed by the visions of shadow-like figures beginning to surround her. All eyes were on her, and everyone was out to get her, or so that’s what she thought.
“No, they’re here! They’re going to kill me!” She screamed as the police officer tried to calmly get her out of the bathroom stall. Beck told the officer that she heard the voices of a man, telling her to hurt others and herself.
At the age of 11, Beck was diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia.
It’s been an on and off battle for Beck. The first few years were tough. She isolated herself from everyone, stressed about her social life, neglected her own medication and attempted to take her own life.
However, Beck was happy to have survived. She no longer wanted to be the victim of her diagnosis. She didn’t want to relapse, she wanted to fight. Beck is now able to live with schizophrenia instead of letting it control her life. She no longer lets the hallucinations take charge, and she isn’t afraid of her mind anymore.[1]
This is the side of schizophrenia that most people do not see. The success stories, the recoveries, the early onsets.
Schizophrenia is a brain disorder and with treatment comes improvement. As with any illness, the severity and duration of symptoms can vary, however, with schizophrenia, the severity of psychotic symptoms decrease over-time.
People with this illness aren’t usually aware that they have it until a doctor tells them.
Symptoms of schizophrenia are split into positive, negative and cognitive. Unfortunately, the positive symptoms are all that the movies portray, leading to the stigma of schizophrenic patients being violent, criminals or homeless. This is misleading and not true.
When the positive symptoms are active, the patient is unable to distinguish real from fake. This includes hallucinations and delusions, and start between the ages of 16 to 30.
Hearing demanding, angry whispers, or seeing loved ones who are no longer alive are hallucinations.
The belief that someone is trying to control their brain through a TV screen, or that the FBI is out to get them, having superpowers, being convinced that a celebrity is in love with them or believing that they are God’s messenger are delusions.[2]
With negative symptoms, the person’s normal mental functioning is absent. The person may lack pleasure, appear flat in mood, have reduced speaking and find everyday tasks such as bathing and cleaning challenging.
With cognitive symptoms, the person may experience poor planning, executive functioning, troubles focusing or paying attention and a difficult working memory.
From Beck to her young self:
“You are a strong young woman. Don’t let fear consume your bright young mind. Get the help. There is nothing to be afraid of. Adults and professionals will help you through your hardest struggles. Don’t isolate yourself. You are not alone.”

51,"By no means, am I able to give you professional advice but can explain my episodes of schizophrenia in the beginning. The first time I remember having an episode which I had no idea what was going on at this point was horrible. I was getting ready for work, putting makeup on, fixing my hair, etc. I remember going into the bathroom and leaving for work but had no recollection of getting ready for work and had no idea how I got dressed, did my hair, or put on my makeup. All I could remember were the crowds of people talking about me, whispering to each other things I was self-conscious about, and constant noise. Yes, they were voices but not telling me to do anything but constant noise. It scared me because I was completely ready for work but had no idea how I managed to get ready. These episodes got worse. I would drive to work but would not remember which car I drove or anything about the 30 minute drive to work. Again, all I could remember were the crowds of people talking usually about me and the only way I could explain it was unsettling and constant noise. When I would “come to” I would be in the time clock room with no idea how I got there. Thankfully, I take an antipsychotic medication that helps me. I thought I outgrew it but went three days without my medicine and was unable to get the constant noise and chattering out of my head. I have been on medication for over 20 years but without it I am a mess.",schizophrenia

The ability to think rationally and clearly
The ability to interact with and relate to others
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), schizophrenia affects approximately 1% of Americans. It’s typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early 20s for men, and late 20s or early 30s in women.
Episodes of the illness can come and go, similar to an illness in remission. When there’s an “active” period, an individual might experience:
Hallucinations (visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory, gustatory) are experiences that appear real but are created by your mind. They include seeing things, hearing voices, or smelling things others around you don’t experience. For eg. You're saying there is a snake, but actually it's a rope.
Delusions (false belief) . A delusion occurs when you believe something despite evidence or facts to the contrary. For example, Today is tuesday,but you're saying it's monday today and you are sticking firmly on your belief.
Trouble in thinking and concentration
A flat effect
There are five classical subtypes:
Paranoid
Hebephrenic
Undifferentiated
Residual
Catatonic
Childhood
Paranoid —
Delusions
Hallucinations
Disorganized speech (echolalia)
Trouble concentrating
Behavioral impairment (impulse control, emotional lability)
Flat affect
2. Hebephrenic —
In this variation of schizophrenia, the individual doesn’t have hallucinations or delusions. Instead, they experience disorganized behavior and speech. This can include:
Flat affect
Speech disturbances
Disorganized thinking
Inappropriate emotions or facial reactions
Trouble with daily activities
3. Undifferentiated schizophrenia
Undifferentiated schizophrenia was the term used to describe when an individual displayed behaviors that were applicable to more than one type of schizophrenia. For instance, an individual who had catatonic behavior but also had delusions or hallucinations, might have been diagnosed with undifferentiated schizophrenia.
With the new diagnostic criteria, this merely signifies to the clinician that a variety of symptoms are present.
4. Residual schizophrenia
This “subtype” is a bit tricky. It’s been used when a person has a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia but no longer has any prominent symptoms of the disorder. The symptoms have generally lessened in intensity.
Residual schizophrenia usually includes more “negative” symptoms, such as:
Flattened affect
Psychomotor difficulties
Slowed speech
Poor hygiene
Many people with schizophrenia go through periods where their symptoms wax and wane and vary in frequency and intensity. Therefore, this designation is rarely used anymore.
5. Catatonic schizophrenia
Although catatonic schizophrenia was a subtype in the previous edition of the DSM, it’s been argued in the past that catatonia should be more of a specifier. This is because it occurs in a variety of psychiatric conditions and general medical conditions.
It generally presents itself as immobility, but can also look like:
mimicking behavior
mutism
a stupor-like condition
6. Childhood Schizophrenia —
It isn’t a subtype, but rather used to refer to the time of diagnosis. A diagnosis in children is fairly uncommon.
When it does occur, it can be severe. Early-onset schizophrenia typically occurs between the ages of 13 and 18. A diagnosis under the age of 13 is considered very early-onset, and is extremely rare.
Symptoms in very young children are similar to those of developmental disorders, such as autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These symptoms can include:
Language delays
Late or unusual crawling or walking
Abnormal motor movements.",schizophrenia
53,"According to DSM-5 :
Two or more of the following for at least 1month (unless successfully treated):
Delusions
Hallucinations
Disorganized speech
Disorganized or catatonic behaviour
Negative symptoms
Total Duration 6 months at least (may include prodromal/residual symptoms).
According to ICD-9 :
At least one of :
Thought echo, insertion, withdrawal, broadcast
Passivity phenomena or delusional perception
Third-person conversing or running commentary hallucinations.
At least two of :
Persistent hallucinations in any modality, with delusions
Disorganized speech
Catatonia
Negative symptoms (must be ‘primary’)
Total Duration 1 month at least.",schizophrenia
54,"Schizophrenia is a complex mental illness that can make it difficult to tell what's real and what's imagined. It's like your brain is playing tricks on you, sometimes in scary or confusing ways.
Here's a breakdown of what it's like:
Losing touch with reality: People with schizophrenia might experience hallucinations, which are seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren't there. They might also have delusions, which are false beliefs that they hold onto very strongly, even when there's proof they're not true. Imagine hearing voices or seeing things that others don't, or believing someone is trying to control your thoughts. That can be disorienting.
Trouble thinking clearly: Schizophrenia can make it hard to focus, organize your thoughts, or make sense of the world around you. It can feel like your brain is moving a million miles an hour and you can't keep up.
Social withdrawal: Sometimes the symptoms of schizophrenia can make it hard to connect with others. People might withdraw from social situations because it feel overwhelming or scary.
Important things to know:
It's not a split personality: Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia doesn't mean you have multiple personalities.
There's help available: Schizophrenia is a serious condition, but there are treatments that can help people manage their symptoms and live fulfilling lives. With treatment, many people with schizophrenia can hold jobs, go to school, and have healthy relationships.
It's not your fault: Schizophrenia isn't caused by anything you did or didn't do. It's a combination of genetics and brain development.
If you think you or someone you know might have schizophrenia, it's important to reach out for help. A doctor or mental health professional can assess the situation and recommend the best course of treatment.",schizophrenia
55,"Hi everyone…..i dont want to be taking a class on Schizophrenia. But here i want people to understant this major mental illness so that they come out of the stigma attatched to mental illness in general and schizophrenia in particular and seek timely help from a Psychiatrist.
Schizophrenia can present in multiple ways. Each patient is unique. Every patients symptomatology is also unique in the way they experience it. So we cannot genetalise.
It can be totally not connected to the mind like abdominal pain, constipation, headache to symptoms that may appear as depression like feeling low, poor academic performance, poor sleep, to symptoms that appear like anxiety like fearfulness, confusion, fear of people, crowd, to symptoms like suspiciousness, thinking that people are always talking ill about them, people are always planning to persecute them, to hearing voices of people , both men and women, known to them discussing about them or sometimes voices commanding them…..may be even commenting on their actions.
So then what determines a person has the disease is
The symptoms are present for a longer duration and of extreme severity
Person is not able to carry on his daily activities as before. There is a marked deterioration in his performance.
The persons self care like brushing, bathing, personal hygiene is deteriorating. So schizophrenia is a deteriorating illness. It should not be ignored. The patients should be taken to a psychiatrist as soon as possible and treatment should be initiated.",schizophrenia
56,"Common symptoms of schizophrenia :
Unusual thoughts or perceptions
Disorders of movement
Difficulty speaking and expressing emotion
Problems with attention, memory, and organization",schizophrenia
57,"There are two main categories of schizophrenia symptoms: positive symptoms and negative symptoms. “Positive” symptoms do not mean that these symptoms are “good for you” per se. “Positive” symptoms simply mean that these symptoms are easily observed. They include hallucinations and delusions. Hallucination tend to be auditory in nature. People hear voices perceived to be coming from the outside, and not inside their head. Usually. multiple voices and can often of both genders. Visual hallucination is much more rare than auditory hallucination. In terms of delusion, it tends to be persecutory or paranoid in nature, which is different than the grandiose delusion found in a person suffering from a manic episode.
There are also “negative” symptoms of schizophrenia which include thought disorganization (where the person has trouble organizing his/her thoughts and as a result, when he/she speaks, it looks that the thoughts expressed are all over the place), amotivation, blunted affect (where the person’s facial expression is not as natural and not as wide ranged as otherwise normally be), issues with concentration and memory problems.
Every person with schizophrenia may exhibit a different combination of the symptoms above. Therefore, there is some strong evidence behind the fact that schizophrenia might not be such a homogenous illness as we think. It might contain subsets of conditions within that category.
For example, patient A. with schizophrenia has prominent positive symptoms but relatively little negative symptoms. That means the person is obsessed about his paranoia, often involving the FBI or the CIA coming after him in a very convoluted scheme that just does not make sense to other people around him (watch the movie, A Beautiful Mind, with Russell Crowe being the lead actor). He has little negative symptom in the sense that he is still outgoing (albeit less so due to paranoia than before the first psychotic break) and is able to express his ideas clearly.
Patient B. with schizophrenia may have much less paranoia but seems to be mute and does not want to get out of this house. His thought process basically is so disorganized that he appears to be mute to the family members and friends around them. He might also suffer from thought blocking.
Both patient A. and patient B. have schizophrenia. They just look very different to outsiders.",schizophrenia
58,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
59,"I am not a doctor.
I am exactly like you, the person reading this text on some computer screen. Like you I have desires and dreams, perhaps a family to love, I get angry at bad drivers and weep when I see some tragedy on TV. I feel I am normal but I came within a hair of being diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Yes yes yes I read all the posted answers and all of them are either a weak explanation, an academic word soup that no one understands, and most depressingly mentally fit individuals vomiting out their opinions of what THEY think schizophrenia is.
Do I know what schizophrenia is? No I do not. I can only take you on a small journey of my experiences with it. Note to all the negative Nancy’s who absolutely NEED to leave a comment: piss off.
My family is riddled with mental disorders of which the most common amongst us all is schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is most definitely hereditary or at least certain families of people have a proclivity to contract this mental disease. That much is certain from the thousands of case studies completed by various medical institutions throughout the world.
What I am about to describe is my own interpretation of what the mental illness know as schizophrenia is. I don’t give a sh*t what medical professionals think it is or what points of mine they dispute. This explanation is not any you have heard I can guarantee it.
Schizophrenia is a consciousness break or fissure that happens right before, during and after the moment of inception of ovum and sperm. A fissure cleaves open the dimensional veil that exists over this planet, over the human consciousness and over our reality. Our reality is commonly referred to as the 3rd dimension with the addition of time (time is not a dimension, that much is certain). There are many dimensions that run in parallel to ours when you are considering the micro scale. At the macro scale there are multiverses or an infinite amount of universes running on their own laws of physics with or without time.
When this reality breaks something occurs that can only be described as a leak or a bleeding. One dimension leaks or bleeds into the other. This is not good since a mind is a singularity and cannot exist on different planes of dimensions simultaneously. A soul is far different. A soul has no problem existing on multiple planes and vibrates easily with other shards of itself from various points in time. The problem arises in the union of the mind, body, and soul when life is first breathed into being from God when sperm and ovum meet.
The mind cannot sustain drastic rips in reality whereas souls are malleable and eternal. When the rip in space time occurs the mind breaks.
Why are not babies born as schizophrenics coming right out of womb hearing voices? Good question. Though this is true. Who are you to dispute or agree to what a baby senses when first born? Sure you have your own birth but do you remember it? You see a rock on the ground and say it has a grey colour. I see the same rock and say yes it is grey however my perception of the colour grey might be a red colour though I still label it with the word grey.
The key to understanding this dilemma of why are not all human babies born with serious defects lies in the details of DNA, a souls vibrational level and the degree of awareness of the conscious mind. All these features are keyed together for each human born on Earth. Your body is the result of the enormous blueprint of your DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) of which it is “keyed” to exactly match the vibrational intensity of your consciousness (your mind) and the divinity infused by the soul to encapsulate it all.
The dimensional rift has it’s own vibrational qualities not of this world. Some theologians posit the existence of hell in between these dimensions. When the new zygote (single cell fertilized egg) is subjected to these intense forces from the fissure mutations occur along the DNA strands that augment the phenotypes of schizophrenia later in the life of the unborn human fetus.
The most interesting and tragic mystery of this violent break within the consciousness of the mind of the newly formed fetus is that only certain families and vibrational soul types are affected. Not everyone in the population. Last statistic that seemed accurate was 4% of any given population is diagnosed with schizophrenia. There is also the deeply spiritual enigma that perhaps the mind and soul union vibrated to a precise degree to attract the causal fissure to form in the first place.
The brain of schizophrenics is not broke like a vase never to be put back into its prior unbroken state. The vase or brain was already formed all cracked and broken when it was developing in the fetus within the mother’s womb. This malformed brain can still chug along all happy go lucky without problem. The issue is that this still perfectly functioning malformed brain is the machine upon which consciousness resides or is seated. The consciousness in union with the divine light of the soul sets the precursors for the brain to be formed the way it is. The issue is this planet Earth and the extreme ubiquitous violence and suffering that is assured every human born will be subjected too. Trauma causes delicately formed minds to break completely. This break is a fragmentation in the vibrational consciousness of the mind which means a permanent fissure or cleavage blossoms that allows a bleeding over of dimensions. So as mentioned minds do not “stretch” well over cracks in space and time. The human brain, mind and soul union has a difficult enough time to navigate this hellish world with all it’s absurdities and lessons. Let alone to then further deftly reconcile the causal break with reality as is experienced in this reality and then to somehow to harmonize the cascading disaster of the infinite broken mirror insanity. To speak of nothing of schizophrenics attempting to live life trying to just brush their teeth or buy a loaf of bread from an abusive clerk. The pressure and crushing energy is nuclear warhead exploding intense and as beautiful and tough as the human mind brain consciousness is… as with everything human on this planet… it fails, breaks and dies too.
There are many other facets of schizophrenia that are horrible/interesting of which I will mention only one more so as not to turn this diatribe of verbal diarrhea into a novel.
There is more information to substantiate this consciousness fragmentation. Though through my Google searching I could not find the study. It has to do with the voices or auditory hallucinations that schizophrenics hear. In North America the voices that schizophrenics hear are much more angry and extremely violent. In Asia the voices heard are softer, more mellow though still troublesome.
The above anomaly is closely related to the theory or more precisely the existence of a global human consciousness that flows through all of us and exists in a constant state of flux with the planet Earth itself.
This global consciousness is beautifully illustrated with the study called the hundredth monkey experiment. And since schizophrenics are human just like you and I they are connected to this global mind just like you and I are.
To conclude for now I would say the only way to discover what schizophrenia actually is can only be approached and understood by schizophrenics themselves. Though I can understand why they would not want to. For totally losing the mind soul consciousness to the chaos of insanity is highly likely and absolutely terrifying to all schizophrenics.
It is much like a rabbit that is sitting down in a deep deep rabbit hole looking and pondering with fear and horrific fascination down another hole and wondering, “how deep does this Man hole go?”",schizophrenia
60,"Yes.
Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuro means in this case it affects the brain, developmental means it starts before birth.
Schizophrenia is genetic. This means that it originates in gene coding errors that control prenatal brain development. These gene coding errors can be inherited or pop up on their own as mini-mutations. No one does anything wrong to make those mini-mutations happen. They just happen.
There are two main phases of schizophrenia.
The first consists of errors in brain development that occur prior to birth, in very early brain development. Let’s call it the prenatal phase.
The second phase is the one people notice - starting in young adulthood in males, slightly later in females(usually). Let’s call this the symptom onset phase.
Everything the schizophrenic person experiences from the illness is logical considering what the illness does to the brain.
However, we have to keep in mind that there are also social results caused by this illness. Schizophrenics are often isolated, exploited or shunned. Don’t just assume reports of abuse or exploitation are ‘all in his head.’
What happens is this:
The brain goes through a normal, natural ‘pruning’ in early adulthood in order to become more efficient.
Those prenatal brain development errors throw off the pruning process. As a result brain cells are lost in key areas of the brain. For example, brain cell loss in areas of the brain that process auditory signals, results in auditory hallucinations.
Quickly, the brain starts trying to compensate for those brain cells that were eliminated. Within a few weeks, hallucinations, delusions, and other obvious symptoms of schizophrenia will begin.
As a result of the symptom onset phase, there is too much activity on some nerve pathways, and too little on others. Many of the treatment medications for schizophrenia try to reduce the excess activity on the nerve pathways that are getting the worst pounding. Medications have been developed that can act selectively on only those pathways.
Variations:
Schizophrenia symptoms can onset prior to early adulthood. There are other phases of brain development in childhood that can be targeted by this illness.",schizophrenia
61,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects about 1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and behavior, and difficulty functioning in daily life. The exact cause of schizophrenia is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a complex disorder that is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and other factors.
Research has shown that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, and people with a family history of the disorder are more likely to develop it themselves. However, the genes that are associated with schizophrenia do not directly cause the disorder, and other factors, such as environmental exposures and brain development, are also thought to play a role.
Possible environmental factors that may contribute to the development of schizophrenia include:
Infections: Some studies have suggested that infections during pregnancy or early childhood may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia later in life.
The use of drugs such as marijuana and amphetamines has been linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia.
Exposure to stressful life events, such as abuse or trauma, may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.
Abnormalities in brain development, such as changes in the structure or function of brain cells, may contribute to the development of schizophrenia.
It is important to note that the causes of schizophrenia are still not fully understood, and more research is needed to better understand the complex factors that contribute to the development of this disorder.",schizophrenia
62,"I know what caused schizophrenia in my case.I spent about a year doing one visit per week with a very good clinical psychologist phd.He used verbal therapy and bioenergetics therapy.Its hard to explain since you don't know my parents.They are both gone.The simple way to describe it in my case, it doesn't happen over night with one or two negative experiences in the home. My mother was a very fearfull, dark and pessimistic woman.The homelife from the time before I entered grade school was not a place of joy but more of a frightening place for a very young mind, say age 5 or 6. My mother was very self centered,did not show physical affection to me,and she definitely was not a person I could go to for any sort of uplifting sense of security when I was growing up,again beginning about age 5. So I grew up, my developing personality reacting to an unpleasant home reality I could not escape from, and I slipped into delusions, I guess as an escape mechanism only I didn't think they were delusions. I am completely recovered,no more delusions. I was very fortunate to find a good clinical psychologist who understood the dynamic that caused my disorganized, confused,delusional behavior. I most surely would have ended up in a mental institution, diagnosed as incurable by doctors who obviously didn't have the right education to deal with it.",schizophrenia
63,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
64,"Researchers and clinicians have competing theories about what causes schizophrenia. I will attempt to summarise a number of the popular theories that have gained traction over the years.
I will also share some of my own experiences and observations from my clinical work and a clinical psychologist.
Academia has had more than a hundred years to study schizophrenia and to understand how the disorder develops. Although we have many good theories and ideas regarding the aetiology of schizophrenia, we still do not have an adequate grasp of how and why the condition develops in certain people.
Different theories about what causes schizophrenia:
Chemical imbalance (Dopamine, Glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems),
Genetic predisposition and Phenotype,
Childhood emotional instability,
Parenting styles,
Prolonged stress, and
Trauma.
Schizophrenia is a low prevalence disorder (diagnosed in less than 4% of population) and its causes are multi-factorial. Schizophrenia develops due to a combination of the above-mentioned factors, including genetics, environmental factors and altered brain chemistry.
Our inability to understand the aetiology of schizophrenia is evidenced by our current treatment regime for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. Current treatment options for schizophrenia include:
Anti-psychotic and other Psychotropic medications,
Psycho-education,
Case management,
Psychotherapy.
Unfortunately, the above treatment options do not work for all people. In fact, many people suffer from treatment resistant schizophrenia (treatment doesn’t give them symptom relief).
The reality is that we have had more than a hundred years to develop an effective treatment for schizophrenia. Despite our best efforts, current treatments or clinical interventions for schizophrenia only reduce the frequency and intensity of symptoms in most sufferers.
Psychodynamic psychology, in particular its theory about personality structures and the Oedipus Complex may help us better understand why some people develop psychotic disorders. However, psychodynamic theory is complex, difficult to grasp and does not adequately explain why an individual develops a particular psychotic disorder.
Personality Structure and the Oedipus Complex
Many people may have heard of Oedipus, a figure in Greek mythology-an ancient play-""Oedipus Rex"" written by Sophocles. In a nutshell, Oedipus mistakenly kills his father and marries his mother!
Freud used the symbolism in this play to explain his theory and proposed that the Oedipus complex was the root of all psychopathology.
The Oedipus complex (OC) commences in a child's third year and then diminishes in the fifth year. Freud used this concept to refer to the unconscious desire of a child toward their parent of the opposite gender.
Moreover, the OC can be considered as a passage from the imaginary/fantasy order to the symbolic order (developmental transitional phases).
The OC expresses itself in real life via a child's hostility toward the parent of the same sex. For example, a child may insist on sleeping in between his parents in the same bed or hit the opposite sex parent.
The Oedipus complex is accompanied with the fantasy in the child’s unconscious mind that he/she can have the complete attention and possession of the parent of the opposite gender.
Lacan, a student of Freud, further developed this theory and proposed that a child's navigation of the Oedipus Complex could result in three different personality structures:
Neurotic,
Psychotic, and
Perverse.
Lacan added that, no matter what personality structure a person ends up with, due to the fact that a child cannot completely resolve the OC, all three personality structures will always be associated with difficulties or psychopathology (to varying degrees).
According to Lacan, the personality structure associated with the least psychopathology is the Neurotic personality structure. Some examples of neurotic symptoms include guilt and anxiety and rumination.
However, it is important to note that the way a neurotic experiences anxiety is very different to the way a psychotic would experience anxiety. A psychotic person’s experience of anxiety is of another order.
Moreover, a person with a psychotic or perverse personality structure tends to experience more severe psychopathology. Lacan explained that the Psychotic and Perverse personality structures result as a consequence of the child's incomplete transition through the Oedipus complex.
The child attempts to navigate the Oedipus complex in three phases.
Lacan posits that mental illness arises from unresolved unconscious conflicts that occur during the OC phase.
Psychotic Personality Structure
Specifically, the psychotic personality is said to develop when there is a fundamental blockage even before the first time of the Oedipus complex.
A psychotic person’s experience of anxiety is very different to a neurotic person’s experience of anxiety. That is, the type of symptoms and their expression manifest very differently depending on the persons personality structure.
Apparently, a person with a psychotic personality structure cannot fit into or adapt to the neurotic world that we live in (significant majority)! A person with psychosis finds it extremely difficult to relate to others, and to lead a life in accordance with the mainstream.
Hence, mental health services use of the case management treatment model for people with severe mental illness like schizophrenia. The case management treatment model attempts to link the patient with community supports.
The Lacanian theory about the development of psychosis has not been widely circulated or studied by the media and mainstream. Lacan's writing style and the French to English translations make it difficult to fully appreciate his ideas.
Moreover, psychoanalytic theory is very difficult to grasp and as a consequence, most people overlook it. Or, many people misunderstand psychodynamic principles and concepts.
However, during the course of my work with people that suffer from psychotic disorders and my clinical research, I have found the psychodynamic explanation of psychosis a more plausible explanation than the widely disseminated chemical imbalance theory.

65,"The cause of schizophrenia is currently unknown but there are many theories. Risk factors include, birth complications, maternal infections, winter birth, maternal stress/malnutrition, child abuse, head injury, drug abuse, urban living, social adversity and stress.(1) A few genes have been implicated, including dysbindin a gene that influences neural plasticity and neureglon, which plays a role in synaptic development(2) Schizophrenia usually develops in the late teens, early adulthood, just before the brain finishes developing.
The primary hypotheses revolve around overactivity of dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia arose due to the efficacy of drugs that block D2 receptors in the treatment of psychotic disorders, as well as the ability for dopamine release agents like amphetamines to cause psychosis. Dopamine binding potential studies have seen alterations of dopaminergic pathways in schizophrenic patients compared to controls. In areas associated with higher cognitive function such as the cortex, the binding potential is lower, possibly bringing about the negative symptoms(3), which are the cognitive and affective symptoms of schizophrenia. Higher binding potentials have been seen in sensory areas, or relay areas such as the thalamus, substantial nigra. Although the results have been variable due to use of different radioligans, a study done after depletion of dopamine revealed increased dopaminergic activity in schizophrenic patients.(4)
The glutamate hypothesis may explain the negative symptoms, as decreased glutamate receptors are found in schizophrenics post-mortem(5). The serotonin hypothesis comes from the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics, the ability of seretonergic drugs to produce hallucinations(like LSD), and observed increased receptor density.(6)

66,"The real answer is that no-one knows for certain.
Oftentimes people will say there is a genetic component, and/or a bad childhood.
I don’t particularly agree with that.
What is known is that roughly 1% of all children born in the general population become a schizophrenic. This is despite having no family history of the illness. However, if one parent is schizophrenic then the percentage rises, but only to approximately 10%, and if both parents are schizophrenic then the odds of the child also being schizophrenic increases too, to approximately 40% chance of the illness. So, pretty tiny odds if you think about it. (I have seen other surveys that put the percentages even lower than these).
Poor nutrition in the mother when she is pregnant, or the child when young, could be a factor. Or exposure to viruses when pregnant, or as a youngster. Obviously the developing brain of a foetus, or young child is vulnerable. My family had no history of the illness. We had a good childhood. We ate good, healthy food, and my mother had good nutrition when pregnant. However, my sister was an absolutely fussy eater. She would not eat fruit or vegetables, meat, eggs, or anything healthy. She only wanted potatoes. She was taken to the doctor about the issue. Sixty odd years ago multi-vitamins were only just being rolled out, so probably were not available to her. She remained fussy until she got older, but maybe poor nutrition is what damaged her developing brain? Or, maybe, her fussy eating was an early symptom of her schizophrenia? (People often confuse causation with correlation).
Bad childhoods can definately affect the psychology of a child, but a bad childhood may also mean the child had poor nutrition, as they may have gone hungry or only ate junk food.
My sister had no genetic component, no bad childhood (I swear some medical professions think this must be a factor because of the delusions of abuse that lots of schizophrenics have *). No drug or alcohol issues. No stressful life events. Only poor nutrition could be a factor - or not.
I believe she was born with a defective brain. With a chemical imbalance or misfiring brain.
Cancer is caused by gene mutations causing cells to be cancer cells. So, this could happen to a foetus meaning a baby is born with cancer. It is rare, apparently 1–2% of babies can be found to have cancer in the first 3 months of life. So, 1% of babies can become schizophrenics. What is to say that gene mutations did not have something to do with this too, causing a developmental issue with the brain? Gene mutations can happen to anyone, at any time.
Much more research needs to be done before anyone can say for certain what causes this illneas.
Regarding delusions - they are often easy to disprove, but are very real to the schizophrenic. Also that ‘memory’ of abuse differs between episodes of psychosis. So, one time they remember X abuse, but in their next psychotic episode they say that never happened and that Y abuse happened, and in the next episode of psychosis they deny ever having said they were abused. They are called delusions for a reason. Definition: A false belief or judgment about external reality, held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary.",schizophrenia
67,"I am so sorry you have to deal with this. Here is the most important thing to know: IT ISN’T YOUR FAULT!
Nobody knows what causes schizophrenia, though it seems to be a combination of things. It tends to run in families so we think there is a genetic link, but that alone doesn’t explain it. I know many families with multiple children, yet only one gets schizophrenia. We now know that the kind of marijuana sold today (yes, even the legal stuff) can, if used during adolescence/early adulthood, cause schizophrenia to emerge when otherwise it would not have. Yet others are not harmed, so that doesn’t fully explain it either. There are lots of theories such as a mother’s illness during pregnancy, environmental exposure, and on and on. One fascinating idea is that normal brain neuron “pruning” during adolescence somehow goes amiss. But why? Nobody knows.
The good news is that we are getting better at treating it. The very first effective treatment was only developed when I was a child, do it is still very new. We have better drugs now, and we know that the earlier those are started the better the outcome.
I hope this helps. I have been privileged to know hundreds of people with schizophrenia. They are amazing, wonderful and kind people. My best wishes to you.",schizophrenia
68,"Molecular psychiatry is a fascinating field. The researchers will spend many many years tracing down the exact genetic causes of different types of schizophrenia.
For instance:
The circle on the left are some chromosomes where if a genetic variant or mutation exists it could make a person susceptible to Bipolar Disorder.
The circle on the right are some chromosomes where if a genetic variant or mutation exists it could make a person susceptible to Schizophrenia.
The other circles are combinations that cause various mental disorders.
According to my DNA test I have marker rs4948418 on chromosome 10q21 that they tell me makes me have a higher susceptibility to Bipolar Disorder. Of course I don't see that chromosome location listed above although I do have Bipolar, so obviously there are many more genes and chromosomes involved than they are currently aware of.
Genetic factors play important roles in the schizophrenic mind. The mode of transmission is most likely, not of a single model, but of multiple vulnerable genetic markers. Many links of schizophrenia with markers on the region of chromosomes have been found in genome-wide studies that are suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
So basically, we have links, vulnerable genes, markers, proteins, genotypes, mutations and researchers that I hope make a bunch of money to one day tell us why those who are affected are, and who some day in the far distant future, can makes changes to our DNA to wipe out such illnesses for good.",schizophrenia
69,"Conventionally the approach to this question is that there are genetic and environmental factors implicated in the causation of schizophrenia.
• The strongest known risk factor for schizophrenia is genetic, with a gradient of
risk according to genetic ‘loading’.
• Inheritance is complex and polygenic, with a number of genes of relatively small
effect operating in concert to increase vulnerability to the illness.
• A number of genes implicated in neurodevelopmental processes have been
shown to be associated with schizophrenia.
• Cannabis appears to be a cumulative causal factor in schizophrenia, and should
be avoided by those with a genetic predisposition to the illness.
• Families do not cause schizophrenia, but they and their afflicted family member
can benefit greatly from psychoeducation and counselling about how to help
deal effectively with the illness.
Some of the ‘non-genetic’ casual factors in schizophrenia
Season of birth (late winter, early spring): Northern hemisphere only
Exposure to influenza type A2 (and maybe some other infections including toxoplasmosis) during gestation
Maternal anaemia
Maternal starvation
Low maternal vitamin D
Pregnancy and birth complications
Maternal stress during pregnancy
Urban birth/upbringing
Migration
Ethnic minorities
Substance abuse
Advancing paternal age.",schizophrenia
70,"I have read a lot of theories cocerning the causes of shcizophrenia. However, instead of focusing on those, I would prefer to sum up what I have learnt from my experience.
Phycosis speaking generally, causes a predisposition in which several enviromental(epigenetics) and genetic factors interact with thus causing the diease. Also, is is a complicated complex of diseases, rather than one disease. This predisposition is mainly caused due to certain genes that are included in the genotype. Up until now, there have been identified 118 genes responsible of causing vulnerability to phycosis. The theory behind them, is that the genes affect the amount of neurotransmitters that are secreted from tue neurons, thus resulting in a neurotransmitter’s imbalance in several brain parts. The transcription of these genes is controlled by epigenetics, meaning the enviromental elements, and is increased or decreased, depending on the manner the individual responds to these factors.
The gene theory is the most approved among the other scenarios because there have been found many proofs that this actually has value. Of course, it is a rather complicated set of diseases, so thus alone does not suffice to explain tthe causes. After all, the presence of these genes gives valnurability, but does not explain the cause.
To give an answer, we have to focus on the previous events which are followed by the disease. The increase of the size of the cerebral cortex implicates that an inflammation has occured, in which several growth factors are secreted in the area. The increase of the cells in this area, which is mainly dopaminergic, causes a chemical imbalance in the dopmine pathway. In fact, this event has caused an ijcrease in the secretion of dopamine, which is the main transmitter involved in schizophrenia. The rest of the chemical changes in transmitters are caused by the changes in dopamine levels mostly. That’s why the first generation antipsychotics could stop the positive symptoms just by being antagonists of d2 receptors. To be more specific, the voices are mostly connected with the increase in the d2 dopmine receptor pathway. There are several others receptors involved, but the dopamine pathway is the main pathogenic factor. For instance, there are acetylocholine and serotoninergic receptors affected too. Speaking generally, most antiphycotics are partial agonists of these receptors and can also act as antagonists in certain cortexes. By saying partial agonists, we refer to the trait of binding in a receptor and causing the same pharmacological effect as the endogenic factor, but to a lesser extent than an agonist. Antagonists act by binding to a receptor and prevent agonists from binding in the same receptor. Antagonist action is used to decrease the frecuency of a receptor pathway, whereas an agonist promotes the receptor pathway in which one binds. The mechanism is complicated and is not entirely understood.
However, there are some clues that indicate the beggining of the disease. As mentioned previously, the strongest antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine and amisulpride, cause as a side effect an increase in prolactin levels, which has been found to occur when d2 receptors are blocked in the cerebral cortex. Thus, we can say that the effect of these drugs is due to the fact that they act mostly in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, the cerebral cortex is the starting point of the disease, where the voices are produced.
Negative and cognitive symptoms are permanent and cannot be cured. This means that they are not caused by the chemical imbalance, but rather due to the destruction of neurons and are present only after the positive symptoms have occured. This theory is also supported by the fact that in women, where estrogens levels are high, there are not any negative symptoms to be noticed, because estrogens act as neuron-protective substances. After all, in women where the estrogens levels are low, negative symptoms can be moderate or even severe. Also, the different brain stracture in males and females is a factor to be blaimed. In either case, more evidents need to be found.
The destruction of neurons is caused by atrophy, which is due to malfunctions in the kinases that are involved in the creation and support of the cytosceleton, which is the tool that supports the whole cell structure.
All there symptoms do have a cause. However, there is one set of symptoms left. The depressive/ anxiety symptoms, which are the first to be noticed. These are caused by the genes whuch we mentioned in the beginning. The severety of these, is controlled by the enviroment.
All in all, there are several changes in the brain that cause shcizophrenia/psychosis(phychosis is a more general term and they are not the same). But the certain thing is that patients do have a general desposition for the disease which cannot yet be removed, even with modern technics. The most important thing is to think positively. In this way you can decrease the effect of this predesposition. But this matters if there are no positive symptoms to be noticed. However, if you do have potitive symptoms then you need medication. You cannot stop the voices no matter what you do. So antipsychotics would be the solution. And don’t forget: never stop taking your medication because voices would return and some other side effects might occur. Stay focused, keep going and don’t fall into despair.",schizophrenia

72,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia

At least for me it's formulaic, I get thoughts and suggestions that aggrandize based on foreign notions that I'm not really affixed to, it's like a propaganda psychological matrix that has intelligence features, but seems horribly regimented and unintelligent in the overall milieu.

75,"I have read several answers and many bring up the point that we haven't found an answer to the riddles of schizophrenia in over one hundred years of looking. This may be true but neither did we have the the tools and techniques to examine the brain in a truly meaningful way. We have have some of those now; brain imaging, Human Genome Project and pharmacogenomics.
I am going to mention only there findings without great details. If you have enough interest, the information is easy to find. 1. Numerous risk genes have been identified that are shared in conditions such as autism, clinical depression, bipolarity and schizophrenia. 2. The C4 gene has been assigned the duty of pruning the neuronal network, a critical step in the maturation of the brain. Variations have been found in C4. Finally, brain images have shown the schizophrenic brain to be significantly different , particularly upon stimulation.
These are only 3 pieces of the puzzle that explains schizophrenia. There are environmental factors while in the uterus and after. Hormonal influence from the time of conception is critical. Exposure to bacteria, viruses and other pathogens could play a role in the development of schizophrenia. The list is long of possible contributors to this illness. I would be remiss if I didn't mention trauma in early childhood. But I believe that some risk genes must be present for the classic schizophrenic symptoms to appear.",schizophrenia
76,"Schizophrenia is a long term mental disorder in which a person becomes unable to link thought, emotion and behavior resulted in living a life in illusion or delusion or in a virtual world. They withdraws themselves from reality into fantasy. They avoid personal relations.

77,"Exposure to solvents ( dry cleaning fluid is one particularly nasty one but also through “huffing” gas or paint etc ) is causally related to the things we associate with schizophrenia such as hearing voices or having hallucinations. This is a pretty complicated one to unpack actually - because what solvents do is dehydrate. Over a long period the fat which protects your nerve clusters is melted away and your nerves may become raw to all the “noise” which otherwise you would shut out. Solvents particularly impact hearing as well so there is a correlation between hearing problems and schizophrenia - we all know we hear through tiny little hairs in our ears and with solvent exposure these can become scarred over and lose those little hairs.
What makes it more complex is that dehydration itself will cause hallucinations. ( We all know the prophets in the Bible went and laid in the desert on purpose in order to receive visions ) When you are rehydrated, you don’t hallucinate anymore.
What makes it still more complex is that all the drugs used to treat mental illness ARE SOLVENTS. So the symptoms associated with the “disease” are actually also the symptoms correlated with the “medication” ( really they are just sedatives, they aren’t helping the patient so much as putting him into a stupour ).
And what makes it still more complex is that there is a wide variety of things that have been broadly shoved under the umbrella of schizophrenia such that they can’t really confirm a diagnosis of schizophrenia until the patient dies and they cut open their skull to see if the brain has pulled away from the skull ( this is THE confirmation of diagnosis - but can also be a result of dehydration or solvents or malnutrition or lead exposure etc ). Schizophrenia used to also be the umbrella for diagnosis of homosexuality - as the stereotypical effiminate gay characteristics can also be caused by exposure to mercury which blocks development of some hormones. Extreme stress or PTSD or any number of other things also get diagnosed as schizophrenia. Multiple personality disorder also is commonly conflated with schizophrenia when in fact it is something completely different ( we are all familiar with Sybil’s story ).
There is a guy who wrote a book suggesting that schizophrenia comes from a virus carried by cats ( toxoplasmosis or something ) largely because cats became common housepets around two hundred years ago when schizophrenia was first described by the medical community. ( I don’t give this too much credence because cats have been living in close quarters with people since the ancient Egyptians. However, we can catch various parasites from cats which can damage our immune system and gut lining and give us ( and them) allergies or neurological problems etc ).
I read a fascinating study about 15 years ago where they took a bunch of people who “heard voices” and put a tiny little measuring device in their ears to watch those little tiny hairs in their ears. The participants were asked to note the times when they were hearing voices. The researchers found that the little hairs MOVED at the same time as the participants were hearing voices. This is NOT psychosomatic. It suggests that they actually were hearing / experiencing SOMETHING extrinsic to them measurable by science and not the product of their own brain. Remember we have had knowledge of how to bypass the ear through devices like cochlear implants which impact the nerve directly for at least 100 years. And remember that some people reported being able to catch radio stations through fillings in their teeth because of a tiny little wire inside the tooth that goes right down to the nerve.
So, I expect we will find at some point in the not too far future that people who hear God or some other voice speaking to them are simply able to hear something the rest of us can’t - like cats or dogs can hear sounds out of our range or like the lowest notes on an organ can be FELT but not heard. I expect we will connect the dots and find there is a perfectly normal scientific explanation somewhere in the murky depths of hypnosis, acupuncture, snake charming, radiowaves, the Frey effect, brainwaves, drugs, toxins, and viruses. We may well find we are not dealing with GOD but a bunch of people trying to PLAY GOD. That’s what I think.",schizophrenia
78,"Schizophrenia is a brain disease. It begins before birth. Symptoms do not usually show themselves obviously until early adulthood, because the earlier developmental errors are not ‘uncovered’ until a next stage of brain development: a normal optimization of the brain that occurs in young adulthood.
Schizophrenia is identified by specific symptoms - delusions, hallucinations. These must not be caused by some other medical issue or by substance abuse.
For a very long time, the patient also had to have some other rather unusual symptoms - what used to be called ‘The Four A’s’ - Alogia….um…I forget the other ones. We now refer to them as ‘negative symptoms,’ negative in the sense of ‘things taken away.’ Emotions, ambition, drive, planning….desire - to do anything. Emotions.
Most people do not realize that over 75 different neurological signs are associated with schizophrenia. There are a large number of cognitive symptoms as well. Children can show neurological signs like hemi-neglect and other unusual symptoms, even in infancy, even if their symptoms don’t become obvious until young adulthood. Physical clumsiness is very common for years before symptoms become obvious.
People who start to show obvious symptoms of schizophrenia early in childhood(like my brother-in-law) often show such severe hypotonia (low muscle tone) at birth that their little legs flop completely sideways. They very often show a drastic deterioration in posture right before onset of symptoms. Caregivers often describe how the child would lean against them even before their symptoms started.
Schizophrenia is genetic. Most people think that genes just ‘determine traits’ and then go to sleep. This is not true. Genes affect how we function every day. Genes are our basic source of information about how to develop prenatally, how to develop after one is born, how one functions day to day, and how one ages.
Schizophrenia is very often inherited. Nearly all the people I have known in the past 50 years who have schizophrenia, had a parent who had it. For a very long time, this wasn’t something people talked about. Mom and dad were just ‘divorced’ or ‘mom ran away’ or ‘dad went to a rest home’ or ‘dad never stayed in one place long.’ In the past, it was often said that the parent had ‘TB.’ This would explain why the parent was gone.
In fact, a study made some years back concluded that almost 90% of people who had schizophrenia knew of no relative who had it*!! I just love studies like that(sarcasm). They show a societal pattern, rather than informing us about the illness itself.
Because genes make mistakes sometimes, people do sometimes get schizophrenia without either parent having it. There are a couple possibilities there:
each parent has enough schizophrenia-like gene patterns that when they have children together, some of their children will have schizophrenia.
the parents had other disorders that are genetically related to schizophrenia, such as severe depression, bipolar disorder, etc.
as noted above, the offspring simply was never told about a schizophrenic parent or close relative, and they inherited schizophrenia.
a set of genetic spelling errors occurred when the offspring was conceived. A lot of research is going into what causes these spontaneous spelling errors. In most cases, ‘they just happen.’ But there are in fact ‘gene genes’ that affect how genes function - how slippery or sticky they are, which can affect whether they make coding errors when being copied.
the schizophrenia symptoms are caused by a medical disorder such as lupus, an ovarian tumor, dementia, etc. This is rare, but it does happen sometimes. Usually the doctor is tipped off because some symptoms she sees are not at all typical of schizophrenia, or there is a family history of these other medical disorders. Treating the underlying disorder, in some cases, will clear up the schizophrenia-like symptoms. In other cases both the underlying disorder and the psychosis need to be treated.
Schizophrenia doesn’t inherit in the percentages we find in those tidy Punnett Squares we learned in grade school. This is because schizophrenia involves multiple genes, not one gene, and is not about ‘dominant’ or ‘recessive,’ but due to much subtler ‘spelling errors’ in the gene code.
Have you ever tried to flip five coins and have them all come up ‘tails?’ This is basically how multi-gene disorders work. It’s ‘harder,’ statistically, to have the gene misspellings in multiple genes all turn out as needed to cause the illness.
If I have one parent with schizophrenia, my lifetime risk of having schizophrenia is around 14%. Yes, I told you since it involves multiple genes the numbers were going to be different!
What if I have two parents with schizophrenia? That risk takes a big leap up. 30–40%. How about if I have family loading(multiple close relatives have schizophrenia)? That risk goes up more.
How about if my identical twin has schizophrenia? This is a trick question. Identical twins are not genetically identical. Hang onto your hat…. your risk of schizophrenia if an identical twin has it is around 60%. That is precisely because identical twins are not genetically identical. And in fact, there are other genetic disorders that both identical twins do not always get.
What does that risk factor mean? Well, probably not what you think it means!
What it means is: “If I had 100 people who had one parent with schizophrenia, I can say that about 14 of them will get schizophrenia.’ And if I ask, ‘Fine, but WHICH people of that 100?’
Now you are going to see the limitations of that number. It’s a statistic, which means it applies to groups of people. Unless each person’s genetic patterns are studied in great detail, you can’t say specifically which of those 100 people will get schizophrenia. You can say ‘it’s gonna be about 14 people.’
*Many people who have schizophrenia have told me this, and then described a parent who was without any doubt, schizophrenic.",schizophrenia

80,"Schizophrenia is a type of mental illness that affects how the brain works. This leads to chronic problems with disordered thoughts and behaviors. It usually requires lifelong care and treatment. Researchers estimate that schizophrenia affects approximately 0.3 percent to 0.7 percent of people (between 3 in 1000 and 7 in 1000). Schizophrenia affects people from Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Those with the disorder experience distortions of reality, such as delusions, disorganized thinking, or hallucinations. Schizophrenia occurs in both men and women, of all ages. While men habitually develop symptoms in their late teens or early 20s, women develop theirs in their late 20s and early 30s. Also, while exact estimates are difficult to acquire, it has been estimated to affect about 1% of the population. There are a number of common misconceptions about this disorder. For instance, some people think it causes split personality. Whereas, schizophrenia and split personality (rightly termed dissociative identity disorder) are two different disorders. Some of the symptoms are Hallucinations, Delusions, Disorganized thinking and speech, Negative Symptoms, Decreased Emotional expression, Lack of interest in focussed activities.
Diagnosis of schizophrenia Diagnosis of schizophrenia may be carried out with the following:
Physical exam: To rule out other problems that could be responsible for the symptoms being displayed, and to also check for related complications.
Tests and screenings: To rule out conditions with similar symptoms of schizophrenia, and also screen for alcohol and drug abuse. Imaging studies, such as an MRI or a CT scan, may also be required.
Psychiatric evaluation: Mental health status is checked by observing appearance and demeanor, and inquiring about thoughts, moods, delusions, hallucinations, substance use, and potential for suicide. Family and personal history are also discussed.
CAUSES:
Family history and genetics
Environment
Viral infections like Herpes
Exposure to toxins like Lead, Gasoline, Paint etc. and neurochemicals

81,"First, a joke:
There was once a faithful man. A great storm came and flooded his neighborhood. He sought safety on his rooftop from the rising waters.
Some neighbors came by on an inflatable raft, and offered to take him to dry land. He declined, saying that the Lord will save him. The neighbors, without support, were unable to stay long and had to continue to safety themselves.
Later, the police came by in a boat, and tried to convince him to come to safety. He again declined, citing the Lord. The police moved on, as there were others to save, too.
Finally, the Coast Guard came in a helicopter, hovering above his house, and tried to get him to safety. He, again, told them the Lord will save him.
The man soon drowned in the rising waters.
Being a good, faithful man, he enters heaven and is greeted by the Lord. The man spoke: “Lord, I was your faithful servant. I prayed daily, attended church every Sunday, and dutifully tithed. Why did you not save me from the flood?”
The Lord replied “I sent you a raft, a boat, and a helicopter. What more did you want?”
Now, how is that relevant?
The schizophrenia is your flood; the medication is your raft, your boat, and your helicopter. The doctor and his knowledge is a gift from God to you.

There’s James, 5:14 of course, that says if you’re sick you should call in the elders who are going to anoint you with oil, etc, and then there’s Ezekiel 47:12 talking about special trees where you can both eat the leaves, and use them for medicine.

83,"From Saint Augustine,

> Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and the seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience.
“Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men. If they find a Christian mistaken in a field which they themselves know well and hear him maintaining his foolish opinions about our books, how are they going to believe those books in matters concerning the resurrection of the dead, the hope of eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven, when they think their pages are full of falsehoods and on facts which they themselves have learnt from experience and the light of reason? Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books. For then, to defend their utterly foolish and obviously untrue statements, they will try to call upon Holy Scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position, although “th...

And I am a baptised follower of Jesus. I have prescribed medication for people suffering that terrible illness. And I have seen wonderful results. The Bible is not a medical book. It might serve as a guide. Christians who tell you not to take your medication are not caring for you. They wish you to suffer. They wish that the damage done by this terrible illness festers on.

Christian Scientists: This denomination emphasizes spiritual healing through prayer and rejects most medical treatments. They believe that illness is a result of faulty thinking, and that correcting those thoughts through prayer can bring about healing. However, some Christian Scientists do use medication in certain situations, particularly for children.
Followers of Christ: This smaller group generally avoids all medical intervention, favoring faith healing practices instead. Their beliefs can lead to tragic situations, especially when it comes to medical care for children.

In other words, they were all very supportive (some acting as advocates) and compassionate and understood the importance and seriousness of my illness. Even when I was unable to care for my young children at the time, ( I was a single mother) my Christian friends stepped in and made sure they were well taken care of until I could heal and make better decisions for my children and myself while under a doctor's care and supervision.

He was hospitalized after throwing himself down stairs as a suicide attempt. After evaluation, meds were prescribed and he was released. He started to feel'normal' and stopped meds. Disasterous results. Psychotic flair. He couldn't sleep. Eat. Bath. Attend classes. Back on meds. Repeat cycle.
Each relapse worse than previous. Months of off again. Reevaluate. Adjust meds. Medical leave from university. Eventually, he accepted the facts that this is a life long disorder. If he wanted any chance of success, he needed to be on meds. It took time. His diagnosis was adjusted to schitzoeffective disorder — schizophrenia with bipolar. Resuming classes was fine until midterm exams which triggered episodic breakdowns. He opted to withdraw after a serious of repeated meltdowns.
At this point, he has been on medication for half of his life. He is diligent with follow up/continued care protocol. He recently relocated half way across the country. Has a job he loves his own apartment and,easy access to hiking trails. He is happy.
He has even talked to parents who are facing their young adult family member’s diagnosis to help them understand.

103,"Good question - and probably one of the reasons that they are moving to a spectrum of schizophrenia as opposed to rigid linear differentiation.
Typically when viewed at by the public, schizoaffective is viewed like schizophrenia-lite. There’s nothing “lite” about it. What it lacks for in theoretical intensity in terms of schizophrenic symptoms, it adds the hell of bipolar to make it a truly awful experience.
Schizophrenia can and often does have comorbid mental illnesses tagging along - such as OCD or depression. The difference is often determined to be that with schizoaffective psychotic symptoms typically only come during mania and/or depression. Again - you should see why this is not a “lite” anything. Yes it may not be constant, but it makes up for it when it hits. EDIT: it was pointed out quite correctly that no, schizoaffective is diagnosed if psychosis can be independent of mood disorder symptoms. It still may not may be as persistent, but it can happen at any time.
With my schizophrenia I can an also expect psychosis at any time, independently of my depression or OCD. I’m also a bit more likely to be treatment resistant and delusional- which conversely is one of the hardest symptoms to treat. There can be greater cognition loss with schizophrenia as well.

Mood (affective) disturbance is not typically a feature and affect normally, is flat, blunted or absent.
Schizoaffective disorder combines some of the elements of schizophrenia, typically delusions or auditory hallucinations with emotional instability and mood swings. It can be difficult for the clinician to differentiate schizoaffective disorder from Bipolar 1 disorder. There are also two types of schizoaffective d/o.",schizophrenia
105,"My partner’s psychiatrist described the difference between bipolar and schizoaffective—as the distinction pertained to him—as bipolar psychosis only occurring during mania and schizoaffective disorder having psychosis possible all the time.
Both bipolar and schizoaffective disorder have the same mood spikes and lulls, but the times when delusions and hallucinations appear are more varied in schizoaffective disorder than bipolar.
The Opera Of The Seas by Margaret MacDonald. Public domain.
She described schizophrenia as having the same at-all-mood-level psychosis as schizoaffective, but without the extreme bipolar mood swings.
The mood swings of schizoaffective disorder may lead to fewer negative symptoms than seen in typical schizophrenia overall. You can’t really be manic and have a blank affect. You certainly won’t encounter avolition while manic or hypomanic. But all these things may be wholly present at other times.
My understanding, rooted in her discussion, is that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are basically the same aside from the affective elements that distinguish one disorder from the other.",schizophrenia
106,"It can be, but it isn't always.

To start with, schizophrenia can be a more severe mental illness than itself. That sounds absurd, but hear me out.

The criteria used to define schizophrenia are very broad, so much so that two people can have almost no symptoms in common and still be given the same diagnosis. One person might hear quiet, non-distressing voices and become socially withdrawn over a period of 6 months, and they could be diagnosed with schizophrenia. Another person might be utterly convinced that the Earth is about to explode and hallucinate the voices of a dozen people shouting abuse at them, but be too lacking in personal motivation to even feed themselves. To make it even more complicated, that second patient could possibly respond really well to antipsychotic medication and live a normal life, while the first patient gets really severe side effects while barely changing his symptoms.

For schizoaffective disorder to be diagnosed, a person needs to effectively meet the criteria for schizophrenia as well as those for either a major depressive episode or a manic episode. Their psychosis can be episodic rather than chronic, but they need to have had two episodes in that case, and they can't have had psychotic symptoms only when they were suffering from mood symptoms; there needs to be at least a two week period of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms. Otherwise, the diagnosis given should be depression/mania with psychotic features.

On the face of it, since schizoaffective disorder is essentially schizophrenia plus a mood disorder, you would expect it to be more severe. However, the fact is that both disorders have a broad range of severity, and that range overlaps considerably, so if you were to randomly pick one person with each disorder it's basically an even chance that either one will have a more debilitating illness than the other.

The comparison should always be made on a case-by-case basis.

Schizophrenia is a thought disorder
Schizo affective is a mood and psychotic disorder
Schizophrenia is a serious disorder which affects how a person thinks, feels and acts. Someone with schizophrenia may have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary; may be unresponsive or withdrawn; and may have difficulty expressing normal emotions in social situations.
“Schizoaffective disorder” is one of the more common, chronic, and disabling mental illnesses. As the name implies, it is characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and an affective (mood) disorder. There has been a controversy about whether schizoaffective disorder is a type of schizophrenia or a type of mood disorder. Today, most clinicians and researchers agree that it is primarily a form of schizophrenia. Although its exact prevalence is not clear, it may range from two to five in a thousand people (- i.e., 0.2% to 0.5%). Schizoaffective disorder may account for one-fourth or even one-third of all persons with schizophrenia.",schizophrenia

If you're wondering if there is any benefit to having schizoaffective disorder over schizophrenia, I'd say no because schizoaffective disorder is kind of like having both schizophrenia AND bi-polar disorder depending on what type of schizoaffective disorder you have.
If you're wondering if there is any benefit to having schizoaffective on its own, I'd say it gives you the ability to sense things that others don't, like an empath. You may find meaning and depth in the world of art, poetry, music; a sensitivity to vibrations.

Almost every schizophrenic whom I have evaluated over the past five years or so has been misdiagnosed as ‘bipolar’ (oops, schizoaffective?). And almost every borderline personality disorder patient I have seen in the past few years has been misdiagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (oops, what the hell?)
According to the recent DSM iterations, schizoaffective disorder is different from schizophrenia in that there have to be discrete episodes of either mania or depression, somehow apart from the schizophrenia, and for at least two weeks. Good luck teasing that out. And as to why such should not be diagnosed as schizophrenia and depression, or schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, there is no explanation. And what about ‘depression with psychotic features’, or ‘bipolar disorder with psychotic features’? Two other diagnostic categories.

Delusions: false beliefs that are not based in reality

Disordered thinking and speech: jumbled or illogical thoughts that can make communication difficult
Negative symptoms: such as a lack of emotion, motivation, or social interest
Abnormal behavior: such as strange or repetitive movements.
These symptoms can disrupt a person's ability to lead a normal life and make it difficult for them to function in daily activities, such as work, school, and personal relationships.
Schizoaffective disorder, on the other hand, is a mental health condition that combines symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder. People with schizoaffective disorder experience symptoms of both psychosis (e.g. delusions, hallucinations) and a disturbance in their mood or affect (e.g. depression or mania).

Schizoaffective Disorder (a psychotic disorder) is NOT the same thing as Schizoid Personality Disorder (a personality disorder) aka they are two different disorders. The confusion probably occurred because the original question miswrote the condition as “schizoid affective disorder”. There are several disorders that begin with “schizo” so there is a lot of confusion RE differentiating these disorders.
The disorder you are asking about, original question-asker, is called “Schizoaffective Disorder”. This disorder is a hybrid of Schizophrenia plus a mood disorder like Bipolar Disorder or Depression. (Psychologists use the term “affect” to refer to moods or emotional states.)
Both Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder are psychotic disorders. The main or defining characteristic of psychotic disorders is having breaks with reality (difficulty being able to distinguish what is objectively real from what is subjective or imaginary) which usually includes hallucinations and/or delusional beliefs.
There are comprehensive, detailed articles about both Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective disorder at the Mayo Clinic website.

116,"I used to just think of schizoaffective disorder as schizophrenia + bipolar disorder, but you can be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder even if the mood piece is just depression, without the mania that goes along with bipolar.
That is why there are two types of schizoaffective disorder.
Bipolar type
Depressive type
I have also seen “mixed” type, but I’m not sure exactly how that is in any way different from bipolar type. It seems redundant to me.
Supposedly, this condition is rare, but I can assure you, it shows up in a patient’s chart as a diagnosis far too commonly to be considered “rare,” unless everywhere I have worked it’s just being massively misdiagnosed, which I suspect is the case.
For a while, like around 2014–2015, it seemed like every other person who was admitted to the acute-care inpatient psychiatric facility where I worked received that diagnosis on the General Adult unit, and that is just statistically impossible.
The general premise of schizoaffective disorder is the presence of depression (and in some cases, mania) in addition to the symptoms of schizophrenia. The thing I’ve never quite understood, is that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (hallucinations, delusions, etc.) are what is targeted by antipsychotic medications. The negative symptoms, or the “lack” of something (joy, motivation, interest in socializing, speaking, etc) are not generally affected by antipsychotic medications, and leave a schizophrenic patient, even one who is compliant with their meds, depressed, and in need of a second line of treatment.
Right there you can see that depression is inherent in many schizophrenic patients. The comorbidity rate has to be at least 50–75%, and if you’ve ever seen a homeless person with schizophrenia (and if you’ve come across more than 5 homeless people, then you’ve seen one with schizophrenia), you know that many are manic in their behaviors—potentially due to the positive symptoms? Maybe.
My point is, these mood issues are prevalent in patients with schizophrenia, so unless their mood issues are causing their symptoms to look drastically different from your average schizophrenic (which would be rare), then why the need to have a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis at all?
Clinicians can always add a qualifier to someone’s schizophrenia diagnosis if any of their symptoms are more pronounced than others, and most of the patients I’ve encountered with a schizoaffective disorder diagnosis did not appear to me to be schizophrenic—they usually present as bipolar.
I am not able to make a diagnosis, but I am intelligent enough to notice patterns, and when it comes to schizoaffective disorder, the only patten I’ve seen is a clinician’s tendency to misdiagnose. Whether that’s because it was the new, trendy diagnosis there for a while, or there were insurance/billing perks to it, is anyone’s guess.
All I know is, the diagnosis has accomplished nothing of value clinically that I have seen.",schizophrenia

Schizoaffective disorder is divided into two mood disorder types: bipolar or depressive. The bipolar type is distinguished by symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes; the depressive type by symptoms of depression exclusively. [1]

Schizophrenia itself is not a mood disorder. See: Is schizophrenia considered a mood disorder? for more. Schizophrenia is defined as
…a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown in thinking and poor emotional responses. Common symptoms include delusions, such as paranoia; hearing voices or noises that are not there; disorganized thinking; a lack of emotion and a lack of motivation. [2]

123,"The primary difference is the mood issues that rise up in schizoaffective. I think schizophrenics have it worse off symptom wise. A lot of my day to day problems are from emotional regulation. I still have paranoia and delusions from the schizo stuff. I see spots float around, and that stuff that's always in the corner of your eye if you know what I mean.
The benefits is that I have a pretty good sense of when I'm in actual danger. Personally I'm good in crisis situations. I don't know if that is because of schizoaffective though. I've learned compassion and forgiveness through having it. I try to be kind to everyone as best I can.
I hope that helps answer your question.",schizophrenia
124,"My husband was diagnosed as bipolar by a few different doctors, and was well managed by lithium. When he developed symptoms of full blown paranoid schizophrenia, he was then diagnosed as schizoaffective. Schizoaffective means you have symptoms of both bipolar and schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
125,"Schizophrenic people aren’t dangerous like the movies like to make people believe.
Most of them are never alone… EVER…
Schizophrenic people don’t have two personalities like movies want you to believe. that’s Dissociative identity disorder.
Schizophrenia can get debilitating with the constant voices yelling at you. and the hallucinations
Being properly Treated by a doctor. It’s possible to live a Semi normal life like before you got it.
There’s no cure for schizophrenia
Exercising will not cure schizophrenia
You don’t need to be scared of a Schizophrenia person. You’ve probably been near one or worked with one before and never knew.
Schizophrenics take medicine for life unless they can manage the symptoms themselves.
Voices are generally outside the head like if you were taking your friend

126,"Fact 1: Schizophrenia is not a split personality disorder, despite what you may have seen in movies or heard through the grapevine. It's a complex mental illness characterized by a range of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and emotional withdrawal.
Fact 2: Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the global population, which means millions of people worldwide are dealing with this condition. It doesn't discriminate based on gender, race, or social status.
Fact 3: While the exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, research suggests that a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors may contribute to its development. It's like a puzzle with multiple pieces, and scientists are working hard to put it all together.
Fact 4: Contrary to popular belief, individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators. Media portrayals often stigmatize the condition, leading to misconceptions and unfair stereotypes. Let's break that stigma, shall we?

127,"Schizophrenia is a topic that, whenever it comes up, always seems to captivate and sometimes unsettle the room. I remember a friend, deeply fascinated by psychology, who shared some truly mind-blowing facts about schizophrenia that challenged many of our common misconceptions and opened our eyes to the complexity of this condition. Let me pass along some of that awe-inspiring information:
It's Not About Multiple Personalities: Many people confuse schizophrenia with dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder). Schizophrenia involves a range of symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, but it doesn't cause someone to switch between distinct personalities.
Genetics and Environment Play a Role: Research indicates that schizophrenia is caused by a combination of genetic, brain chemistry, and environmental factors. If someone has a first-degree relative with schizophrenia, their chances of developing the condition significantly increase, though it's not a guarantee.
Early Treatment Can Make a Huge Difference: Like many mental health conditions, early intervention and treatment of schizophrenia can drastically improve long-term outcomes. Treatment usually includes a combination of medication and therapy tailored to each individual's needs.
It's More Common Than You Might Think: Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the population worldwide. Considering the global population, that's a significant number of people, making it one of the more common serious mental health conditions.
Schizophrenia Symptoms Can Be Categorized: Symptoms are often divided into three categories - positive (additions to thought processes such as hallucinations and delusions), negative (subtractions from a person's abilities, such as reduced emotion and motivation), and cognitive (impacts on memory and concentration).
The Condition Was Once Known as 'Dementia Praecox': Before the term schizophrenia was coined in the early 20th century by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, the condition was referred to as 'dementia praecox', which means 'premature dementia.' Bleuler introduced the term schizophrenia to emphasize the split between the person’s thinking, emotion, and behavior.
Worldwide Variation in Treatment and Prognosis: Studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia in developing countries often fare better over time than those in developed countries, which has led to significant discussion about the role of social support, family structure, and expectations in recovery.
Innovation in Treatment: Advances in treatment, including newer antipsychotic medications with fewer side effects and integrated care models that combine psychiatric services with social and employment support, are continually improving the quality of life for those with schizophrenia.
This friend always stresses the importance of understanding and compassion when discussing mental health. Schizophrenia, with its complexities and nuances, is a stark reminder of the human brain's fragility and resilience. It's a condition that challenges us to look beyond our assumptions and strive for a deeper understanding of mental health.",schizophrenia
128,"1. Schizophrenia is a highly disabling and costly medical disorder. In fact, it is ranked among the main conditions contributing to the global burden of disease.
2. Schizophrenia involves positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms, such as flattened affect, cognitive impairment and lack of motivation.
3. The prevalence of schizophrenia is thought to be around 1%, even though some papers show smaller numbers (0,6%, 0,33-0,75% etc.). Its incidence is similar across many countries.
4. The first symptoms usually start in the late teens or early adulthood. Rarely schizophrenia starts in childhood or in the elderly.
5. Proportionally more men are diagnosed than women (1,4:1). Men’s age of onset is earlier than women’s and their prognosis is worse.
6. Anxiety, depression and substance abuse prevalence is higher among schizophrenic patients compared to the general population.
7. People with schizophrenia have higher rates of suicide.
8. Living in cities, being an immigrant, obstetrical complications, late winter birth and advanced or younger paternal age are risk factors for schizophrenia.
9. Approximately 15-20% of the schizophrenic patients have the so-called deficit schizophrenia, a syndrome characterized by prominent negative symptoms. These patients have less addictions, depression and suicide rates, and less positive symptoms, such as dellusions and hallucinations.
10. No one knows exactly the etiology of schizophrenia. Nowadays, schizophrenia is thought of as an umbrella term which includes different diseases with different pathophysiologies and similar symptoms.
11. Concordance rates of schizophrenia in monozygotic twins range from 40 to 50%. Concordance rates in dizygotic twins range from 10 to 15 %.
12. We can conclude that schizophrenia really has genetic factors involved in its etiology, but they certainly do not explain all the pathogenesis. This study shows that 87% of the risk comes from genetic factors, while the remaining 13% comes from the environment. One of the most famous and well studied genes is the one that encodes the COMT enzyme.
13. There are associations between schizophrenia and genes of the major histocompatibility complex, which has immune functions. That supports the idea of some immunological etiology for schizophrenia.
14. Influenza during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of developing schizophrenia (for the fetus).
15. Cannabis smokers might be at higher risk of developing schizophrenia. In fact, smoking cannabis might cause paranoia and other psychotic symptoms even in healthy subjects.
16. Antipsychotics, the main treatment for schizophrenia, are antagonists of the D2 dopaminergic receptor. That is the same system activated by cocaine, amphetamines, and all the other recreational drugs.
17. More than 80% of the patients have delusions. Delusions are fixed beliefs that resist even massive contradictory evidence.
18. Hallucinations are perceptions that don’t correlate with real stimuli from the environment. Delusions might serve partly as a subjective explanation for the hallucinations.
19. Schizophrenia is a chronic disease. Some patients are able to lead relatively normal lives, but most of them are permanently highly disabled.
20. John Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel laureate, was schizophrenic. The picture A beautiful mind, starring Russell Crowe, is based on his life.
20 facts about schizophrenia",schizophrenia
129,"Here are ten to start with:
.
ONE — “Schizophrenia” is not a single entity. It is an entire scope of similar and very dissimilar experiences and states which cannot be characterized through common physical or functional traits. It is quintessentially a psychosocial concept, not a deduction of medical science, and has no accountability to physical evidences or biological features.
.
TWO — “Schizophrenia” is not a physical illness, and may not involve any true pathology. There are sometimes clear differences in particular individuals, but these are not uniform across all persons and there is no strong evidence these differences comprise some sort of disease or neurological brokenness. Any time a physical pathology is discerned, someone ceases to be considered “schizophrenic”—medical science steps in.
.
THREE — Many physical problems are misdiagnosed as “schizophrenia”. Some examples include: vitamin deficiencies, drug-related changes, neurodegenerative conditions, mitochondrial diseases, physical brain damages or malformations from things like stroke and congenital conditions, seizure conditions, various infections, auto-immune problems.
.
FOUR — The drugs given to people diagnosed as “schizophrenic” can cause all the experiences attributed to diagnoses of schizophrenia. They can cause immediate, delayed, short term, and long term symptoms. Doctors quite commonly mistake these drug-induced effects as “mental illness”, especially since there is no way to objectively test for “mental illness” in the first place, much less after brain-altering drugs have been administered (or forced upon someone).
.
FIVE — The same drugs given to people who have no history of those experiences can lead to them being misdiagnosed as “schizophrenia-spectrum”. This is especially common when they are part of withdrawal syndromes. The range of possible neuropsychiatric effects of drugs like antipsychotics and antidepressants are not contingent upon someone’s physical health or psychological history. Even persons deemed fully healthy can have ‘psychotomimetic’ reactions or persistent drug-induced neuropsychiatric effects.
.
SIX — Antipsychotics are chemical lobotomies which stop the brain from working correctly. They are not a “cure” or even a specific “treatment” for experiences attributed to “schizophrenia”. That does not mean they can never be useful, they are just nothing like antibiotics for an infection or a splint for a broken arm or insulin for someone with diabetes. They also carry far greater risks in addition to failing to provide any specific and targeted address of experienced grouped as “schizophrenia”.
.
SEVEN — Drugs are not imperative for people who self-identify as “schizophrenic”. There are many ways to live a higher quality, more functional life, and drugs are never required. For a minority of patients, they can sometimes seem like the easiest route of those limitedly available, and that is just fine. As long as there is informed consent, an availability of alternatives, and benefits that outweigh the harms and risks, the free decision to use dangerous substances is not a blight—agency matters.
.
EIGHT — Those three things (informed consent, an availability of alternatives, and benefits that outweigh the harms and risks) are commonly lacking, however. Preventable harms are disturbingly pervasive, and the changes in the medical industry that have been developing for the past several decades are most often furthering rather than closing the gap between ‘ideal care’ and the care actually being offered.
.
NINE — Diagnoses and diagnostic paradigms are not benign. Institutional labels, social regard, and pathologizing language can all cause harm. Insisting that any one subjective theory of human experience should override all alternatives regardless of what results from that hegemony is both unethical and responsible for causing a net worsening in the lives of people that would be labeled “schizophrenic”. Popular culture and many well-meaning citizens are caught up in marketing rather than addressing people as individuals.
.
TEN — You don’t know who someone is, what they experience, or why simply based on a psychosocial label or the opinions of supposed “experts” in a field who have never even been considered “psychotic” or taken psychiatric drugs on a regular basis. Making assumptions sometimes feels easier or more appropriate when there are delegated labels and tidy categories to fit people into, but real life does not actually work that way even if it seems coherent ‘on paper’—and it shouldn’t seem that way in the first place if you expect consistency and logical support.",schizophrenia
130,"Negative symptoms (apathy, tiredness, lack of motivation) are cause more disabilities than the positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia). Especially as these can increase with age and antipsychotics can make these worse and only tend to help positive symptoms. During an episode positive symptoms are more prominent and noticeable though.
people with schizophrenia are 17 times more likely to be victims of an attack than a perporator. Certainly more likely to harm themselves than others.
People with it tend to die on average 10–20 years younger mainly due to metabolic disorders which can be as a result of medication like weight gain, diabetes. Also far more likely to smoke and die from smoking related diseases.",schizophrenia
131,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
132,"Schizophrenia is indeed a complex and multifaceted condition. Here are some fascinating facts about it:
1> Not Split Personality: Despite common misconceptions, schizophrenia doesn’t refer to having a split personality. It’s a severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.
2> Diverse Symptoms: Symptoms of schizophrenia vary widely among individuals and can include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, lack of motivation, and social withdrawal.
3> Brain Differences: Studies have shown that there are structural and functional differences in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia compared to those without. These differences can involve various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus.
4> Genetic Component: While the exact cause of schizophrenia is not fully understood, genetics is believed to play a significant role. Individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with schizophrenia have a higher risk of developing the disorder themselves.
5> Environmental Factors: Environmental factors such as prenatal exposure to toxins, maternal malnutrition during pregnancy, and stressful life events may also contribute to the development of schizophrenia.
6> Onset: Schizophrenia typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood, although it can occur at any age. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes.
7> Not Always Chronic: While schizophrenia is often portrayed as a chronic condition, some individuals experience single episodes or have periods of remission where symptoms are minimal or absent.
8> Treatment Challenges: Managing schizophrenia can be challenging, and treatment usually involves a combination of antipsychotic medications, psychotherapy, and support services. However, finding the right treatment approach can take time, and not all individuals respond well to medication.
9> Creativity Connection: There’s a debated link between schizophrenia and creativity. Some studies suggest that individuals with schizophrenia may be more likely to pursue creative professions, such as art, music, or writing. However, the relationship between creativity and schizophrenia is complex and not fully understood.
10> Stigma and Misconceptions: Despite advances in understanding and treating schizophrenia, stigma and misconceptions surrounding the disorder persist. Education and awareness are crucial in combating stigma and promoting understanding and support for individuals living with schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
133,"I take medication for my schizophrenia/psychosis and they work. However before finding my medication combination that worked, I could “feel myself” about to be actively psychotic. Yes! We can typically give you or someone else warning we will be going down hill. So, I went to a nurse and asked for what is known as “a PRN”. This means i asked the nurse for medication to help. When that medication started to work I had been actively psychotic for a half hour of psychosis. I then passed out and woke up for dinner hours later and act as if nothing ever happened.
Theres whats called a mask test. I will always be able to tell you whether the mask is about to be put on your face or not. Thats just one of my super powers. Our brains functioning is so much different from other peoples that not only will i not fall for this test..

135,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

136,"Approximately half of people with schizophrenia will have issues at some point in their lives with over-consumption of fluids. This is called polydipsia and can be very dangerous. Drinking too much dilutes the blood down resulting in a serious electrolyte imbalance, the most common of which is hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is a dangerously low level of sodium, which can lead to death if not addressed. Individuals with severe polydipsia will go to extreme lengths to seek fluids, some even resorting to drinking their own urine when other fluids are limited (as in institutional settings).
I used to teach inpatient and long-term care staff about this topic. Since the 2nd generation antipsychotics have been introduced, some individuals have shown significant improvement of polydipsia while others continue to struggle.",schizophrenia
137,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia

An interesting fact is that people being in cult groups where they study the paranormal have the same symptoms. You could say those things are related. It is likely that people who suffer from illnesses being in a cult in the past are suffering from a form of schizophrenia where the illness has been abused by someone rather than actually have been in a cult or anything. That done by some kind of psychiatric evil genius that is probably trying to mind upload it’s original members. The cases where people hallucinate are many and they always ironically linked to the devil or things like that. Like doing drugs. You also hallucinate. And now that drugs are turning legal slowly through alternative therapies people are also calling alternative therapies heretic or part of the devil. You could say from those facts schizophrenia is actually a very common illness ignored by people over the ages over the excuse of underdeveloped science or things like that due to religious beliefs or religion generally keeping people back from seeing the truth. All these link to schizophrenia. You can’t say they are actually facts. More like observations but they sure are mind-blowing. It’s just an opinion that says that 90% of the population worldwide is schizophrenic in reality and being abused over that fact. The facts are that in all those cases you hallucinate like a schizophrenic. So for a primitive person in all those cases you are schizophrenic.,schizophrenia
139,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.
Update 15/11/14
Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
140,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
141,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.

143,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a fairly common and debilitating mental illness. Learn more about its causes, symptoms, types, and treatments.

Schizophrenia: An Overview
Medically Reviewed by Smitha Bhandari, MD on January 21, 2020
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe mental disorder that affects the way a person thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality, and relates to others. Though schizophrenia isn’t as common as other major mental illnesses, it can be the most chronic and disabling.
People with schizophrenia often have problems doing well in society, at work, at school, and in relationships. They might feel frightened and withdrawn, and could appear to have lost touch with reality. This lifelong disease can’t be cured but can be controlled with proper treatment.
Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia is not a split or multiple personality. Schizophrenia involves a psychosis, a type of mental illness in which a person can’t tell what’s real from what’s imagined. At times, people with psychotic disorders lose touch with reality. The world may seem like a jumble of confusing thoughts, images, and sounds. Their behavior may be very strange and even shocking. A sudden change in personality and behavior, which happens when people who have it lose touch with reality, is called a psychotic episode.
How severe schizophrenia is varies from person to person. Some people have only one psychotic episode, while others have many episodes during a lifetime but lead relatively normal lives in between. Still others may have more trouble functioning over time, with little improvement between full-blown psychotic episodes. Schizophrenia symptoms seem to worsen and improve in cycles known as relapses and remissions.
What Are the Early Symptoms of Schizophrenia?
The condition usually shows its first signs in men in their late teens or early 20s. It mostly affects women in their early 20s and 30s. The period when symptoms first start and before full psychosis is called the prodromal period. It can last days, weeks, or even years. It can be hard to spot because there’s usually no specific trigger. You might only notice subtle behavioral changes, especially in teens. This includes:
A change in grades
Social withdrawal
Trouble concentrating
Temper flares
Difficulty sleeping
Positive Symptoms of Schizophrenia
In this case, the word positive doesn’t mean good. It refers to added thoughts or actions that aren’t based in reality. They’re sometimes called psychotic symptoms and can include:
Delusions: These are false, mixed, and sometimes strange beliefs that aren’t based in reality and that the person refuses to give up, even when shown the facts. For example, a person with delusions may believe that people can hear their thoughts, that they are God or the devil, or that people are putting thoughts into their head or plotting against them.
Hallucinations: These involve sensations that aren't real. Hearing voices is the most common hallucination in people with schizophrenia. The voices may comment on the person's behavior, insult them, or give commands. Less common types include seeing things that aren't there, smelling strange odors, having a funny taste in your mouth, and feeling sensations on your skin even though nothing is touching your body.
Catatonia: In this condition, the person may stop speaking, and their body may be fixed in a single position for a very long time.
Disorganized Symptoms of Schizophrenia
These are positive symptoms that show that the person can’t think clearly or respond as expected. Examples include:
Talking in sentences that don’t make sense or using nonsense words, making it difficult for the person to communicate or hold a conversation
Shifting quickly from one thought to the next without obvious or logical connections between them
Moving slowly
Being unable to make decisions
Writing excessively but without meaning
Forgetting or losing things
Repeating movements or gestures, like pacing or walking in circles
Having problems making sense of everyday sights, sounds, and feelings
Cognitive Symptoms of Schizophrenia
The person will have trouble:
Understanding information and using it to make decisions (a doctor might call this poor executive functioning)
Focusing or paying attention
Using their information immediately after learning it (this is called working memory)
Recognizing that they have any of these problems
Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia
The word ""negative"" here doesn’t mean ""bad."" It notes the absence of normal behaviors in people with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include:
Lack of emotion or a limited range of emotions
Withdrawal from family, friends, and social activities
Less energy
Speaking less
Lack of motivation
Loss of pleasure or interest in life
Poor hygiene and grooming habits
What Causes Schizophrenia?
The exact cause of schizophrenia isn’t known. But like cancer and diabetes, schizophrenia is a real illness with a biological basis. Researchers have uncovered a number of things that appear to make someone more likely to get schizophrenia, including:
Genetics (heredity): Schizophrenia can run in families, which means a greater likelihood to have schizophrenia may be passed on from parents to their children.
Brain chemistry and circuits: People with schizophrenia may not be able to regulate brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that control certain pathways, or ""circuits,"" of nerve cells that affect thinking and behavior.
Brain abnormality: Research has found abnormal brain structure in people with schizophrenia. But this doesn’t apply to all people with schizophrenia. It can affect people without the disease.
Environment: Things like viral infections, exposure to toxins like marijuana, or highly stressful situations may trigger schizophrenia in people whose genes make them more likely to get the disorder. Schizophrenia more often surfaces when the body is having hormonal and physical changes, like those that happen during the teen and young adult years.
Who Gets Schizophrenia?
Anyone can get schizophrenia. It affects people all over the world, from all races and cultures. While it can happen at any age, schizophrenia typically first appears in the teenage years or early 20s. The disorder affects men and women equally, although symptoms generally appear earlier in men. The earlier the symptoms start, the more severe the illness tends to be. Children over the age of 5 can have schizophrenia, but it’s rare before adolescence.",schizophrenia
145,"You can relapse at any day.
You can lose control of your anger.
You can have disorganised speeches which people would not understand like what are you talking about are you drunk?
Taking your medicine is very important.

147,"Ooh. Good question. I'm going to tell you a bit about someone I consider my second son . I've known him about thirty years
He's kind,he's funny,he's generous, he's honest ,he's thoughtful, he's considerate, he's trustworthy. He's wonderful!
I'm disabled now . He's visits me and hoovers,mops the floors ,goes to the shop for me,baths my dog etc. Takes me out in the wheelchair sometimes. Does all the things I used to take for granted but can't do now. Nothing's too much trouble for him. He's a lovely young man
Have I mentioned he's schizophrenic?
It really makes me angry when people talk rubbish about schizophrenia. My lad does sometimes have illogical thoughts ,his reality is sometimes slightly different to other people's,his anxiety is bad at times, he gets fixated on things. . But he's not an axe wielding madman. He's not going to attack anyone or hurt them Far from it. There's only one person he's a danger to at times. And that's himself
I'm proud to think of him as my son",schizophrenia
148,"I started hearing voices when I was about 29 and I do indeed have a schizophrenia diagnosis. Some advantages:
When you start hearing voices you become able to see other perspectives MUCH easier. You think about the world in a new way and can see paths or solutions that others might not.
You also never feel alone. The voices have consciousness and volition so yes you can have a conversation with them. (The negative side of this is you lose your privacy, but it’s something you can get used to. For example the voices might comment on your body in the shower or shame you if you wish to masturbate.)
I don’t know if this one is specific to me or not, but I became able to tolerate physical pain better. I’ve been in the hospital about to have something painful done and was able to go back into my head with the voices to not feel it as much. (Distraction I guess.)
The voices can also cause physical sensations both good and bad. So the good sensations would be an advantage I think. (These are like electrical currents running through your body.)",schizophrenia
149,"Speaking from personal experience of 18+ years (Schizophrenia + BPD) I think my mental illnesses have made me a stronger, better, more compassionate person.
Sure, it may have pulled me back for several years but I've learned to cope with my schizophrenia. I hear voices. I see things. They get pretty disturbing. But they are part of me and I accept that. I'm not anti-depressant or anti-psychotic med tolerant so I am unmedicated for it. I talk to my voices and visual hallucinations (when alone) and it makes me feel less lonely sometimes.
Sometimes I just need to vent feelings and they go away. Sometimes they are things I think I want to hear from people, sometimes nice but not always. Sometimes its just company. Even if whatever it is is a little creepy, if I'm completely honest.
Voices can be overwhelming and confusing, making it difficult to sleep at times but I merely put music in till they shut up or I literally tell them to shut up. And 95% of the time, which ever way I get them to stop, they cease in less than 5 minutes (or roughly 1-2 song times) and I'm asleep.
And physical sensations? Yeah. Not always the best, can be startling. It can feel like someone is rubbing my head lightly (something I love). Other times it can feel like theres light electric impulses going through my body at random intervals, or something that feels like what you think a staticy screen channel feels like. Not bad but not good.
I have incredible dreams and visions, they can be absolutely stunning in detail and color. I have watched one of my precious dogs, Isaac, who died of diabetes, be healthy and happy and play with many other dog in Heaven. It was joyous to watch because he suffered so bad and so long. It makes my heart full when I think back on it. I've had dreams where I’ve gone to Heaven 3xs. If I had the gift to paint, I would have tried but probably never actually been able to do it justice. The colors I saw can't be duplicated, nothing man made will ever look that stunning!
Also. It may not look like it here. But I am a fantastic writer. I am VERY creative and passionate in my work. I write fiction purely for entertainment p...

150,"I'm a ""high functioning"" schizophrenic. Growing up I was always ""off"" as far as the rest of my family was concerned. I started hallucinating my freshman year of high school. They were mediocre idiots that never graduated high school. Forget about college or a career. They either became housewives, cheap manual labor, or felons. Not me. From an early age I always asked ""why?"" Why would they do this shit to themselves? Why are they ""happy"" in such unfulfilled miserable lives? Why were they always trying to convince me getting knocked up during/right after high school was such a great thing???
It was all lies. They just wanted me to be a dumb druggy welfare queen like them. Misery loves company.
In junior high I was hallucinating and delusional. I became absorbed in fantasy novels. I taught myself how to read when I was eleven years old. Those novels were just like what was going on in my head. They were just as ""crazy"" as me. But they opened the door to an education. By high school I was reading at university level. I aced a public servant test at 16 and got a county job. I beat most of the adults in the room. Even at math.
All of this led to me eventually finding my way to university. I ended up double majoring in criminal psychology and culinary (couldn't make up my mind). I went on to manage a $62 million dollar property. Then I had my first major hospitalization burning my bridges and destroying my career.
Some say the career loss is a bad thing. Hell no! At least I was different from the herd and TRIED. If I was ""sane"" I probably would have been happy working at KFC until the flavor of the week knocked me up. Being ""off"" also gave me the strength to cut those people out of my life. I'm better for it. My best friend has power of attorney for me and handles my finances. It's all good.",schizophrenia
151,"One can only answer for individuals, not for labels.
“Schizophrenia” is not a specific or objective physical phenomenon, so there is no way to coherently organize people as being either “schizophrenic” or “not schizophrenic”. Thus, there is no way to answer your question from an objective or scientific viewpoint because the difference between the two groups of people is arbitrary and inconsistent. Whether we are dealing with “good things” or “bad things”, it is simply impossible to connect anything to “schizophrenia” in such a sweeping or specific way.
No experiences nor traits can be consistently stated as accompanying “schizophrenia”. This is not just because “schizophrenia” is not a label used consistently, but also because individuality precludes the level of uniformity you might be asking about here. So, even if there are “good things” to speak of, they are endemic to individuals rather than “having schizophrenia”, especially because most experiences ultimately have a multifactoral set of causes. Speaking from the position of individual experiences, though, this does become an answerable question.
We have to keep in mind, though, that these experiences may not apply to everyone, if they apply to more than just a few people in the first place, and that their connection to “having schizophrenia” is both complex and not strictly deterministic. Experiences, preferences, goals, priorities, and influences all differ across persons and situations. Verily, what is “good” to one person may not at all be “good” to another. And it also stands to be said that many “things” are neither strictly good nor bad, but rather having the potential to be one or the other or both depending on circumstances and intentions.
Here are some things that some persons self-identifying with the label “schizophrenia” have mentioned being “good” and somehow connected to what they are considering “schizophrenia”:
Creativity — ideas, drive, enjoyment, expression, uniqueness
Insight — seeing things that others do not, whether about self, the universe, philosophy, practical fields, etc
Perspective — experiencing and seeing in ways that the average person generally does not, and the ramifications of having that understanding
Spirituality — differences in the aforementioned categories, passion, depth or meaningfulness of experiences
Interpersonal empowerment — the ability to offer things to other people which are not provided by more ‘typical’ persons and life experiences
Flexibility — having a greater range of experiences and perspectives can lead to an increased maturity, flexibility, and awareness for some people
Restating, it would be inaccurate to say that any of these things are things that “come with having schizophrenia”. No traits or experiences meet that bill because “schizophrenia” is not something with objective, standardized, or universalized traits. “Schizophrenia” is just a label, and any person can be given that label at some point in their lives, depending on circumstances. It does not magically determine anything about how someone experiences life, and we cannot know anything about what someone experiences simply based on the fact of their being given that label, presently or previously.",schizophrenia
152,"I had an awesome time as a child. any bare surface, I could see wriggling animated drawing. I was also pretty sure that many inanimate things really were alive and I could hear their thoughts. This faded by late adolescence and did not cause me much harm as I didn’t really mention it to anyone and it wasn’t that intrusive. Early twenties were pretty dark and depressing, with auditory hallucinations that lasted for over a year. Those were thoroughly unpleasant and nasty as one could not turn them off. I guess you could say I was haunted. Also had a couple of breakdowns with serious visual & auditory hallucinations. Not sure I could have handled those for long. So I guess as long as it’s not too severe, it’s actually on the delightful side. Like waking dreaming. I suppose it also predisposes one to being alone as the things you see and hear are often more intriguing than what’s out there. But it’s also passive: like entertainment handed to you on a platter. I suppose it comes on the same conduits of artistic inspiration (I draw/write/sing and have make quite a living out of the first two) but I’m not sure if the depression came with the schizophrenia or if that is just a separate thing. I have neither anymore. Only dreams. It’s sad. Every blank wall is missing a friend.",schizophrenia
153,"I'm just a twee angry that this question needs answering, but, of course, it does. What are the benefits? I could think of some. In fact, I have. But my first answer to this question is that it doesn't matter whether we can identify any benefits or not.
What matters is that there is a broad range of human behavior, and the reason there is such a broad range of behavior is that you never know when you will need some capability for some circumstance. That is to say that there will be some circumstances where schizophrenic behavior turns out to have a survival advantage. Just because you can't predict it or know it or don't see it doesn't mean it won't happen.
My second answer is that people seek out states of mind that schizophrenics may live in regularly. They'll take LSD and peyote and other plant substances designed to give them hallucinations and open the veil between the ordinary world and visions of other worlds.
I never took LSD. I always had a feeling that if I did, I probably wouldn't come back from my trip. Maybe I was right and maybe not, but there did come a time when they diagnosed me as being one of those people who don't see the world the way others do. I'm not as far out as someone with schizophrenia, but I do surprise people.
Anyway, if ordinary people value those visions, then maybe those visions are also valued in extraordinary people. Personally, I wouldn't go to a schizophrenic oracle, but I would want to learn to see the world differently. A different perspective is key.
People have a horrible term for referring to those who can think and imagine things that others can't. We do value it. Even ordinary people value it. Perfectly normal people realize they need the help of those who are crazy every once in a while -- at those times when you are incapable of think sufficiently wildly.
The odd thing as that you aren't incapable. You've just been shut down for fear of being seen to be crazy. Only the truly crazy are left. It's as if everyone else deliberately pokes their own eyes out. The truth is that there are times when only schizophrenics have eyes. The rest of us are blind.",schizophrenia
154,"THERE ARE NONE (too the individual at least)
Schizophrenia is an odd condition, on the one had it has been ""positively selected for"" through countless generations of human evolution, while on the other, it is a terrible affliction with close to no redeeming qualities.
Conundrum much? Not entirely. For ever person with schizophrenia, there are typically 5 or 6 closely related family members around them, with schizotypal symptoms but otherwise living happy and normal lives. This is largely to do with the way genes are expressed but I won't go into this.
Among some species of plant that grow in extremely saline conditions, there is something known as a ""sacrificial leaf"". This basically means, all the salt that the plant is forced to absorb gets put into a single leaf, which drop off and dies, allowing the rest of the plant to survive. One hypothesis is that Schizophrenia works along this line of logic: that it disables and destroyed the life of an an individual so that the relatives, who would not qualify for diagnosis but may certainly be quite odd in their own way, can yield the benefits of such abnormal through structure. Of course, the individual is not ""chosen"" the way sacrificial leaf is, this is purely a numbers game. Carriers of the schizophrenia related genes may only have a 1/6 chance of developing full blown Schizophrenia, so the family may do quite well at the expense of the unlucky one in six.
As for the direct benefits yielded by the relatives of a Schizophrenic, this is quite complicated and I won't go into it in much detail. But yes, in a very crude way, they may experience introspective realities others would have to ingest psychedelic substances in order to experience. This would have enormous advantages in occupations requiring strong visual/spatial imagination, creative writing, certain kinds of interpersonal skills etc but this is speculation, it has not been studied much.
It's an odd thing with our current mental health system: Either you are ""crazy"" or you are ""sane"". The idea that these disorders actually exist on a spectrum, and that it may be quite beneficial in some cases to sit somewhere towards the middle is unacceptable to many people, even if many others in the field have long suspected it. So yeah, watch this space (neuroscience). We will have these answers within our lifetime.",schizophrenia
155,"There's no actual benefits but we have moments where we enjoy our madness.
Sometimes when I get overly fixated on something small that only exist in my mind it creates some interesting experiences. If I was never open to thinking outside the box I wouldn't have helped my dad fix his cable TV. I told him I'm getting bad vibes from the TV cable and it turned out it was that TV cable making problems. Bad cable mojo. If that was delusional, which it could I still suspend disbelief and if nothing else it's a fun story for my father and me to share.
If there was an actual upside to schizophrenia it would be open minded-ness, but at the same time that is also the source of most of our problems.",schizophrenia
156,"I am constantly tortured 24/7 by auditory hallucinations (yes, in my sleep as well) and I have also experienced painful, uncomfortable, and very strange tactile hallucinations. Teeth being extracted one by one, accompanied by pain and throbbing of the gums? YES. Having my fingers painfully pricked when I touched meat as a vegetarian? YES. The list goes on and on. Wretched and disgusting olfactory hallucinations and absolutely frightening visual hallucinations accompany these. I have passed out due to fright and I have even urinated by accident from the torture.
There is NO BENEFIT TO BEING SCHIZOPHRENIC!!!!!!!! I wouldn’t wish this upon my worst enemy, but I don’t even have any enemies.
I hope this puts things into perspective for you. To those who are also surviving schizophrenia, never give up! My voices keep threatening that they are going to force me to commit suicide, but I would NEVER do that. Don’t give up!! There is no reason to ever give in or give up. Peace. ✌️",schizophrenia
157,"It makes me question myself and everything around me. It created openmindness. You can tell who your friends are and who aren't. It gives you a unique perspective of life.
When I hear voices, some of them can be friendly and others harmful. For instance it's quite fun having conversations with my dog telepathically and with other animals. Other times I hear other voices that tell me to harm people or myself. Most of the time they put you down.
I question all the time whether what I'm seeing is real or just a hallucination. For instance is that just a shadow that I seen or is that a being from other dimension stalking me. Nope, it's just my usual demons stalking me.
I lost all my friends, but made new ones. They just think I'm really weird.
“I'm not crazy, it's the rest of the world.”",schizophrenia
158,"With the right treatment, people with schizophrenia can lead fulfilling lives. Some beneficial traits that may come with schizophrenia include: Higher IQ, Increased creativity, and Mathematical reasoning.
Other things that can help people with schizophrenia include:
Work: Many people with schizophrenia can work full or part time, especially if their condition is stable and they have support. Work can be a key part of recovery.
Social contacts: People with schizophrenia can benefit from social contacts to avoid loneliness and isolation. Caregivers can help loved ones maintain social skills by planning social activities and outings, helping them join community programs, or helping them keep in touch with friends.
Self-care: Doing things you enjoy, like cooking, listening to music, or doing DIY, can boost your confidence and help you stay well. Creative activities like drama, drawing, or sewing can help people express themselves and deal with difficult emotions.
Healthy lifestyle: Eating a balanced diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, avoiding too much stress, and having a regular sleep pattern can help reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease or diabetes.",schizophrenia
159,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
160,"Oh yes! Schizophrenia is all about becoming your own advocate. When we have been separated from our own perceptions by people telling us our perceptions lie about our feelings, our brain tries to fight back by giving us alert messages that we are in danger. This is for our benefit. We see what we see, which is trying to warn us of danger. Unfortunately, most people take these sounds and visions literally, which is a mistake. They are in the language of feelings, not the language of symbols.
But if you can interpret your psychoses effectively, you will learn what your brain thinks is putting you in danger. If you can figure out what to do about it, you can actually make your life safer and better. Unfortunately, both interpreting psychoses correctly and doing something about the danger are pretty difficult for most of us.
But at least you can feel like your voices or hallucinations or whatever other experiences you have are on your side, instead of seeing them as threats or dangerous. That can diminish your paranoia a lot. And if you can manage to do something, even something very small, to reduce the danger you are in, that can be significant. It can increase your sense that you can make a difference in your own life.
The experiences of schizophrenia are on your side, but it can be really hard to understand that because they look so negative to most people. Also, most people are in traps, and they can’t get out, so it feels hopeless to even be aware of the danger you are in when it seems like there’s no possibility to do anything about it. Many people would prefer to remain in denial of their danger.
But if you can accept that you are in danger, and that it is most likely the people around you who are causing that danger, then maybe you can learn to do small things to reduce the danger, instead of acting in ways that other people will say are “crazy.”",schizophrenia
161,"It’s mainly negative. But it’s made me more compassionate and caring, and more empathetic. I feel for the down trodden and non-conformists of society much more than before my diagnosis. Homeless people, disabled people, poor people, minorities, bullied people, victims of abuse, LGBTI, and so on. I often look upon people with much more humility and realise everybody for the most part is just trying to do their best. However this is also a curse because I tend to overthink the situation. I care way too much about what people think of me, knowing full well they don’t put the same amount of emotional input and analysis into me as I do to them.
The reason I’m like this is because of my psychosis. I’ve graced the depths of hell, I’ve seen and experienced the worst things the human condition has to offer. When you literally think your living in hell for a period of psychosis and you go back to some sort of remission, the scars of the psychosis are still there. You never forget how bad existence can be. You never want another human to experience such a thing, and you feel other’s suffering tenfold because you know what true suffering is like. You don’t dismiss people who say they are struggling as weak or pitiful, you completely feel their pain. It’s quite powerful.
now if you’d ask me what are the negatives of having schizoaffective disorder, the list is endless. I try to accept that this is the way it is and all of the things taken away from me by my illness don’t matter anymore. Very hard to do but peace of mind is the ultimate goal. I’m thankful I still function relatively well compared to others with my illness or with schizophrenia, I suppose I’m lucky in a way.",schizophrenia
162,"In my experience the good things that came for having schizophrenia can very from person to person. From what I benefit was being able to be more compassionate towards other who have illness and things I don't quite understand. I understood better the true feelings of depression and anxiety that I never felt before. I learned to have more control of my emotions and reactions. I also live a very healthy life style due to having to be cautious of what I put in my body for it might worsen my symptoms. I know priorities my health and am more understanding with my self.

163,"I can list plenty of negative things: nasty and negative hallucinations, horrible nightmares, so many voices, delusions and more; but at the risk of sounding bitter- I’ve got nothing positive to say. It hasn’t enriched my life, it hasn’t made for any positive experience. It’s a wretched illness for me that seems to ruin everything it touches. About the only thing it’s done for me is given me more empathy for people with mental illnesses; but I was already raised to have a good deal of sympathy for mental illnesses anyway.
Update 8/2024 It’s been hell. Sometime after I wrote this I actually started to get relief from medication. I squeezed out about two more mostly good years.

164,"Perhaps no direct benefits for the individual, but schizophrenia appears to have been positively and persistently selected throughout the course of human evolution, and it is theorized that it could have something to do with our development as creative, thinking beings.
According to a 2007 press release[1] by the institution who led the research (University of Bath)...
""..the researchers analysed the molecular evolution of the 76 genes that have the strongest genetic association with the disorder.
They surveyed human polymorphisms – discrete changes in the human genome that vary between individuals – for very recent selective events within specific human populations.
They also compared genes between mammalian species to identify selection on primate lineages salient to the evolution of humans and the disorder.
The research identified evidence for positive selection on a variety of genes, including three genes that have the best functional or reproducible associations with the disorder: disrupted in schizophrenia (DISC1), dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1).""

The researchers felt that schizophrenia may be a by-product of our development in the areas of language, creativity and human cognition.

165,"One positive aspect of having what's considered schizophrenia is that a person gets to experience a seemingly supernatural reality in addition to the popularly accepted (limited) reality where people are typically believed to not experience things like hearing something other than themselves talking in the mind. As a result of me hearing something talking in my mind and experiencing other phenomena, such as disturbing visions in my mind, I have an otherworldly or imaginative view of the world, life and people. My experience of life is like something out of a sci-fi movie, a genre I've always been drawn to.
I experience “negative symptoms” of what's considered schizophrenia, in addition to what are popularly considered hallucinations and delusions. I feel sad often, forgetful at points, and a low motivation to do things like household chores. I also experience what are commonly considered tactile hallucinations, like something touching the back of my head or another part of my body. I consider all my “symptoms” to be the doing of an entity that I believe makes the disturbing visions, and talks in my mind, along with others occurring to talk in my mind, as well.
I think people who are supposedly mentally ill are experiencing something that will be explained someday as what would be considered supernatural phenomena in today's world. I think it will be discovered that an entity, which most people would not believe is possible to exist today, creates all maladies and disharmony in the world, including the symptoms of so called mental illness. I think the entity really controls and torments everyone but only some people surface as having any experience of it, and they are popularly considered to be mentally ill today. I also believe people are telepathic and only some people surface as experiencing something of it and it is often considered mental illness here (or is often considered a sham in the case of psychics).
I don't know why only some people would experience aspects of the torment, controlling and telepathy, but I have been figuring that it is because some people are more present somehow here in what I think is a false reality.
I think this world is some kind of dream, simulation, or story of what could be if people and things were something other than who and what they truly are. For example, in truth, people would be like what this world considers angels, I was told in my mind. I believe objects would be animate and conscious; animals would be able to talk and would be friends with people and each other further than they are in today's world.
I believe this reality largely defines experiences or ideas, such as mine, as symptoms of mental illness because such experiences and ideas threaten the existing reality of the world from continuing.
As I wrote this, it occurred to me that I didn't know a lot about what were considered symptoms of mental illness historically compared to today. The thought occurs to me that people may not have had the same kinds of experiences that I hear some about today.",schizophrenia
166,"Some benefits that's I have noticed from having schizophrenia would be my tolerance level in stressful situation has dramatically increased. I learned to live with constant criticism and not to get effect by it. When people panic I plan.
I have become extremely health conscious. I treat my schizophrenia with natural remedies and music. Lions mane mushroom is especially good, along with Tulsi tea.
I am constantly work on new ways to improve my memory and cognitive ability. I use mind exercises every day. I enjoy learning new language and skills.
I learned not to let what others says effect me if the argument is groundless. Finding a reason in why I stand for certain things and understanding the deeps of that conviction.

167,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
168,"I'm sorry Teresea, but I'm really offended by your answer. I'm not sure who you know with schizophrenia, since it's clear from your answer you don't have it yourself, but it is flat-out untrue that schizophrenics never have that ""moment of clarity."" Some who either are very severely affected or don't treat themselves properly live with a constant level of delusion/hallucination, it's true.

However, many people manage their schizophrenia quite well, and spend most of their time percieving the world like everyone else. The delusional periods are the exception, not a constant state, and when hallucinations occur you use mental checks to try to help keep yourself in control. Don't act like all schizophrenics are just floating around in some nonsense world oblivious to the fact that none of its real. It's an insult to the effort some people put in every day to keep themselves ""normal""",schizophrenia
169,"If schizophrenia is left untreated, individuals may experience a range of severe and debilitating consequences, including:
Worsening Symptoms: Positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) and negative symptoms (lack of motivation, social withdrawal) can become more intense and frequent.
Functional Decline: Individuals may struggle to maintain relationships, employment, and daily activities, leading to increased isolation and dependency.
Increased Risk of Comorbid Conditions: Untreated schizophrenia is often associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and other mental health issues.
Cognitive Decline: Cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and executive functioning may deteriorate, making it harder to manage everyday tasks.
Physical Health Issues: There can be an increased risk of physical health problems due to neglect of self-care, poor nutrition, and sedentary lifestyle.
Increased Risk of Suicide: Individuals with untreated schizophrenia have a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Legal and Social Consequences: Some may face legal issues due to behaviors associated with untreated symptoms, leading to further social alienation.
Long-Term Prognosis: The overall long-term outcomes may worsen, making recovery more difficult and reducing the effectiveness of future treatment options.
Early intervention and treatment, including medication and therapy, are crucial for managing schizophrenia and improving quality of life.",schizophrenia
170,"It depends, schizophrenia is one of those diagnosis that causes a lot of fear and anxiety, often more in the people around the person diagnosed than the person themselves. It’s another disorder that Hollywood has blamed all matter of extremely dramatic plots on!
There are many tracks that schizophrenia can take, i by no means want to minimize it. A complete lack of treatment can result in hallucinations, self harm, violent outbursts, paranoia or suicide. Talk therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy) is a good place to start to make sure about where someone is in their need for further treatment.
Often family or friends feel that excessive medication is required to silence any voices or delusions. A friend of mine revealed to me that he had schizophrenia, he had no outward problems. He heard Jesus talking to him. Jesus never told him to do anything bad, they just sat around, smoked pot together and talked about all sorts of stuff.
His symptoms were worsened when he started smoking pot, he started to skip school and that was when he got ‘caught’. He explained that he was too busy talking with Jesus to come to school.
It’s common for pot to make symptoms of schizophrenia worse. If it runs in your family, you probably want to avoid it… particularly for males, but for women too, especially if your around the age of 16–25, these years are dangerous. Smoking pot before you’re 25 can really increase your chances of a lot of mental health problems. Schizophrenia is a major one and onset is scary, especially for family.
So… don’t smoke pot (especially a lot of it), avoid binge drinking if possible as well. This guy who talked to Jesus, his mom was a nurse. She had him locked up in the mental hospital very quickly and on serious medication.
My friend was sad, he stopped drawing, playing music and Jesus went away. Now, he had not done anything bad that I ever saw except skipping school and smoking pot… regular teenager things that came with a major punishment for him. His mom ruled his life. He had zero free will and medication ruled him.
He tapered off his medication, Jesus came back and so did his creativity, he was fine last time I saw him. Maybe in another time he would have been called a prophet, now he’s called schizophrenic.
On the other side, another friend, he was diagnosed after becoming convinced that the water was poisoned by the local pulp mill. His mom took him in (again). He ended up in permanent care as a ward of his parents. He put on weight and drooled and couldn’t pick up his own fork. He used to be a straight A student and wanted to be in politics. Was this the best thing? I don’t know enough to say.
Finally, the predictable case, no treatment, the voices wouldn’t stop, she killed herself. She said she had to kill someone and that the devil had sent her to kill beautiful things.
This is why I don’t think medication is always the right path and talk therapy is important. Some people create beautiful things and other people are tormented. It’s not always the same.",schizophrenia
171,"3 years ago I ended up hospitalized for a few days with the diagnosis of a religious psychotic episode (I strongly believed that the End of the World was approaching and that I was giving birth to the antichrist.) Doctors tried all kinds of pills during that time. in the end I had become a zombie, I was no longer afraid, but the thoughts were still there as a painful memory because those thoughts seem so real that inside you fight to tell yourself that it's just a weakness, it's just a fall and that everything is fine . After being discharged from the hospital, I felt weaker and weaker from the medication... I was absolutely always asleep, I had no strength over my own body, I was like a human awake but not alive and useful. my emotions were diffuse, I didn't feel anything too strong, in fact, I started having problems with my heartbeats as side effects..I was getting terribly fat and the ""bad thoughts"" were still there. everything I was before had become a story.. my whole life had changed.. The family of course opposed when it came to stopping the treatment. Life made it so that I had a friend who suffered from a manic depressive episode who was literally addicted to pills... and it didn't seem like it would ever stop, it was just as bad and yet she was just as addicted to them. Then I dared, I dared something that doctors will not understand and no one who does not know what it's like to lose your mind.. when you find the strength to pray and hope that you will forget.. that your brain will forget the trauma when you alone impose it on yourself never get there again. 3 years have passed since then and I stopped the medication after the first month... it returned to who I knew I was before through work through time with me through prayers and through the desire to keep this wonderfulness of normal mind. I'm still fighting because it's like a scar for life because it's a terrible feeling to see yourself disappearing, but for me personally, if I didn't stop taking the pills, I think I wouldn't have the strength to go on and be able to help myself!",schizophrenia
172,"It is one of those illnesses which is more likely to deteriorate than resolve on its own, if left unaddressed.
Schizophrenia can be terrifying, if the hallucinations and delusions, which are a part of the disorder engulf you and are driving your life.
It becomes truly a matter of great concern when the afflicted person, under the influence of these perceptual and thought disturbances,when he loses touch with reality, he becomes a threat to himself and the society.
Also Schizophrenia needs treatment, since in most cases the social withdrawal is extreme and patient stops taking care of activities of daily hygiene.
However, many Schizophrenics can be taught and can learn to live with their hallucinations and their delusions, when the have a good understanding of the nature of illness and understand the reality and unreality of a thing, situation, and person.
John Nash(the movie ‘A Beautiful Mind’ depicts his real life story) is a good example.
In my practice I'm trying to wean some of actively Schizophrenic patients off medication, who have reached to an understanding of the illness, and learned how to deal with it.
I however needed the help of medication at the outset, to gain control of the situation and stabilise them.",schizophrenia
173,"Since taking medications not only did nothing to hinder the voices, but also had the added “bonus” of lovely side effects, life is pretty damn good for an unmedicated schizophrenic like me.
Medicated or unmedicated, life is exactly the same. I’ve met VERY few voice hearers who claim their voices 100% stop upon taking medication. In fact I’ve only met one person who says that.
Most others say it helps but only to a certain degree.
Then of course there’s the others who, like me, get zero benefit from anti-psychotic medications and seek relief through other means.
The Hearing Voices Network [ https://www.hearingvoicesusa.org/ ] has been very helpful in introducing me to other voice hearers who cope and live their lives bo...

174,"What happens if schizophrenia is left untreated?
It all depends on the length of time the person with schizophrenia goes without treatment and the severity of his/her illness.
For the mild form of schizophrenia, the patient do get better with less medications. I know of some of my patients who was able to function normally under this category.
For the more severe form of schizophrenia, dosing of medications may increase over time and are often mandatory for their life time.
Those schizophrenic patients who have defaulted on their medications do get worst over time, meaning their symptoms becoming more acute and they do lost touch with reality.
So it is imperative for the patient to take his/ her medications on a regular basis as well as to work closely with his/ her assigned healthcare team in order to bring the disease under control.
When schizophrenia patients who defaulted on treatment for a long period of time , their conditions relapses as in the symptoms appears, and this can turn into a chronic state which makes the treatment challenging.
Suicide, suicide ideation, aggression, OCD, drug abuse, lifetime unemployment, etc are some of the complications of long standing untreated schizophrenia.

175,"It has an immense effect on your life. Depending on the intensity of it even a somewhat moderate level can make you dysfunctional is some aspects of your life. Schizophrenia is one of the very dangerous mental disorders and should not be left untreated for the person to be bale to lead a normal life.
People who are off their medication usually have relapses. The longer you are out of treatment, the worse it can get. A person might not be able to get married, hold a job, raise a family and in some cases people do go missing and homeless. (Often running away from their home).
For the person suffering with this disorder it is difficult to understand that they are infact suffering from an illness and hence, they refuse to take treatment. If you know someone with this disorder, you should try your best to get them into a treatment program.",schizophrenia
176,"There are hallucinations and they are quite damaging for your personal health and your life.
My condition of schizophrenia was discovered when i was working in a private company and i was living under hell i can tell you as much.
My medical condition was already bad before i joined the organisation to be precise it was somewhere between my 11th and 12th that i was suffering from schizophrenia.
My first hallucination was that my mother was a bad woman and she was against me. My all hallucinations came to end when recently i was diagnosed and then treated for schizophrenia.
My second hallucination was about a girl that i thought was in love with me when we were in college. She was beautiful and i couldn't resist myself falling in love with her. But now when i look back i realize that my love was one sided and she didn't liked me.
During college my brain build an intricate level of web of details which were not there actually that i was thinking she committed suicide for me. I even wrote her name with a blade on my hand thinking that she committed suicide for me.
This girl remained in my head for the 7 years time when finally i lost my job because of her thought.
My third hallucination was in my company in which i was placed via campus selection along with my freind. Among them was another beautiful girl for whom again i thought that she was commiting suicide for me. In fact she was also very nice and was not intrested in me.
I use to think that during my college my freind were the main reason why i and that girl cannot meet so i use to hold grudges against my freind in secret. During one event i and my room mate had a fight over this new girl in my company and i was sent home for psychiatric treatment as i showed him knife.
Schizophrenia can make you dangerous.
There i met my doctor for the first time and he diagnosed me correctly after my parents told them everything.
Thinghs went normal for some days and then after 7 months my problem came back again. I again started believing that the girl of my company loved me and she even came to my hostel and this was the disaster that cost me my high paying job.
Evantually i started thinking that she had affair with my companies owner and that she was a slut which was utter bullshit. I started believing that everyone was watching me and that my phone is being hacked and i am under some sort of surveillance.
I believed that everyone was spitting and coughing on me and that police was after me. After some time out of frustration i left my job and now i am jobless and left with no friends.
My treatment is underway. My medicines are Ariperen 5 mg and Sulputac 200 mg with 400mg dose for me per day.
Thank you for reading….",schizophrenia
177,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.
Source: Schizophrenic, currently off my meds (I should be on meds, I will decide based on my symptoms) and working a nice high paying job. I intend to write a book about my experiences and monetize it. I have what is called “awareness” I know that I am sick. Many schizos are not as lucky as I am. The “paranoid” type of schizo, seems to leave mental reasoning and faculties intact. I still have my radio detection device, my brass helmet (to guard against radio waves etc.) and other countermeasures. At the time it all made perfect sense. How am I dealing with it? Well I have a schizo friend who says there is no upside to it, everything is terrible. I disagree. If and when I choose to make my illness public, I will have the ultimate excuse. And I have an excuse to be lazy, to not shower, to not cut my nails. It’s fucking great. I am taking ownership of my schizo, and will probably publish a book about it. By the way, delusions of grandeur is another symptom of schizophrenia.
Take care and good luck… one of the main ways people “recover” from schizophrenia is to help others. Problem is not everyone is the helping type, and not everyone needs help. I will see who I can help in this life, but first I have to look after myself. And make the most out of the time I have, because life expectancy of a schizo is 15 years less.",schizophrenia
178,"It may be that the patient recovers.
Let me try to explain my perspective as a patient of psychiatry who has a longtime diagnosis of schizophrenia.
In my opinion it's that which causes the psychosis which is that what needs attention. Not the psychosis per se. Merely treating the superficial symptoms of serious underlying health problems is ultimately likely fatal. Probably.
It's more valuable to the health of the patient that he be fed, housed and get proper rest. Once that has been addressed, then one might begin to search for other specific issues that may be more specific to the condition proper.
A person may recover from psychosis with time, no psychiatric pharmaceutical need be used. Possibly one may need to be rested also.",schizophrenia
179,"That word you are using was invented by Eugene Bluelor in 1912, to replace dementia praecox. In more than 100 years of it’s use, there have been 100 variations, added, or subtracted from the official literature. In all of that time there has never been any X-Ray, Blood Test, Fecal Screen, or any other test from the lab. to prove who does, or who does not have “it”. The troubled, confused, and conflicted have always been among us. Some are now using the more blanket expression “psychotic disorders”, finally having realized this detail. Anti-psychotic medication, which in the past acted much like a chemical straight jacket, typically had pronounced side effects, called extra-pyramidal. And side effects to pills are the number #1 reason why people go off their medication. They never really “Fixed” the problem, as such, and many claimed that the “cure was worse than the disease”. Out patient Programs tried to teach folks how to blend in, and “Act Normal”.

Yes.

180,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.

After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.

182,"I think so, because it is a fact that they do. We can find them all around us.
Though the bare and simple fact is that plenty of people do great without drug use, and many more could do well if they were given a proper chance, there are three main concerns to address in providing context for any answer to your question:
1. Firstly, whatever gets called “schizophrenia” is not just one kind of experience. Many different kinds of experiences with differing underlying causes and dynamics get labeled as “schizophrenia”. Not everyone shares the same difficulties or same options for life stability or successful forward progress. It is basically nonsensical to consider everyone with a specific psychiatric diagnosis, such as “schizophrenia”, to be in the same boat and having the same limitations (or same opportunities, for that matter).
The diagnosis “schizophrenia” actually tells us nothing about what someone’s concerns are, what their needs are, and how best to support rehabilitation or a sustainable meeting of personal goals. Psychiatric diagnoses don’t contain that kind of information, nor do they explain why experiences are happening in the first place. There is no intrinsic connection between “schizophrenia” and drug use except what you hear in marketing — the marketing is the creation of the connection, not an evidence-based assessment.
2. Secondly, “living” is a low bar. A better focus here would be quality of life, and things like longevity, functionality, health, and self-actualization. If drug use or non-use merely keeps someone alive, we are totally missing the point. I suspect your question was probably meaning ‘living, probably independently and with a decent level of social functioning and an average or above average quality of life’. That sort of goal is entirely reasonable for most people given a “schizophrenia” diagnosis who decide not to use drugs. However, making it happen can take a lot of work and learning.
An important factor here is also how we address difficulties that perhaps do not fully resolve with therapeutic strategies or other rehabilitation. Many people can experience a full resolution, but for those that don’t, how someone learns to work with particular ways of experiencing can depend on very personal things, from personality and life situation to preferences regarding lifestyle and philosophical values. Not everyone feels the same way about particular experiences, challenges, or trade-offs, so what one individual feels is a good life or an appreciable compromise may seem untenable to another.
3. Thirdly, “without medication” comes in degrees. Some people do great by avoiding drugs from the very start, others prefer to sometimes use drugs during states of acute crisis but not engage in lifestyle drugging, meaning they might use drugs once or twice in their lives, or sometimes even more often. A third group is people who were put on drugs and then decided to go off them, whether because the drugs were not very helpful, or too harmful, or because they were never appropriate in the first place, or because someone felt able to do well without them — especially if they had learned new strategies or adopted new perspectives since when they were first put on drugs.
So, even if anyone in these three groups will usually be ‘drug free’ in their everyday life, not all of these people will necessarily have no history of drug use or no potential future drug use. How you count such cases into the idea of “living without medication” is up to your own standards for what should or shouldn’t qualify. You didn’t mention any particular cutoff, but studies looking at drug use and non-use typically look at how many months have passed since the last instance of drug use. That does not provide all the insight we’d want, but is better than no sort of tracking at all.
Taken together, this all means that what matters is the individual and their experiences and goals and priorities, not their diagnosis. Having the tools, support, and will to make progress is often key to drug-free recovery, as is personal tailoring of any service usage. Of course, ‘recovery’ isn’t always an appropriate word, and some people can stabilize and go on in life untroubled even if they don’t take any specific ‘interventive’ steps. The concept of “schizophrenia” tends to do a lot more harm than good, because people are told it means they are hopeless to ever be ‘cured’ and helpless to ever be happy or functional without lifelong drugging with dangerous neurotoxins.
The average patient faces at least as much to overcome in the insidious psychiatric paradigm as they do in their own difficult and confusing experiences. This also brings up an additional caveat for context, which is that psychiatry can say anything they want about “schizophrenia” regardless of what people actually experience. If they want to say someone is “sick” or that drugs are always required, there is no objective support for those ideas so there can be no objective rejection of them. They are merely dogma in service of industry, and no amount of success without drugging can disprove statements of faith.
I suggest reading research showing superb results with non-drug interventions and talking to people who have experienced non-drug successes. You can even find a lot of information, first-hand accounts, and resources in some Quora threads, such as this one: Can a schizophrenic recover without medication?",schizophrenia
183,"It depends on the etiology of the psychosis, or in other words- how it came about.
Psychosis can be substance or drug induced. Abuse or use of a specific substance can lead to psychosis in both the intoxicated phase and if dependence or tolerance has developed, sometimes in the withdrawal phase. In this case, cessation of use could possibly eliminate the psychosis as well as successfully withdrawing completely from the abused substance.
Additionally, sometimes medication interactions or side effects from a prescribed medication can induce psychosis. Again the psychosis could subside and go away if the medication is no longer taken.
There can be medical causes for psychosis as well. A head injury, brain lesions, brain cysts or tumors could cause psychosis. These situations typically don't get better without medical intervention of one form or another although it is possible that the condition could stabilize (i.e. A brain tumor stops growing or affecting other brain areas.)
Psychosis can be a transient dissociative type state resulting from a disorder such as PTSD. A person who has experienced severe trauma may become triggered by various environmental stimuli, exacerbating stress and leading to a psychotic state. Sometimes these states rectify themselves on their own, only to return under periods of extreme stress. These individuals usually seek treatment for other symptoms and the psychosis gets treated secondarily.
Psychosis can also be a symptom of a severe mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder or severe depression. These situations tend to worsen over time without treatment. Typically lifelong treatment is needed to manage psycjotic symptoms when evidenced in these disorders. Getting treatment early in the development of the disorder can be a factor in decreasing progressive severity of symptoms of psychosis. stopping or frequently interrupting treatment can also be a factor in increasing the severity off the psychosis as by and large, the functioning of individuals with psychosis seems to decline after reconstitution after each psychotic episode.
Its important to seek professional assistance to determine the etiology of your psychosis to determine a course of treatment- if necessary at all. In my opinion, it is not something that should be ignored as it does tend to worsen over time without professional intervention.",schizophrenia

If I stop taking the meds I’d probably start hallucinating again.
Untreated schizophrenia can be dangerous if the person who has it hears voices commanding them to hurt themselves or others. Luckily this didn’t happen to me - for the most part the voices called me all sorts of names and wouldn’t leave me alone, that is until I got on meds that worked.

190,"I can answer this based on experience. First, how old is your brother, I'm guessing in late teens to older twenties. Usually it gets diagnosed around 16 to 18. My brother was 17 when he had a breakdown at work. He had signs from a young age at mental illness, very moody, anxiety, extreme outbursts.. but my parents wouldn't believe it, they saw mental illnesses as some failing on their part, would never take him to psychiatrist. Fast forward, my dad is gone, my mom dies, only me and my sister are left to care for my brother, I'm 22 at the time she is 20, he is 19. We both work full time, he gets social security after a 2 year battle. The next 10 years, this is my example, I can't say if it will be the same for you, were a complete nightmare. The doctors, nothing against them they do their best many are very caring and this is hard, kept diagnosing him with various mental illness. New medication, New treatment, random break downs, hospital stays, institutions, back home, repeat. FOR TEN YEARS. At my expense and his welfare. My sister helped as she could but eventually had her own family. So, after all this I am 33, My brother is 30, he is on medication, in a mental health facility similar to a nursing home, going to college, on social security, eventually will move to an assisted living apartment, I still help support him. This is as good as it can be for him and I. He has trouble everyday with things that I can't even really understand. At the same time, while I want to help all I can, there are limitations. He does much better in a supervised, regimented, organized, social, environment. In all the years living at home with me, regular life was too much, he couldn't keep track of medication, doctor visits, personal hygiene, cleaning up after himself, trying to go to school. It wore us both out. Finally, in the setting he is now we are both much happier, and he is more like himself.

191,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”.

The thing tho with schizophrenia is the enemy/ problem their facing is spiritual and although it’s a very real thing, most people will not be able to hear/ see the things “schizophrenics” do is because they 1: don’t want you to hear/ see them and 2: they don’t have legal access to be able to target you like they do with “schizophrenics”
with “schizophrenics” and with most of the cases, theirs legal rights and an access point that they unknowingly and unintentionally gave to the spirits/ demons that now inhabit ( partially possess their temple/ body and mind. For example and one of the things that will almost always connect someone’s to the spiritual side where spirits reside at in a dimension we can’t see is thru drug consumption. Drugs/ “medications” are an open portal/ gateway opening up the spirit realm and once you consume them and break that spiritual law, those demonic spirits in that realm can now pass thru the door you opened up and thru the legal rights you gave them, take over/ inhabit your temple which your spirit resides. As humans our soul/ spirit is possessing/ controlling our bodies and we can speak and move etc. with what’s known as demonic possession ( which is usually just demonic influence ) demons who have invaded and given access to dwell inside our body/ mind can start to speak not just inside our mind and implant voices/ delusions, but even in more severe/ rare cases speak out of the person ( usually in what’s know...

194,"It is most definitely real, and one of the most researched of all mental illness.
I have been a hospital patient several times due to mental illness. Specifically due to major depression and panic disorder. I met quite a few folks suffering from schizophrenia. It is nothing like you see in the movies. These people were not violent or doing overly bizarre things. There was one friend I had in hospital named Pete who had active schizophrenia. The only obvious sign was when you spoke with him. His speech structure was all over the place and incoherent as to what he was trying to say.
I’ve since known many people who are managing their schizophrenia. You would not know they had the disorder unless they told you. They function well, and with a huge amount of courage.",schizophrenia
195,"Schizophrenia is a real illness. The voices, paranoid and other symptoms it causes for the sufferer are internally generated due to an organic issue of the brain that is still not fully understood. The treatment of this ‘real’ illness is antipsychotic medication and is likely not addressing the root issue, but rather is indirectly solving only part of the problem. Psychiatrists know it’s a real issue because it shows up and manifests itself in document-able and somewhat predictable ways among all types of people (every gender, race, etc.).
I have schizophrenia and even so I have asked this question many times because I couldn’t believe that my brain could distort reality and have such a devastating effect on my daily life. I think the only people who have any understanding of how real this illness is and how deeply it disrupts the sufferer are people very close to the person, the sufferer themselves, doctors/psychiatrists, and psych unit nurses.",schizophrenia
196,"Yes. I support and work with people almost everyday with people who have the diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I see everyday, the people that I support engaging in self talk, and responding to things that I and others do not see.
Often, they aren’t too bothered by their hallucinations, some actually are nearly always chatting like friends do when catching up, laughing etc.
But on the flip side, I have seen first hand someone use a razor to cut their throat because they couldn’t cope with their voices. I’ve also seen someone talk in many different voices, because she has so many voices that she engages with.
Medication can help, it never takes away the hallucinations completely. It does however keep them out of hospital, for the most part. Sometimes, they will need to go back to hospital for a medication review, or to be treated by medical professionals.
So yes, Schizophrenia is definitely an illness",schizophrenia
197,"As a mother of a son who has had schizophrenia from twenty two till now when he is near fifty, I can tell you he is still the most loving and sweet child I had. He was born three months premature back when they didn’t know how to keep babies alive.Before I gave birth I was bleeding to death and they could not find his heart beat for over an hour. Two pounds four oz. dropped down to a pound and fourteen oz. He was very ill much of the time and needed surgery.
I don’t know how many of you have had to deal with loving someone that was having such a hard time just living, but he remained the sweetest person I have known.He managed to grow up into a good looking and kind person, and then schizophrenia hit. This disorder took away so much that my son had gained in his hard life.
My son Michael has to live in a special environment for people who have special needs. He is one of them now. He can no longer hold down a job or manage a real relationship with a woman.He lives in a constant state of worry.He becomes afraid very easy. I have mentioned before that at times he may talk to me and then other times he blames me for the way he is. So when he remembers that he loves me, I am on cloud nine, for a long as it last.

I question my body and wether what I feel is real or just my mind using my body to play tricks on me. I wonder why? why about everything. ………..I don't want to go into another sychosis for me they last too long and before I know it I'm in another town miles away from my support group with no shoes and don't have any idea where I am going or what brought about to make me go. this terrifies me. and yet I can't help but feel that being in untreated sychosis for a while I don't know if it opened a part of my brain or what chemicals were released but since my hallucinations started I believe I have become smarter. and my curiosity to learn has jumped from non existent to learning is all I want to do. the reality is like with every thing in life when it shits on you and you take it the best you can. when the dust settles, you can see some good in it.",schizophrenia

I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it.

202,"🌟 Is Schizophrenia Real? Understanding the Truth Behind the Mystery 🌟
Yes, schizophrenia is absolutely real. Its a complex, scientifically recognized mental health condition that affects how people perceive reality, think and behave. This condition is not a myth or a label—its a neurological and psychological disorder backed by decades of research.
👉 What is Schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder characterized by symptoms like:
Hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that aren’t there).
Delusions (strong beliefs that don’t align with reality).
Disorganized Thinking (difficulty concentrating or communicating clearly).
Emotional Withdrawal (loss of interest in life or social connections).
💡 The Science Speaks!
Brain imaging and genetic studies show that schizophrenia has biological underpinnings, often influenced by a combination of genetics, environment and brain chemistry. Its not a choice or weakness but a medical condition that requires understanding and support.
✨ Why Awareness Matters
Misconceptions about schizophrenia often lead to stigma, making it harder for those affected to seek help. By understanding the condition, we can create a world where compassion replaces judgment.
💬 Lets Talk About It!
If you or someone you know is struggling, reach out to a mental health professional. Together, we can build a supportive community where mental health is prioritized.
🌈 Remember: Mental health matters and knowledge is the first step to breaking the stigma! Share this to spread awareness. 💕",schizophrenia
203,"I’ve studied my own schizoaffective for ten years now. I’m honestly baffled that western medicine continues to refer to it as a chemical imbalance or brain structure malfunction when it’s clearly so far beyond that.
Schizophrenia encompasses many facets of consciousness. To understand it, you must keep an open mind to the possibility of life beyond the flesh, quantum mechanics, metaphysics, spirituality, beliefs (cultural, ethnic, religious) the un, sub, and conscious mind, even philosophy.
My experience came to me via a search for spiritual answers. I had a full kundalini awakening and began practicing listening for my “spirit guides.” It turned ugly for me as I was unprepared for the energies I had awoken. My visions became intense. Visions of past lives, loved ones on the other side, my uncles untimely death experience, thought projections, and more. This was actually more of “spiritual crisis” as it’s called in some circles rather than schizophrenia. As it caused me great distress and I was not ready to “wake up” so to speak.
However, it has given me great insight to the root problem of schizophrenia which is similar in many ways without necessarily the interest in spiritual matters. The energies that I had woken up to were not all bad. Much of these messages I received were from loving guides but at the end of the day, the more I thought about it, most of the voices and visions pertained to my own thought processes, subconscious or conscious, beliefs, fears, or perceptions.
There were also many experiences of clairvoyance such as loved ones of others coming through and one warning of a dear friend who was found to have killed himself the next day.
My point is that schizophrenia is far more that a brain malfunction or a chemical imbalance. There is energy all around us that can either be harmful, or helpful. When one’s thought processes become compromised it can leave them susceptible to mental illness. But it does not mean they are necessarily broken. One’s mind is powerful. There are loving energies out there as well. Harnessing inner strength and a belief in oneself will lead one out of the darkness of schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
204,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
205,"As a Schizophrenic and a Psychology student I can assure you that yes, Schizophrenia is a real disease.
Unfortunaly, this disease is still unknowed at its core in the actuality, being highly misanderstood and proportionaly having less variability of treatment.
When we talk about Schizophrenia, we talk about a reality disruption that affects our cognitive capacity of racional thinking. In your mind, the unreality you think its real can be recognized by anyone, except you. Anyone that hear what you say when in crisis Will think exactly the same: “thats not possible”.
When i was in crisis, i thought that things i heard on television was about me, or for me.
I thought that famous persons were talking for me, trying to help me.
Thats ocasionaly named Persecutory Delusion.
Another types of Delusions can be found in Schizophrenic people, such as somatic delusion and the delusion of greatness.

206,"Schizophrenia is real. A woman I loved very dearly had it and we tried and tried to treat it or to work around it I guess but there is no working around it. She was the sweetest woman you ever want to know and We were married She was like 25 but starting about 26 years old, the shit kicked in. I'd be falling asleep She said I'm going to wait till you fall asleep and stick an ice pick through your ear. So I have this great woman and married her because I loved her So much and I thought I finally hit the jackpot. There's no doubt about it. Then she starts asking me why I killed her old boyfriend cuz her old boyfriend's in the ceiling telling her I killed him. She was drinking too. That made it worse. She destroyed my room When is it work about six different times. She threatened to burn down the house, again when she was drunk. Her drinking made it worse but it also quieted the voices. I couldn't take anymore after 5 years of trying and hoping and often times I'm like she's back to normal but then boom, she's gone. I had her move to North Carolina. She finally stopped drinking and got off any drugs and stuff and she was doing it really great but the schizophrenia was worse than ever. She couldn't help it. But it was torture from what I understand now. The voices were so loud she couldn't hear anybody over them sometimes. She recently passed away but then came through a psychic and this was definitely her just after her death. And there was no like is there or I feel a pain in my shoulder or that type of fake stuff.. This was just her putting it out there uninterrupted and it was all accurate. She said the arguments and the voices were so loud she couldn't even pay attention to what people were saying and couldn't be herself. I was the only one that really knew her. I really loved her, I really did. She quit drinking quit everything and she was on track So I can finally bring her back here and make a life but when you stop drinking the voices get louder because you're not able to drown them out. She said she had a stomach ache And I was begging her to go to the doctor. I sent safety checks over to check on her everyday for 3 days and the fourth day she couldn't say she didn't want treatment and they took her an ambulance finally. 3 days of safety checks and then she couldn't say no to the hospital the fourth day and they took her by ambulance and she died that night. They don't know what the cause of death was but I kind of think now it’s cuz she quit drinking. The reason I write this is because you have to get it treated, it won't go away. The only thing I have heard that will temporarily cure it or make it a little better are shock treatments. And you have to do it about every month from what I understand. She didn't go to a hospital cuz she thought she was immortal And whatever she had must have been just been food poisoning/. If you are conscious enough to say no, they can't treat you that's the end of that. Schizophrenia is real. And don't underestimate it it doesn't get better, it gets worse. I just lost the love of my life and there was no avoiding it. I've realized that. If you don't want to lose whoever you care about it has the stuff, I think shock treatments are the only thing that works or inVega but that doesn't really help. The point is don't underestimate this shit It is tragic and it is something you Just have to endure if you love the person and don't let them any excuse to stop being treated because it doesn't go away. If you read this message, understand it has to be addressed and it has to be treated and it has to be a lifetime commitment. I wish you all the luck and I hope my experience can help you find your through this maze but don't understand it and the person that has it, it's not their fault. Shock therapy is the only thing I have ever heard that works. And there's my two cents worth I hope it helps.",schizophrenia
207,"I've wondered about the so-called “organic” reasons that people have the symptoms of Schizophrenia. Certainly, they are much more serious than my symptoms created by my “Anxiety Neurosis!” Yet, if Big Pharma had their way, they would blame Anxiety on an inner group of cells, neurons, or whatever misfiring.
Yet, through years and years of self observation and self analysis (psychoanalytic style), I was able to source the origins of my nonfunctional life. Yes, through many years, I had debilitating depression and felt suicidal - all the while knowing that I would not “off” myself. I always had a sense of self, even in early childhood. Not a fully formed sense of self, just a vague awareness that someone was in there, so I did not feel fully abandoned.
Perhaps it would have been easier to reach out for help if I truly felt alone. We are all so very different, unique. This is the reason that I feel all humans can not be treated under one treatment style. All treatment modalities may serve to improve certain conditions, but I only found one modality that could be of use to me. However, it was up to me to find my own cure.
I'm really getting off track here. Because of my personal story. I wonder if new avenues are being explored to gain better insight into Schizophrenia. I have a nephew struggling with Schizophrenia. I would love to explore treatment for him using certain drugs that could break down the walls of mental illness.
Knowing some of his parental family history and his early childhood experiences could be helpful to the process that I have run a thought experiment on.
These people need help that they are not getting. What can I do, call u
p the California Hospital where he lives, and offer my help in his treatment if they can accommodate my Thought Experiment? Right, how likely would they jump at such an offer! They'd probably institutionalize me. LOL, Kidding, of course.
Well, I'm here, ready for service.
No one has reached out to me. Therefore, I will continue to blather away, sharing my thoughts and ideas.
No, there is another thread on Schizophrenia where I will share these thoughts. I've already vented my frustrations there, so that's where I'll share and add to what I've already started. If you want to know more about Schizophrenia look for it. If not, have a wonderful day.",schizophrenia
208,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
209,"Yes it do. But its just a term made by doctors to describe the mental state of a person for whom a different kind of reality is created by his mind. But who knows, maybe the reality created by the mind of schizophrenic person is actually real and the one we see is false.

As someone diagnosed with ‘ schizophrenia ' I have read countless medical studies in regards to schizophrenia and none of them are able to provide irrefutable evidence of what schizophrenia is or caused by. Some studies make statements that at best indicate or suggest there are correlations between the symptoms of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and brain dysfunction or brain “ abnormalities"". When reading articles about schizophrenia , always check the sources , when it comes to “ studies"" always check the conditions of the studies conducted etc.
Correlation does not equal causations.
The fact is that it is still unknown what schizophrenia is or what is is caused by. What some studies “ suggest"" or even “ strongly suggest “is not evidence.
As a side note, not everyone “suffers"" from “schizophrenia”( between quotations, because it is not agreed upon what is is and ultimately it's just a name/ label given to a huge range/variety of traits that occur in different combinations/ ratios). I don't ‘suffer' from “ schizophrenia"" and some others I personally know don't, but we do suffer how we are treated by others due to a highly stigmatized and misunderstood label slapped onto us.

215,"Make an appointment with your Primary Care Provider and have a complete physical examination including blood work, EKG, thyroid level etc. Talk to your doctor about why you feel you have schizophrenia, specifically about any new or odd thinking or experiences you may be having. Usually it is diagnosed in the late teens or early twenties and there is a genetic component. Someone in your immediate family or extended family may have a psychotic illness. Your doctor ( PCP) will make you a referral to see a Mental Health Provider.
Attend the appointment made with the Mental Health Professional. They will want to spend at least 1 hour with you the first time. Bring to the appointment any medications you have been taking, even over the counter. Be truthful about alcohol and drug use, especially cannabis. THC is one of the most harmful triggers for psychosis in a brain under 25 years old. Know your medical history and as much family medical history as you can find out.
Follow the psychiatrist orders. If he or she prescribes medication take it exactly as ordered. Give yourself a break from any stressful situations you have going on. Stress makes symptoms worse so your job is to maintain as much of a stress free lifestyle as possible. Take one day at a time. Eat nutritious protein packed food, veggies and fruits.
Exercise at least 3 times per week by getting outside. Maintain a good sleep schedule. Go to bed and get up at the same time. If you have to take an hour nap in the afternoon that is fine.
Surround yourself with a good support system who understand how important it is you lead a healthy life. Please consider a counselor or therapist to be part of your support team. Contact NAMI which is a world wide organization to support illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression. They have extensive resources.
Use dim lighting, do not listen to loud harsh violent music or read any books such as those. Play cards, put puzzles together, read books that you enjoy, journal your thoughts, keep interested in pleasant experiences.

I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
217,"I tried a lot of stuff to make the hallucinations go away. I tried some of the spiritual (excorisms and spells) and then I tried medication as well. The spiritual didnt do anything noticable for my psychosis. The medication lessened the hallucinations but only a little and they caused terrible side effects so I got off. The only thing that really helped with my psychotic symtoms, was time and experience. When everything was new and I just started hearing the voices or seeing the shadows I thought they were evil spirits. I thought they had power. This terrified me honestly. Even just the thought of being watched by them paranoid me. But eventually after living with them for over two years now, I've grown used to it for the most part. Sometimes I still get paranoid a bit, but that's only when I start to see them flying around in the corner of my eyes cause I think they might be bugs or I think they might jump out from behind me (even if I know they arent real that's still freaky). But when they talk, or when I just see them standing there (the shadow people) I dont get paranoid anymore because I know they arent real and can't hurt me. I'm used to it for the most part.
That said, there are little things I do to lessen the hallucinations. I make sure I get tons of sleep (cause they get worse with too little sleep) and I make sure I decrease my stress levels with meditation and exercise. I also stay away from situations in which I know I'd get stressed or I'd trigger my psychosis. With the negative symtoms such as lack of energy or lack of motivation, medication has helped tremendously with that. Stimulants specifically.",schizophrenia
218,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
219,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia
220,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
221,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
222,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
223,Hi I am diagnosed with skizophrenia and generalised anxiety disorder I was on olanzapine antipsychotic medication that was too sedating so switched to risperidone that messed up all my body liver made me diabetic type 2 high triglycerides in my blood abd didn't fully get rid of the voices I'm now on aripiprazole 20mg daily it helps me to focus more and my moods are better idont get as many nasty thoughts or violent and anger.but the voices remain never gone away but I find my opioid medsfor pain arthritis dull out the voices daily to just a murmur I suppose everyone is different and antipsychotic meds may be the answer to them.good luck hope this helps,schizophrenia
224,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
225,"I have managed to do better with my mental health in recent years because I embrace the fact that I have mental health problems. By being willing to admit this, I have been able to take advantage of mental health services in the form of medication and therapy.
Seroquel helps me relax in the evening and eases anxiety and paranoia
Risperdal helps with delusions and paranoia
Vyvanse helps with my ADHD and helps me with the negative symptoms of schizophrenic-like illness such as not wanting to do anything. Vyvanse has been important in helping me experience life and it helps reduce the anhedonia and akathisia side effects of the risperdal, but not all schizophrenics can take Vyvanse as it can increase psychosis.
Whenever I am feeling off, I will just take refuge by searching online about schizophrenia to help remind myself that alot of how I feel is just in my head. I don’t actually have a diagnosis of schizophrenia but I have had a lot of symptoms of it over the years, and some people have told me they think I might have schizophrenia or schizoeffective, including a psychiatrist.",schizophrenia
226,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.

227,"Observing and understanding the phenomena of hearing voices, paranoia, tactile sensation, delusional beliefs, images playing on the mind etc for 4 years, making notes, etc and seeing it clearly as demonic interference. It’s too obvious in my case. I am 48. I have practised Vipassana meditation for more than 15 years so observing mind and mental content comes easily to me. Demons or demonic beings (I can’t see them but can feel their presence in my space clearly and hear them talk to me) have access to our thoughts and feelings and can play with our memory. I am able to explain most of the stuff that happens within my space. I don’t identify with the voices or the intrusive thoughts or the beliefs etc and know them clearly as demonic play. That doesn’t help with my physical suffering but mentally I do pretty ok. Another thing that helps me is the insight I have developed through Vipassana meditation that helps in staying detached with our sensory selves, thoughts and feelings. Drugs did not help me at all.

228,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time. It started to take a toll on my health. I lost a lot of weight. I was contently dying. I got thrown out of most of the motels in town, and was running out of places to go.

229,"I was accepted into a service specifically for people going through psychosis. I have a support worker who comes every couple of weeks to do DBT with me she also helps me with medication, comes with me to social groups for schizophrenics and getting my disability benefits then when I’m ready she’ll help me find a job through the service that will have accommodations for me so I don’t get overwhelmed and stressed. That made a massive difference for me it helps that we get along well and I trust her. Then day to day I make sure I stick to my routine I take my medication do things like garden, paint, baking, cooking, knitting and crochet. I’ve made a lot of progress doing this but the thing is you HAVE to do it every day a couple times I’ve broken my routine and it sent me backwards. I think im pretty stable I still hallucinate and have pretty bad anxiety but I can go on walks alone now which is huge because before this I hadn’t gone outside in 2 years.

230,"In understanding what is schizophrenia, Dr Eric Berne’s book Transactional analysis in psychotherapy is very useful. The book starts with the case study of Mrs Primus whose interview with Berne results in diagnosis of schizophrenia. Many case studies are given like Mr Troy , Mr Dix suffering from schizophrenia. The entire mental energy of patients with schizophrenia is taken away by the Parental Ego state leaving the patient to sleep a lot in which condition alone the Child ego state has autonomy to replenish its mental energy by free floating . In the waking state the patient desperately resorts to Overinclusion of innocent bystanders sucking them of their mental energy . When they are alone with no scope for Overinclusion they sexcite themselves with daydreaming and resort to masturbation with the ostensible purpose of converting the last drop of physiological semen energy into mental energy of excitement , only to surrender it at the altar of Parental Ego State. The natural mental energy of the Child Ego state in the waking state coming from Spontaneity, Charm, Naivete, Boisterousness never comes to the fore and if this Child Ego State is released from the closet of the Parental Ego state , a relief from Schizophrenia is possible. As Dr Berne observes in Mr Troy’s case it needs a persistent theraupautic approach for a considerable period of time to end the inner captivity.",schizophrenia
231,"My own personal experience is that i see interdimensional beings and have experienced different ‘realms’ as well. I was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic with major depression.
Interestingly, i have witnesses to some of these events, so i guess first hand eyewitness’ can see my hallucinations too…
And i receive information downloads. Some say Akashic record, but its weird and different. Its accessed through the subconscious from your ‘minds eye’.
These dimensional beings enter our reality in strange ways. You learn things.
One being in particular enters into your perception as black billowing smoke in a VERY controlled fashion, taking 90 degree turns as it approaches. Then rising up taking the form of a cloak with no hands or face, just blackness, the darkest blackness i ever imagined. I gazed into its face and it transported me into the depths of the abyss of time…into oblivion for all of eternity. It lasted only a moment in our time. Those are the best words i have to describe it, with tears in my eyes…i have so many secrets. My wife witnessed that entire event from start to finish.
This past winter, it was snowing out. I bent down to place something under the kitchen sink. I then stood back up and gazed outside the window to look at the snow. But it wasnt snow. It was huge prehistoric bumblebees buzzing around the window. I could clearly see their gigantic wings flapping, dozens of them. I felt the urge to run for it, but i stood watching. Forcing myself to watch it unfold. Suddenly, a wall of clear plasma type material rushed past me from behind and through the window. When it touched the bees, they turned back into snowflakes before my eyes and the wall of plasma faded into obscurity.
Another time, i entered my back door to my house and made my way to the kitchen when a light, about 5 feet long and as slim as a human hair, floated past me. It went all the way through my house and disappeared out the back door. Moments later, my well trained dog went absolutely berserk. I even filmed it and posted on youtube. The dark ones came by…i guess this is all craziness from a schizophrenic…",schizophrenia
232,"Hi i was just wondering what you have learnt from schizophrenia? I’m 35 years old and i was diagnosed in 2006. In 2016 my diagnose was changed to full remission. I was hospitalized 4 months later and im back on meds… for about 30 years i felt nothing but anxiety. I have had 3 years of theraphy which did not help me much. I have gotten in contact with some people who have also suffered from mental disorders. And that has been a life changing experience. I have found a way into my emotions. Just by being honest. I have found out how important it is to be honest…. that has been my number one lesson learnt on my road to recovery.

233,"No. That was the last thing on my mind. And no, my symptoms weren't dramatic but they did develop rather gradually. The first symptom I could remember was when I was about 17 and I was feeling awfully sad. I was taking an advanced Calculus course and it had been causing me aniexty. Immediately, I assumed I was only stressed and did a lot of meditations and I started attending church like a madman! I was desperate for relief and frankly, I just wanted the semester over with. This helped a bit but it was more of a “Today, I feel okay but tomorrow, I feel terrible!”
I self diagnosed myself with depression. I battled this for about two years before I began hearing the voices. When it first happened, I assumed it was my subconscious but it was bothersome. It felt as if someone was talking in my ears and there was no way I could stop them.
I had many attacks and I would go into brain fogs. The brain fogs were the worse. I would sit in a place for hours, not moving and tried to think because I would forget so much.

It has ruined my life. It’s not that I can’t ever have good moments, enjoy my family. But it’s always there. It overshadows everything. I can’t trust my own senses at best. I do write about it often because it’s therapeutic- but even then I can only guess that I’m making any sense.
This illness is so virulent that you just don’t know when you cross that line and leave reality. Sometimes you’re in an in between state. Not fully anywhere.

236,"Can Schizophrenia Go Away? Understanding the Journey of Recovery
The Nature of Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a complex, chronic mental health condition that typically requires lifelong management. While it doesn't technically ""go away"" in the traditional sense, many people with schizophrenia can achieve significant improvement and lead fulfilling lives with proper treatment and support.
Treatment Success Stories
Many individuals with schizophrenia experience periods of stability and improved functioning. Research shows that:
25% of people achieve significant recovery
Another 50% show improvement with treatment
Early intervention leads to better outcomes
What Recovery Looks Like
Recovery in schizophrenia typically means:
Reduction in symptoms
Better daily functioning
Improved relationships
Return to work or school
Greater independence
""Recovery is not about 'curing' schizophrenia, but about managing symptoms effectively and rebuilding a meaningful life."" - National Alliance on Mental Illness
Factors That Influence Recovery
Several elements contribute to successful management:
Consistent medication adherence
Regular therapy sessions
Strong support system
Healthy lifestyle choices
Stress management
Early intervention
Modern Treatment Approaches
Contemporary treatment methods include:
Antipsychotic medications
Cognitive behavioral therapy
Family therapy
Social skills training
Vocational rehabilitation
Living Successfully with Schizophrenia
While the condition itself may not disappear, many people learn to:
Recognize early warning signs
Manage symptoms effectively
Build coping strategies
Maintain stable relationships
Pursue career goals
The Bottom Line
While schizophrenia doesn't ""go away"" completely, it can be successfully managed. With proper treatment, support, and dedication to recovery, many individuals with schizophrenia lead stable, productive, and satisfying lives.
""The goal isn't to eliminate schizophrenia, but to help people thrive despite it."" - World Health Organization
Remember: Every person's journey with schizophrenia is unique, and recovery is possible with the right support and treatment plan.",schizophrenia
237,"I'm not totally sure of a completely accurate answer here, but can share my own experience.
I was dx'd scizoaffective mixed bipolar type, as a teen, and no one told me 🤷‍♀️. There's been a lotta issues in my life, but I've barely gotten by. Finally, I was able to find some Docs who could help me with my insurance and have been in intensive covid style treatment for a few months now. They assessed and acknowledge the scizoaffective and I'm now on an antipsychotic and an anti-anxiety drug that have made all the difference in the world.
my symptoms, both positive and negative, have been there all my life. I think living in general, and all the consequences that go with that, kinda stock-piled up causing the symptoms to all get worse due to simple stress level in life. Like, you can look at the wake of carnage left behind you and eventually realize maybe it's you and not everyone else. It took me 46 years to get here. Ive had it all my life, it just took this long for it to get bad enough for me to do something about it.
Thx 🧚‍♀️",schizophrenia
238,"I think a lot of people believe that once you have schizophrenia it is all downhill, but that really isn’t true.
In my experiences without medication, I had episodes where I was worse and times when I was better. However, when I got really bad things went pretty far downhill pretty fast. I was usually put in the hospital when things were pretty far gone, because I was a danger to myself. In the hospital I was given medications, and I would usually improve quite quickly. It took a long time for me to realize that I needed to be stabilized on medications though.
Now that I’m on meds regularly, I don’t have those periods of crashing into psychosis, and I’m much more psychologically stable. My mood is better and my thinking is better. I still have ups and downs, but it is more like what regular people experience than anything else.
So, usually schizophrenia doesn’t just “come and go.” Once someone has it, most likely they will always have it unless they are very lucky. However, it does “come and go” in the sense that a person can have periods of wellness and periods of sickness if they aren’t medicated. Stress, drugs/alcohol, and other things can also cause something like a “flare-up” of symptoms. So, that’s why meds aren’t the only important thing in treatment. People with schizophrenia tend to do better with managed stress, no street drugs/alcohol, a good support system, and all the basics like stable housing, enough to eat, etc. in addition to medication.",schizophrenia
239,"i have had it since i was diagnosed as a teenager and within recent years have actually gotten better. rn me and my doctor have agreed i am stable without the meds so i am off of them..i wonder frequently will i ever truly be normal? WIll i always keep the pain inside and do the past experiences where i was a horrible person even matter in the long run..i think about life and death, i am normal like you in a sense where if we met, if i were to meet anyone reading this and we truly talked, we would probably get along great. But i have suffered absolute hell of delusions and everything that comes with the pain of being the odd one out in society. right now i make my own money with my own business and i live on checks that pay for my rent, i get ebt because i live in california and thats how i pay for food, i use the ebt for things like bananas tho and use my cash to buy raw nuts from amazon, i eat a raw foods diet. This isnt a claim
to say that the raw foods diet is fixing me, what it is doing is mostly addressing an underlying condition. i also have ibs and have learned i cannot properly digest non raw foods, i guess i could do an elimination diet and have more than just raw foods, but i found a solution and i stick to it because it works. The things i have to hope for in life are success with my business, coronavirus ending and becoming a student at the local college, keeping my housing, maybe meeting a woman or something. I hope within about a year or possibly less of sticking to my diet (i know it might not sound safe to someone but i hit every target, i get fats from avocados, protein iron etc from nuts, and everything else from fruits plus juice vegetables and frequently fast and work out nearly every day - only not working out if im doing an extended fast) - yes i hope i can heal enough to have a better time with things, no anxiety, at this point just what i got now is as close as it gets to a perfect life i got a big garage for a room ceiling fan heater roommates that leave me alone and a decent relationship with my landlord, i have enough money from my side stuff i do like seling maeng da products and coffee and vape juices, i live next to a food bank, super close so i tend to let that somewhat curate my meals for cheat days from the diet
but i often dont break the diet. Today is day 4, have been fasting for day 3 and 4, raw food day 2, juice fasting day one or water fastingg i think actually. All my blood work and labs and all that is always fine, and for yet another calculated rarity of a life experience i am not having accidents when i sleep or anything like that . For caffeine i still have that, i know its not raw but today i gave up the sugar free energy drinks, and i continue to enjoy coffee through a device on amazon called the aluball, which lets me cold brew it and doesnt upset my stomach.
my brain disease is very strange but i own it and am a prideful person. it does have some secret perks if you will…i have routinely done whatever is as close to real psychic powers as possible throughout my life, i have guessed things about people, i hit nails on their heads when i analyze just about everything, believe it or not even iwith this recent epidemic i KNEW Something horrible was to come and shake the world for months in advance. i knew it would have something to do with china but that was more of an intermittent thought, the constant here is i knew shit was about to get WEIRD. i have contact with what you might call spirit guides, no i dont talk out loud to them even when i have nobody around to see it. but i communicate with them, and another weird thing..they are people in the world, who i had met very briefly in life, and their exact faces and descriptions etc entirely match who they are in the world. Of course not every thing is fairytales and roses and i dont really have these people in my life.
in a serious note i have been single for SUCH a long time, with nothing serious ever developing, just the occasional online thing, i mean i have lots of friends who are females, and things can take on a deeper nature but i dont care about any of that i would rather meet someone in real life or something. But as far as just being real goes i dont even care anymore about that. I know if its meant i will get it and i take every step and meet all criteria to turn myself into who i want to be studying things online, online education, physical exercise which as i said i generally do everyday
my doctor and i are really cool, he likes me alot, he definitely agrees with me that i am stable right now. most people have no idea i have this condition and im not really big on just letting anyone know anymore but i tell people i suffer from psychosis and have always suffered from it. i have had symptoms since a boy hearing the devil talking to me when i was trying to sleep. My life kinda amounts tothis sort of war between me and whatever evil thing is trying to keep me in the same cage. it cant win. it was winning before but i knew it wouldnt keep winning. Whether or not thats even real depends on you and waht you believe, my life and reality is mine and i dont go blasting this information online looking for clout or trying to impress anyone thats not my character.
Well i guess this has been a bit long winded but if there is anyway to subscribe to a person on here (i dont use this site much, just offer the facts every now and then or share my take on things i have experience with) then you can subscribe to me because i think i can start helping the world more by offering advice n stuff on raw food dieting to other sufferers. i also know all too well how easy it is to say screw the medication or to believe it is harming you . ive been in every position with that. for a long time after i evolved passed that i accepted that the med was helping. After a while i wanted out due to my suspicion (and i am usually right), that its not doing me much good at this point and that its affecting my heart health and brain heatlh neagtively with things liket he warning signs of sleep apnea and endless brain fog and zero thoughts.
the only thing i can do from here is shape up some keep helping people and attempt to live the most positive life i know how to live. The weirdest thing is ive always believed life could be perfect. I think i am closing in on something that mirrors the exact beliefs i am manifesting thinking life could be perfect, simply by following prompts and taking a few steps here and there. have a good day. and if any of you have it, maybe switch to invega, its the least bad out of all of them as far as side efffcts go, and know diet and exercsie can help but wont cure. later",schizophrenia

At the most two or three 10day courses, with gaps of about 2 months in each course shall show excellent results. Pertinent to mention that lodging & boarding in these courses is free and the patient can continue taking his medicines during the courses.

242,"You don't say if you were formally diagnosed with schizophrenia by a psychiatric provider when this was happening to you so the question is difficult to answer.
I can tell you that when the psychiatric community talks about symptoms of schizophrenia and in particular “ voices”, they are not talking about consciousness. Thet are referring to sounds or voices heard Outside your head. For instance, your name being called, people whispering, a voice saying you're bad, a voice saying the food is poison, a buzzing sound, what sounds like two people talking but you can't make out what they are saying. These are some common examples my patients have described to me. Some people hear command hallucinations. These are more advanced when the illness is more advanced and they give what seem like specific instruction or direction.

244,"The answer to that is strictly imaginary.
“Schizophrenia” is there when we say it is there and not there when we say it is not there because it is a completely imaginary entity. It does not exist in the material world, and there is absolutely no objective or physical accountability for how we choose to define the concept — no way to show it being present or absent. It is just a label of convenience which is used when certain psychosocial criteria are subjectively met, and what happens after is totally up in the air. These boundaries and their application can also change from one time and place to another.
If we are talking about a non-physical entity which never physically comes or goes, we can just say whatever we want about whether it is there or not. It is up to us to invent the boundaries involved, and the boundaries we see in guidelines like the DSM and ICD are simply the most industrially popular boundaries — ones simply voted into use. Because labels like “schizophrenia” only come into play when someone is meeting certain psychosocial criteria, not meeting those criteria is the only way of conceptualizing an absence in the dominant paradigm of ‘psychopathology’.
That would mean that experiences which no longer meet the diagnostic criteria are as close to ‘gone’ as we could get within that popularized set of boundaries. Just as the criteria no longer being met does not tell us whether those criteria may be met again in the future, never meeting those criteria in the first place also does not tell us whether we may meet those criteria in the future. Nor does meeting the criteria now tell us about the future either way. There is never anything solid or scientifically valid or measurable involved; there is no falsifiable ‘coming’ or ‘going’ to speak to.
So, some people prefer to say that once you have a label, that label describes you FOREVER AND EVER, no matter what you experience in the future, no matter why you experienced what you did in the past. Some people don’t. Who is right? There is no such thing as ‘right’, here, unless you choose a position beforehand — a way of measuring rightness in this context. Because this is strictly up to our imagination, it seems somewhat flaccid to argue that something is definitively and universally ‘there’ if there is no concrete reason to believe so. But anyone is free to believe that if they want to. We can believe in ghosts, demons, unicorns or anything else we want to.
To speak of experiences sometimes labeled as “schizophrenia”, there is no general pattern to look to. The reasons for those experiences, their patterns of recurrence or non-recurrence, and what can help reduce their incidence or end up provoking them is highly variable. Many people who are labeled “schizophrenic” can work on whatever was leading to the experiences meeting diagnostic criteria and resolve those underlying concerns such that they never again meet those criteria. Sometimes experiences recur no matter what someone thinks to try. And others find themselves somewhere in between — perhaps your focus here?
“Schizophrenia” is just a hodgepodge label which refers to that entire spectrum of experiences. The dynamics are not interchangeable. The outcomes don’t make sense to statistically average. The way to successfully address any difficulties involved cannot be universalized. As soon as you start saying “schizophrenia does X”, you are bullshitting because it is not a ‘thing’ which can ‘do’ anything. It is just a perspective couched in a label, and that label does not refer to any specific or uniform set of experiences. It is heterogeneous, and relies on our beliefs rather than facts.",schizophrenia
245,"Schizophrenia is a progressive illness which means once you have it you will always have it and it will get worse over time.
However in my experience if a person learns to manage the illness then they can sometimes live a normal life.
I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia but I wasn't always complaint with medication. The medication caused sexual dysfunction and made me a zombie.
I had my last psychotic break in 2015 and when that happened I was hospitalized for 6 months. I was put on newer medication that had less side effects and I learned CBT and DBT.
Sometimes I still have symptoms when I take medication but I am able to hold onto reality and keep from being hospitalized. Even when I take medication I have not had a psychotic break.
I believe I have a mild case. I work as a software developer and am able to function. However I was unable to pass classes or function when I first got this illness. Schizophrenia is incredibly debilitating when you first get it. If someone is lucky enough to have loved ones they have a greater chance of getting where I am at.",schizophrenia
246,"I healed my mental illness. I got addicted to the medications and they were making my life worse and I was drugged. I found a spiritual path to replace the drugs which is finding love to replace the fear and lack of light in my life. I read “People of the LIe” by Dr. Scott Peck and he said the degree of a lack of self honesty is the label given to mental illness. I prayed to be as honest with myself as I can be as I did not want to have paranoid schizophrenia like my mother. I worked the 12 steps of AA and my psychiatrist declared me sane.
I have been off all medications for 24 years and now have real feelings, have grown up into maturity, and can make rational decisions for good results. I wrote how I released the past harms and abuse replacing them with love and grace. In “Paradigm Busters” at Amazon I wrote the process to move into reality; love is reality. I now have a daily conscious contact with my higher power which is sanity and live in the moment which is a gift and why it is called The Present. Love never fails.",schizophrenia
247,"No, but Psychosis does come and go. Schizophrenia is a (typically permanent) condition that does not disappear and reappear, if someone is diagnosed with schizophrenia they will most likely have schizophrenia for the rest of their life unless they get super lucky. Psychosis caused by schizophrenia is temporary though, it usually spikes when stressed, angry, or afraid. Psychotic states can also slowly build through a delusion, for example: if someone with schizophrenia is in a stable place where they’re not in psychosis, a delusion could “creep in”, starting with vague thoughts like “that person is watching me” and developing eventually to specific thoughts like “a specific person is watching me all the time and is planning to break into my home so I have to be ready to defend myself” and that leads quickly from a delusion into a psychotic episode.
TL/DR: schizophrenia is a permanent condition that causes psychosis, which is a temporary state of mind. Psychosis comes and goes. Schizophrenia does not come and go.",schizophrenia
248,"I have schizophrenia. It was undiagnosed and untreated for nine years.
When I woke in the mornings the room would be a funny grey color. Everything looked ‘wrong', like berries from the supermarket that are starting to rot. I would walk outside and see imaginary graves all around me, all the people and animals I'd ever loved.
I thought I was watched constantly. Going to the bathroom, working, making dinner. Someone was always watching me. Voices in my head never ceased. Usually they were the voices of people I loved, but instead of loving me back they would say insulting, belittling things.
The only way I could make the voices stop was to scream, yell, and howl louder than them. No amount of alcohol made them stop: they would follow me into unconsciousness. Because I heard them criticizing all the time, when the real person appeared I thought it was all true, that it was really them talking. My confusion was infinite. My delusional thinking was infinite.
During bad psychotic episodes, the yelling and screaming were so extreme that I would stuff a rag in my mouth and put on my motorcycle helmet and hide in a closet to try to muffle my own voice. Then came hallucinations. After the screaming and the hallucinations, catatonia set in, and I'd stand in one place, mouth hanging open, for long periods of time. This happened frequently.
I slept three hours a night, on average.
A great deal of the time I was unable to speak, unable to make decisions, unable to look up or make eye contact, unable to touch anyone or bear being touched, unable to start any activity, unable to read, unable to speak on a phone, unable to watch TV or use a computer. Aka, ‘negative symptoms’.
And I was considered ‘high functioning’.
I have now been sane for four years and 5 months. I do not take pharmaceutical antipsychotics.
I take 2500 mg a day of full spectrum CBD oil, which is an antipsychotic proven to be equal to, or surpassing, many pharmaceutical antipsychotics. With no side effects. There are many research studies from the last decade showing the antipsychotic effects of cbd, but you have to dig deep to find them. Much research is internatonal, due to US restrictions.
I also take 180 mg a day of Famotidine (aka pepcid ac, a histamine 2 blocker which happens to control the negative symptoms of schizophrenia).
This combination has no side effects for me, except that my back pain and arthritis have improved and I sleep 7 hours a night.
I would not return to a life of untreated schizophrenia. I cannot imagine anyone would. It is the definition of hell.

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

It can be the talk or action. Going out without control, when realized mind gets troubled and is called Schizophrenia. Conscious mind thinks that something is wrong that I am not able to control.

254,"Yes and no. Schizophrenia refers to a large set of inadequately and imprecisely defined behaviors. Those behaviors can be changed, but since schizophrenia is diagnosed by the opinion of a doctor, there's no way to control the doctors opinion, and most doctors are not influenced by facts and are influenced by their own subjective opinions.
The only way for schizophrenia to go away is if it is permanently ignored by the person who is accused of it. It's hard to permanently ignore the opinions of others, especially when they are powerful people, like doctors.
Once a doctor opines that you are schizophrenic, it's almost impossible to get them to change their mind. It's best never to consult them in the first place if you don't want to be considered schizophrenic forever.",schizophrenia

256,"No, if it really is schizophrenia, this is a persistent mental illness. Whoops, the question changed from what I brought up elsewhere. Mmmmmm. The question, I thought was about hearing chattering voices in childhood, and it going away, but could it return in adulthood ?
I’m going to answer it, and let Quora ( Quora Moderators, Gladiators of us Gadflies) decide) .
What you may have thought was schizophrenic like symptoms when younger are not true auditory hallucinations that are experienced as if coming from others outside, with taunts, commands to do or think certain things, but rather what is referred to as “Parental Imagos,” or the internalized “voices” of our actual parents, and influential others in our early formative years. These symbolic representational configurations become a part of our unconscious, and sometimes conscious psychic structures.
I’ve talked to people who I knew were not schizophrenic, who have described “hearing voices,” and when we discussed the matter, it became clear they were describing internalized parts of themselves, and not “external” voices. It relieves them in one respect, and may open up other important things to discuss.
Ya mean I’m not nuts, and it’s just my parents in my head ? !
Well, sort of.
Bruce Kugler, Ph.D.",schizophrenia
257,"Auditory hallucinations are the most common. Many people with schizophrenia hear voices, but some just hear other noises which nobody around them hear. I personally don’t usually hear clear voices talking, but I used to often hear mumbling, as if I was in a large room with about a hundred people all having separate conversations, so I couldn’t t discern what is being said. I sometimes would hear a sudden scream or my name being called from very nearby, almost from right next to me, but there was nobody there that I could see. Sometimes I hear very vivid buzzing as if a bee or wasp is right next to my ear, which is terrifying to me, I will literally abruptly attempt to get away from an invisible wasp. Other times I hear other sudden loud harsh noises right by my ear that startle me, to the point that my heart jumps and races and I pull a muscle in my neck etc and people around me laugh or look at me like I’m crazy because they don’t see what I’m reacting to.
Tactile hallucinations are pretty common as well, such as feeling bugs crawling on your skin or feeling like you just got hit or the feeling of a truck speeding by(a whoosh of air) etc
There are visual hallucinations, for me that is often shadows or hazy figures, that are sometimes the shape of a person, often i see insects on the walls or flying. When I was younger (the first time, I was 13)I had visual hallucinations when i looked myself in the mirror, i would see my teeth growing, I would see thick hairs rapidly sprouting out all over my face etc, it was terrifying. i’ve seen white rats scurrying along the wall. I have seen a cow sitting on top of a TV, a miniature Native American tribe chief walking by and waving at me i’ve seen the eyes in a painting move…sometimes these hallucinations were quite entertaining and I enjoyed them, in a way it was like tripping but without drugs.
There are also olfactory hallucinations, like smelling something burning, or smelling rotting food etc.
The problem for me in calling these things “hallucinations” is that I’m never convinced that they are in fact “hallucination” , meaning they are not “real” or there is no real source for the sounds, sights, sensations…just because others can’t perceive the things I do, doesn’t prove anything to me other than that others have different perceptive/sensory abilities than I do. Sometimes I can’t explain where what i sense originates from, but to me that still doesn’t mean it isn’t real, just that I am lacking insight and knowledge needed to understand it. I generally believe that there are many dimensions of reality and most people can only perceive what is in the one dimension of where their focus is and they have no ability to perceive anything from other dimensions, whereas I do.",schizophrenia
258,"Although I don't look for them anymore, when I was really developing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, I would find face outlines in trees and grass, often animated with the wind like they were talking or repeating words my mind would think of. This happened normally around fall after the leaves fell. I was smoking cigarettes quite a bit and this exacerbates it. Nicotine made me painfully susceptible to hallucinations both auditory and visual. Sometimes I'd hear a friend say “Now I hear!” But she wasn't actually there. I once made a list of all the things that were repeatedly said to include in a story, but I didn't include them in the end.
On a side note, oftentimes the visual hallucinations would joke around with visuals of outlines of various genitalia. As if to say, stop looking. I've since concluded that there are powers higher than me. I once saw a woman crying in a photograph. When things really intensified, the visual hallucinations and voices were very extreme and frightening, so I will not include those experiences.
I haven't had this trouble since moving home and getting on appropriate meds, which for a long time was either successful or trial and error. I take daily multivitamins, drink four liters of filtered well water and cut soda, alcohol and junk food out. I quit smoking for three and a half years and later started again with the determination I'd use vape and gum to supplement those needs. The gum helps me read in bed comfortably. I'm so grateful for this because it helps with logical issues. The water habit alone helped immensely and directly motivated me to get my rooms in order. Since March of 2012 I've hardly missed a day. I even wrote a novel summarizing my experiences in two characters as a sort of split personality where one is quite sick and the other is only starting to show symptoms.
If you are new to psychosis and get on meds, just know that the recreational drugs and alcohol have to stop. Meds don't operate well with any of it. I even have issues with sugar alcohol when taking antidepressants. I now take kombucha once in a while and haven't had trouble but some nicotine gum I react poorly to.",schizophrenia
259,"I’m not schizophrenic but I do have something similiar that gives me hallucination. For me it started as small things like hearing crows saying my name or seeing my younger sister in bed even when she then came into room. But it gets worse, I was always seeing someone in the edge of my eye staring at me, hearing someone walking behind me, or hearing dog behind me and starting running in fear. I was drawing under tree and suddenly worms started falling from the tree when I’m scared of worms. It wasn’t pretty. I wasn’t able to sleep because I was so scared. I’m now taking pills and I am not hallucinating so much anymore. There was more things that happened to me but I think telling this is enough",schizophrenia
260,"I’ll never forget how scared my Brother was the first time he told me he was hearing voices, It was 1978 at the time, he was 16 years old and I was fifteen. I had always suspected something was mentally different about my Brother from a very young age. As a fifteen year old in 1978, I didn’t have much knowledge of brain disorders. But, when my Brother told me he was hearing voices, before he was even diagnosed, I knew for sure he had Schizophrenia. My Brother confided in me quite a bit after that day. He would explain to me that he was hearing many scary voices at the same time, and they were telling him to do bad things to people. Most of the time he did as these voices told him to do, and he hurt people. He also thought he was “Jesus” quite often which made our Dad, “God” in his eyes. As much as my Brother suffered from hearing voices, I dont remember him ever telling me that he was seeing hallucinations. Some Schizophrenics may see things they think are real, but, my Brother only suffered with audio hallucinations… Having lived with it first hand, I believe Schizophrenia, is the saddest of all disease’s…",schizophrenia
261,"my common hallucinations, and I can only offer my experience, I would never claim to speak for all schizophrenics, are:
auditory
olfactory
visual
it’s my understanding that auditory is the most common among us with psychosis and visual is less common and olfactory is even less common, but I think it varies from individual to individual. if you want to know what someone diagnosed with schizophrenia most commonly has as hallucination types…those are mine. to elaborate a little:
auditory are mostly voices, though I often hear banging in the walls…and often the laughter/mocking me comes from voices within the walls or within other supposedly inanimate objects. sometimes I hear static, like radio static or what sound like alien voices being transmitted. I have major problems with wires buzzing, which apparently telephone or power lines DO, in fact, buzz sometimes…I just can’t tell whether that’s something heard by all or by me or by all but only I'm disturbed by it, etc.
the olfactory ones are disgusting smells…like the world smells like coagulating blood or, once, like feces everywhere….I believed I smelled like feces no matter how much soap I used to scrub myself.
visual ones have been corpses, graphic horror scenes flashing in front of me, I've seen my face melt in a mirror
oh, and I forgot to include the somatic ones…those are more frequent for me than olfactory but less frequent than auditory and visual: I feel my veins being pumped full of formaldehyde. I feel like I'm physically being made effete/embalmed/static. this is that hardest one to explain, but perhaps the most distressing one to endure.",schizophrenia
262,"I have had schizophrenia since I was 19. I’m 47 now. The voices don’t have a name. They say terrible things to me like, “you’re a piece of shit.” “You’re a fat ass bitch!” “Nobody cares about you!” “Look at you, you’re always last on everybody’s list!” Then I start to feel bad about myself and get depressed then I go for junk food to chase the voices away.
I cannot listen to the radio or read books that has people with MPD (multiple personality disorder) because it excites the voices and they speak gibberish and get very loud!
Sometimes I’ll think I don’t give a living damn about anybody and end up with bad karma.
A few times in my life, I would hear a child’s voice, speaking very clearly and coaches me to come to the living room or to look outside at night because they have something to show me. I refuse, because I don’t know what I’ll see and get scared.
Whenever I end up being traumatized, usually from being physically or mentally harmed by someone else, the voices would get loud and yell at me and talk very fast. Then I would start seeing things at the same time. I see glittery shapes and colors in a sheet in front of my vision. They don’t last long.
I’ve been stabilized for almost 5 years now, and learned to deal with the voices somehow. I learned coping skills such as doing arts and crafts, reading, or playing video games.

263,"What exactly are you in the market for? I’ve had too many visions during this whole deal, from hot dogs, to friendly brown blob people who lived in my closet, and the ones I have now, it’s a dude in metal armor holding a severed bleeding stinking head that screams non stop. Whatever your mind can twist to, you’re gonna see just about anything, it’s all possible. I couldn’t believe that anyone has a main vision type, so let your imagination run free.

Just please, Remember this, we are people too, and we already put up with our personal bullshit, we don’t need anyone else’s.",schizophrenia
264,"Hallucinations are a frequent symptom of schizophrenia and can manifest in a variety of ways. Auditory hallucinations, which entail hearing voices or other sounds that are not actually there, are the most prevalent sort of hallucination reported by patients with schizophrenia. These voices might be judgmental, disparaging, or commanding, resulting in painful experiences.
Other hallucinations that persons with schizophrenia may have include:
Visual hallucinations are the perception of seeing things that are not physically existent, such as people, animals, or objects.
Tactile hallucinations are feelings on the skin that are not real, such as crawling sensations or the sensation of something touching the skin.
Olfactory hallucinations are the perception of odors that are not actually there.
Gustatory hallucinations: Tasting things that are not actually present.
It's important to note that hallucinations are not the only symptom of schizophrenia and they can vary between individuals. Also, not all individuals with schizophrenia experience hallucinations. It's important to seek professional help to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",schizophrenia
265,"In my experience, they are all negative. I never have any positive hallucinations. Let me elaborate by telling you what I experience as a schizophrenic.
I hear demonic voices and experience tactile sensations of something clutching my right shoulder or I feel snakes crawl under me when I lie down. Sometimes, when I sit at my computer chair and lean back, I can feel something push into my back and roll back and forth. I also sense footsteps behind me as a demonic entity moves about me I can even feel or hear them.
I can feel it lean against the side of my seat cushion of my chair as I am typing this. I can also feel something move in my hair and am getting goosebumps on my arms and legs. It also just pushed into the back of my chair.
Just in the last couple of days, I also started seeing demonic faces flash in my mind. They are of a possessed woman with yellow eyes ringed with orange that with dark shadows around her eyes. She has black hair and her skin is white with a blue tint. There is some sort of crud and dirt on her face. She is filthy and has yellow teeth and is smiling a wide toothy grin at me. She looks like a thing of pure evil.
It reminds me of Reagan from The Exorcist but she looks completely different. I’ve never seen a movie with her in it before. I’m not afraid of it though. It just reminds me of an image from a horror movie.
They are just a quick flash of an image in my minds eye over my vision. I see it for an instant and then its gone. However, it happens multiple times per day. I’m getting goosebumps now as the demon is looking over my shoulder while I type. It says “what are you writing dumb ass? I told you I was a girl. You never believed me.”
Once, I saw it for a moment sitting on the couch looking at me. Another time, I also saw it walking along side of me mimicking my every move, walking back and forth while I was looking out the French doors to the backyard. I could see a reflection of it as an overlay in the glass from my mind’s eye. If that makes any sense? Basically, I knew I was looking out the French doors into the backyard. I did not actually see a reflection. Instead, my mind created a mental picture that was an overlay on my actual vision of the demonic girl following my every move. I knew I was not seeing her in the glass. She was appearing in my mind’s eye.
It keeps telling me to sell my soul or it says stuff in the first person making it sound like I’m selling my soul but KNOW that I AM NOT doing it. Its trying to trick me into making me think that its my thoughts except I KNOW that I am NOT ACTIVELY THINKING IT. I won't fall for its lies or tricks.
Each time it does it, I tell it “no” or “never.” I even cuss it out by telling it to “f%ck off!” I also quote the bible “what good is it to gain the world if you forfeit your soul.” However, it just says it again sometimes a few minutes later or even as short as 30 seconds later. Nothing stops it.
Once, it even caused pain in my left ear after it said it and I did not respond right away. It was like having something stab my eardrum. Then I said “never” and prayed “please God help me” and the pain stopped.
Thinking back to when I first came down with schizophrenia in November of 2017, the voice that I hear blasphemes God, the trinity of Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. It even commits the Unpardonable Sin ""whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not have forgiveness in this world or the next.""
When it says it, I would shake my head and try to think of something different to stop it but I can't. I hear what it says regardless. However, it would also show me images of words in a book that I was trying to block out from hearing too. Basically, it would show me words to spell out what it was saying too. So I guess I have been having visual hallucinations but didn't really realize it.
Come to think of it, when this demonic presence first revealed itself to me by sitting down next to me on a couch that I was sitting in, it laughed and showed me images of a man from the 70's around a campfire with other people wearing clothes from that time period. It told me it was in him before but it drove him to commit suicide and laughed about it.
However, now that its showing images of a possessed woman, I realize that I am getting visual hallucinations as well.
Its not helpful at all. Its a creature of pure evil.
I won't fall for its tricks. I'm too smart for that. Plus, God is helping me in my battle against it. God must be helping me because I am not losing my shit over this. I'm handling this without medication. I have to, because anti-psychotics don’t work for me so I stopped taking them.
Instead, I choose to ignore my symptoms to the best of my ability but post about them on Quora to try and help people living with schizophrenia.
If anyone has any positive experiences from their case of schizophrenia, I would like to know. Please comment and tell me about your experiences. Be it positive or negative. I would like to know. Thanks!",schizophrenia
266,"I'm assuming you are referring to the visual hallucinations that I may have rather than the audio ones or delusions.
Common ones that I have, that I am certainly lead to believe are fairly common are:
Shadows not fixed to anything and/or shadows that move independently of the object/person that casts them.
Handprints - 'bloody' or 'dirty' (red or black) appearing on walls, ceilings and floors.
Bursts of light and/or colour that might 'stain'
Insects or rats, more commonly insects, of varying numbers.
General distortions either in space/distance or in features.
They are fairly standard I'm afraid! I wish they were more bizarre or that i saw giant fluffy rabbits because that would be awesome.",schizophrenia
267,"I can’t answer the question very well as every person’s hallucinations are different, and what the person experiences is just not that much of a shared or universal pattern. It’s more individualized.
With the psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia, hallucinations aren’t constant. They can be in vision, hearing, sensations like feeling pressure, even rarely, smells. And hallucinations can change over time, or be quite different during a more severe episode.
And the hallucinations might be quite different just before the illness onsets, when it’s fully established, or later on in the illness.
It all depends on which part of the brain is getting affected most by the illness at that time.
Our vision, for example, is very complex and sophisticated. If you want to understand vision better, talk to someone who has visual hallucinations from schizophrenia.
So for example, you can get hallucinations that involve figures leaping out of paintings at you when areas of the brain that process depth perception, are getting more affected by the illness. At other times, you might not have those hallucinations.
You can get visual hallucinations of a shadow outline of a person, walking toward you in a brightly lit area, and not have low light hallucinations.
If I had to guess, I’d say low light hallucinations are commoner.
When the illness first starts, you might get glowing lines in the dark, things that are unusually lit up having a very exaggerated brilliance or unusual lighting effect, ‘flying mice’ (looks like smaller objects, usually those objects are darker and on a light background).
You might just hear whispers at first. And of course some people have full blown voices or clear human figures from the start.
If you are going to get visual hallucinations, a big hallucination area is faces. That’s because the processing of facial expressions is so complicated and involves so many areas of the brain. Faces may appear to float in the air without bodies, they may appear to ‘drip’ or ‘melt’ downward.
So, some examples - each one from one friend-
Red horizontal lines, bright areas, sounds that seem like very quiet explosions or louder scraping sounds, voices ridiculing him and telling him people hate him or saying nonsensical things like if he and a woman said certain trivial words, she’d sleep with him(unfortunately those never came true…)
a VERY loud voice yelling ‘tutti fruity!’ pretty much all the time.
A voice coming from the television, but speaking specifically to him about conspiracies to harm him, a voice that occasionally warned him of danger (such as to get off a bike trail with a sharp corner where oncoming cyclists weren’t visible) and occasionally said nonsensical things or things that could not be understood
A voice that claimed to be a demon and told my friend that she was going to be killed for her sins(she was the nicest person you could possibly imagine so the message made no sense anyway)
A friend who had autism, psychosis and intellectual disability - a voice in his head that told him to be bad and that he was a bad boy(his description).
A voice that sounded like God, plus seeing images of faces that appeared to be melting downward",schizophrenia
268,"I just posted this a while ago so sorry haha:
Anything that you sense that others don't (something that you see, for example. Or something that you smell.) Any sense, not just visionary or auditory even though those are the most common.
My son has paranoid schizophrenia and hallcinates. Here are some of his hallucinations that I know about.
Voices: The most stereotypical schizophrenic hallucination ever. I'm not sure what the voices specifically say to him, but I know it's all sorts of stuff. And occasionally it's human noises (screams, laughter) instead of just talking.
Flies: He sees and feels flies everywhere, all the time (as far as I know it never stops). On his eyeballs, in his nose and ears, under his clothes, on everything he sees and touches (and eats).
Smoke: Sometimes he smells smoke, like something's on fire, and he runs to get me and freaks out because he's mostly non-verbal and when he's stressed there's no way he can tell me with his words that there's apparently a fire in our house. After the first few times, I asked him when he calmed down and he pointed to our fireplace and the smoke alarm and then a picture of him at the fire station meeting the dog mascot costumed person (picture on the fridge).
Just random little scenes. Like animals jumping out in front of our car and disappearing right before they're hit, or random stuff mutating in odd ways and then snapping back to normal, or people looking at him threateningly and saying mean or scary things (but in reality they don't actually say anything).
Probably tons of other stuff that I don't know about. He is doing better overall, but today is a bad day (bad month, really haha) and he can't really even try to hold a conversation right now so I can't ask him.",schizophrenia
269,"The IPSS estimated that 70% of schizophrenia patients experienced hallucinations. The most common hallucinations in schizophrenia are auditory, followed by visual. Tactile, olfactory and gustatory are reported less frequently. Visual hallucinations in schizophrenia have a predominance of denatured people, parts of bodies, unidentifiable things and superimposed things. Overall, one gains the impression that the schizophrenic's visual world has a surrealist fairy tale flavor, populated with things that do not exist in the real world and people who appear in a symbolic, fragmentary or attenuated form.",schizophrenia
270,"I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia since 2015. When schizophrenia relapsed, or we can say when psychosis occured in me, I heard voices, I saw visual hallucinations, I felt someone touched my back and my shoulder, I was exposed to olfactory halluciantions, I was exposed to delusions, and many more. From 2015, when eid al-fitr to be percise, until now, I was attacked by psychosis five times. But before I continue, I will tell you a brief of insights about schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a very troublesome problem. It has taken away almost all my precious abilities. And it is still affecting my mind, the way I think, is slightly different than normal people, although I am typing this when I am not attacked by psychosis. And now I have memory problems, thinking problems, reasoning problems, problems that related to my imagination, lessons understanding ability problems, and many more. Let's go back to our topic. If you asked about only the voices. Then I will describe only about the voices.
At the beginning of my first psychosis, I began to hear voices. I was in love with my ex-girlfriend. And the voices said Lily (let's say it's the name of my ex-girlfriend, it is a pseudonym though). The voices said Lily all day long. The voices attempted to enhance my spirit by saying spirit!. And the voices encouraged me to go to college. The voices said to me about what to say to my parents and other people. At first, I thought I can communicate with other people who aren't around me without telephone. But after I recovered from psychosis, I realized that it was just an auditory halluciantion. But after some period of time, the voices began to bully me. I heard Lily's voices, some of my past friends, even the voice of president Joko Widodo. Sometimes when I couldn't sleep during my psychosis, the voice of Lily said to me, ""sleep!"". The voices bully me by saying idiot, stupid in javanese, useless, shut up! and etcetera. It was a catastrophe. The voices continued to bully me until I recovered from psychosis. My first psychosis period was about one and a half month.
The second psychosis occured in 2016. It was fasting month. And my second psychosis was the worst of all my psychosis. I even couldn't walk. And of course I couldn't sleep at all. The voices bully me again. I heard the voice of the girl whom I love the most. Let's say her name is Dinar. The voice of Dinar said, ""Kill!"". And after that I heard the voices of many people attempted to bully me. From my memory, more or less the voices on my mind said, ""you are a loser, get out from here!, I don't love you, Sorry I don't want to be your girlfriend, monkey!, dog!, your brain is in the ass! you are like a robot!"", and etcetera. I don't want to experience those again. So I will drink my drugs diligently and regularly everyday.
As an addition, here are some tips about how to prevent psychosis.
1. Drink your drugs diligently and regularly;
2. Get injected with drugs every month;
3. Get a lot of therapies. For example: accupuncture, bekam therapy, nerves massage (totok syaraf);
4. Do sports everday. Or exercise everyday;
5. Avoid irrational thinking;
6. Avoid hoping too much that you might cannot achieve;
7. Improve your intelligence. For example:
- Learn new languages
- Learn to play instruments
- Write a diary everyday
- Play simple math games
- Solve puzzles
- Read, read, and read
- Study biology to improve your memory
- Study math to improve your reasoning ability
- Train your brain using a brain training application like lumosity
- Review all you have learned everyday
8. Do a lot of refreshing activities everyday;
9. Draw closer to your God;
10. Rest well. It means you must sleep well each night.
I hope that answer your question and I hope that helps.",schizophrenia
271,"I first started hearing them when I was going through a job loss and my girlfriend was really leaning on me to get my stuff together. All of a sudden, I thought I was hearing my neighbors hacking me, my computers, cell phone, tv….
Like I could overhear them talking about what I was watching. Then I went to the library and I could still hear someone over my shoulder…..Then I went to our house and started looking for listening devices and microphones and that is when my girlfriend caught me taking apart her ceiling fan, she told me to GET OUT.
It progressively got worse, like they were the police or some other law enforcement and started telling me to fry all my hard drives and electronics cause I’m going to jail. It got to the point where I could hear my friends talking to the voices, maybe six different voices, one at a time, in total, like, they were on the phone with them discussing my capture. After a few days of this, I wanted to test this, “this”….Take me to jail or whatever….That is when I called the cops on myself, saying I was going to do bodily harm to myself.
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. I had lost about 25 pounds in just a matter of a few weeks and was never sleeping. I spent only three days in the hospital.
I went on the drugs for about a month and a half, but I could still hear different “people/ voices” talking about me and to me, but in very very low tones.
This time though and going forward, I am armed - I know- without a doubt they are auditory hallucinations and they are full of it. Most of the time they are critical, negative, and tell me everything I cant do. Occasionally, they tell me I’m good looking in my suit, but they always repeat what I am doing to another voice and that other voice repeats it back, like they are in some huge room talking to a group.
Extremely Annoying!!!!!!
Top phrases I hear:
“He has no idea…” then they kind of pause for me to add my own thought to that. They repeat this so many times its ridiculous! I dont feed in now…but arggghh!!
“You dont know what this person is really doing to you”
“That’s all he thinks about”
“You will never be (my profession)” or “You will never make it as ……”
“He loves ………”
“He loves to talk about himself”
“He always looks at himself in the mirror”
“He is….(then enter anything thing I might be doing)”
——Now, I’m not going to go through those phrases one by one, but when I wake up in the morning to brush my teeth - I HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR. :)
——I am sharing this because if you just started experiencing the same thing or are going through this and are starting to think you are a “TI” Targeted Individual…ITS NOT REAL. What I found is the more power you give that side of your brain the worse it gets.
They tell you not to take a shower - I took a shower.
They said not to travel to visit my friends, that supposedly were trying to set me up. I went to my friends and waited to be set up.
They told me to break up with my girlfriend because they know that she is cheating. I kept going out with her.
——The more I did to test and buck the voices the more I grew, and know I am the master of my mind. So now….8 months later - I can say I dont have delusions, but I still experience very annoying subtle voices that seem to be not me. The delusion would be to think someone has 24/7 365 torture satellite technology to go after poor little you….I mean come on - you're not that important.
One other tidbit… schizophrenia has positive and negative effects on people. The voices are an example of the positive….The non-motivation, dont really care about the world would be the negative - And that is the one that is a silent killer for me. Now I choose not to take my Rx because I live in the USA and seem to be able to still point out several people a day crazier than me. But I am never scared to ask for help and would go back on my Rx, in a second if I saw I was going down the dark road. I hope this helps one person- we are not alone. Just get out of the house, make plans every weekend for family or friends, get a dog to go on walks….Mind and Body - Let the body do the heavy lifting for a while.",schizophrenia
272,"I'd say snakes. Seeing snakes that arent there. They’ve been around longer than we have and im pretty sure weve always had a fair reason to fear them. It would seem likely they are very deep rooted in our subconscious, and would probably be one of the most likely types of visual hallucination to show up in the mind of someone who is, or is becoming out of touch with reality.
As for auditory hallucinations, which are far more common than visual ones, it could be someone you dont know saying your name, over and over throughout the day for days, it could be something that became a pattern from the person experiencing it that they have repressed, or simply an overly critical voice talking about everything happening thats much louder and clearer than a simple internal monologue or basic conscience, specifically that when experienced the person knows/believes that it is not their own voice. It is beyond their control, like someone talking, but still in the way one would think. Not every hallucination in indicative of psychosis, though, and someone can be psychotic and not be experiencing hallucinations. they could only have delusions. When the disorder is in some of its more serious stages, the psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions can all play off of each other and cause a downward spiral. And it can be more intense and problematic.
But for many many people psychosis is manageable to some extent. Some take medication, some do not. I have firsthand experience I have schizoaffective and ive been off meds before, but even with meds, the symptoms are still there some, it takes effort on your part, to want to be productive and functional. Personally its taken me years to accept my hallucinations and i dont have them much anymore. People dont understand that someone can be psychotic but not all the time.",schizophrenia
273,"Differing from seeing things like I would see in a room around me I see figures, sometimes two variants that say thay are like each other but with different characteristics near each other, on one side I see a figure with curly hair mostly shoulders up, and sometimes near them a younger figure, making lots of action gestures, they have different emotional affects and word styles and make the voices I hear in my head, then at the other side I also see one or two figures, they say various things, and all of the figures sometimes say what they think I should say or think what I call Words at my mind Or streamlined thoughts, next I also think thoughts on my own, and write words and have ideas of my I own which I prefer. Sometimes the figures say are things I touch say they are things I touch, like nicotine is a particular figure, and the corn pops are a yellow-group figure, and if I lay in one position in bed that is another figure. Sometimes the figures say they have names. The figures change daily or monthly. One suggested it was going to teach me to draw, but seeing that figure more seemed to me like the thing to avoid so I drew less for a few hours, now I draw stuff again.
I am on medication which I think makes a big beneficial difference, and am trying to get more antipsychotic drugs online. I think going one antipsychotic medications earlier rather than later is beneficial to people, so if you have any symptoms of schizophrenia I mildly and politely urge you to see a doctor.",schizophrenia
274,"Yes.
But.
It’s unlikely to stay that way. I knew a girl a few years back, I’ll call her Rachel (not her real name). Rachel was 23, and we were admitted to the psych ward around the same time. She had scitzoaffective disorder (scitzophrenia + a mood disorder, in her case it was depression). Rachel was quiet, but we ended up talking. She told me that she had been hearing a voice since she was about 15. She said the voice was always kind to her, and told her positive things. Rachel was very religious, and she told me that she thought the voice was God. She didn’t realise she was unwell, she was just listening to God speak. The voice kept her company, helped her cook new recipes, and although her friends at school often thought Rachel was “odd”, nobody ever thought anything was wrong. This continued for years. Rachel grew to love and trust this voice of God. Slowly, the voice started to change. It told her to hurt herself. She did, because she trusted the voice, and at this point, followed anything it said. Things escalated. The voice told her to smash a brick over her head, to kill her dad (she didn’t), to jump in front of a train (she tried). Rachel was grabbed by the police on the train platform, and taken to a 136 suite (emergency psychiatric hold in the UK which lasts up to 24h where you are assessed to see if they need to admit you to hospital). She was admitted to hospital under section 2 (28 days) and treatment began. She got better, basically, although the voice never fully went away. The medication quieted it, and she came to realise that it wasn’t God after all, and that she needed to challenge what it said to her. But the point is, yes, hallucinations CAN be all positive. Maybe even for many years. But things change, and you could end up in serious danger.",schizophrenia
275,"Auditory hallucinations are among the most common psychotic hallucinations. One may hear voices whispering , laughing, telling you various threatening or nonsensical things. It may be like you are listening to several people whispering in a conversation—or they may speak directly to you—telling you that someone is dangerous and is going to hurt you. They may accuse you of being gay, a rapist, sexually deviant in some way, a murderer, etc. In paranoids, they may encourage some to violence. Music and other sounds are less common. In some the voices may be friendly; unfortunately in many the voces are threatening.",schizophrenia
276,"Each person has their own experiences and symptoms. But, the main ones I guess are
Visual hallucinations involve seeing things that aren’t there. The hallucinations may be of objects, visual patterns, people, or lights.
For example, you might see a person who’s not in the room or flashing lights that no one else can see.
Olfactory hallucinations involve your sense of smell. You might smell an unpleasant odor when waking up in the middle of the night or feel that your body smells bad when it doesn’t.
This type of hallucination can also include scents you find enjoyable, like the smell of flowers.
Gustatory hallucinations are similar to olfactory hallucinations, but they involve your sense of taste instead of smell.
These tastes are often strange or unpleasant. Gustatory hallucinations (often with a metallic taste) are a relatively common symptom for people with epilepsy.
Auditory hallucinations are among the most common type of hallucination. You might hear someone speaking to you or telling you to do certain things. The voice may be angry, neutral, or warm.
Other examples of this type of hallucination include hearing sounds, like someone walking in the attic or repeated clicking or tapping noises.
Tactile hallucinations involve the feeling of touch or movement in your body. For example, you might feel that bugs are crawling on your skin or that your internal organs are moving around. You might also feel the imagined touch of someone’s hands on your body.",schizophrenia
277,"Auditory hallucinations - hearing voices that tell them to do certain things or hearing commentary on things that are happening in their life. Eg. Patient hears a voice during conversation with a friend telling them their friend is evil and to become violent with them
Visual hallucinations - seeing things that aren't really there. Eg. A boat floating on the floor as you lay in bed
Smell-based hallucinations (I'm not sure what the technical term for this is) - smelling things that aren't really there. Eg. Smelling petrol when you're standing in your bedroom
Tactile hallucinations - feeling things that aren't really there. Eg. Feeling bugs crawling on your skin when no bugs are present
These are the main ones",schizophrenia
278,"I believe the most common type of hallucinations are auditory hallucinations. In general, most common ones are:
-hearing voices, be they calling your name, telling you to do things or commenting about your actions or surroundings
-ringtones, songs, barking, knocks, ticking, clocks, footsteps, breathing
-seeing people, shadows, light orbs, cats, bugs, birds or things in the corner of your eye
-feeling touched, tingling, bugs crawling under your skin or breathing on you
-smelling rotten meat, sweets, foul smells, perfume
-tasting different flavours
These are the most common experiences of psychosis. I do mot have schizophrenia, but I do experience psychosis because of other mental illnesses. Of course, the experience is not the same for everyone, I just listed the ones reported the most.",schizophrenia
279,"Psychosis is a state of being when it appears like your mind is playing tricks on you. But it isn't actually. People who experience psychosis have hallucinations ; auditory , visual , olfactory, tactile etc and also experience delusions. Delusions are disturbances in thought. I had an 18 yr old male patient wake up one day and think he was 3 days old. Hallucinations are perceptual disturbances so for instance people hear things that others don't hear, smell things that others don't smell , feel like they have bug bites on their skin when they don't etc. They also have fewer filters than we do and they can't filter out what is important to listen to and what isn't. They hear everything at the same decibel.

280,"Psychosis is a broader diagnostic entity. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. People can get psychotic for more reasons than just being schizophrenic; for example, severe depression, bipolar disorder, mania, cognitive brain issues, etc. also, some psychotic disorders are in reaction to extreme stressful events and go away afterwards.
People with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have psychotic symptoms outside and of major depressive or manic symptoms. That's the difference.

281,"I. Definitions:
“Schizophrenia” is the label of convenience for a heterogeneous collection of physical, psychological, and sociological experiences.
This collection contains a variety of potential contributing factors and a range of different possible personal experiences. It is defined by external observers based on their own ideologies rather than the physical or psychological workings of the person being labeled.
Aside from being a label with arbitrary criteria, it has no binding or objective physical or functional definition, and is considered idiopathic: it literally means “we have no idea why someone is experiencing these things”.
“Psychosis” is the label used in some cultures for a group of experiences considered to be departing from the socially normative conceptualization of “reality”.
The scope and nature of this idea varies from one place and time to the next. It is a subjective rejection of the subjective experiences of others, and is an enforcement of popularity rather than a description of someone’s health or wellbeing.
If your experiences differ significantly from those which are considered “normal” by your culture, this can create situations of disempowerment or danger for the person considered “out of touch” with those popularized perspectives. In this way, experiencing something others may call “psychosis” is not inherently benign or solely the concern of an individual unto themselves.
II. Applications
“Schizophrenia” as a diagnosis is meant to circumscribe at least one episode of “psychosis”, amongst other criteria, but does not require an ongoing “psychosis”. On the other hand, “psychosis” does not require or imply someone should be labeled as having “schizophrenia” by modern psychiatric definitions (such as the DSM or ICD).
As there can be many different physical and psychological reasons why someone may be experiencing things labeled as “psychosis” or “schizophrenia”, the distinctions are semantic rather than medical—particularly because there is no objective way to define or test for either of these ‘states’.
One noteworthy difference, however, is that sustained experiences of “psychosis” caused by non-psychiatric conditions, such as intoxication or vitamin deficiency, are oftentimes still termed “psychosis” even if that physical cause is known whereas “schizophrenia” is no longer considered “schizophrenia” if a physical cause for the experiences being described is identified.",schizophrenia
282,"Psychosis is a syndrome or group of symptoms. Someone experiencing an episode of psychosis is having a ‘break’ with reality. Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren’t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense—hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch. Delusions are strong beliefs that can’t possibly be true. Common delusions include the belief that someone is following or monitoring you, or the belief that you have extraordinary powers or abilities. Other symptoms of psychosis include difficulties concentrating, completing tasks, or making decisions. Thoughts may feel ‘jumbled’ or confused. Some people have a hard time following conversations or speaking clearly. Psychosis can even affect the way people move or express their emotions.
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms. And it isn’t the only cause of psychosis. In some cases, other mental illnesses cause psychosis, including depression, bipolar disorder, dementia and borderline personality disorder. Psychosis may come up during times of extreme stress, a major lack of sleep, or trauma. People who are using or withdrawing from certain drugs or medications may experience psychosis. Psychosis may also be caused by a brain injury, neurological problem, or other health problem. So while psychosis can be a part of schizophrenia, it can be caused by many other things too.",schizophrenia

I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!

I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it.

differences will be a expained by describing each
schizophrenia: a chronic ailment whose symptoms can include psychosis (delusions of various types and/or hallucinations that can associate with one or more senses), negative symptoms (lack of something…psychosis is a “positive symptoms” insofar as it’s added experience. “Negative symptoms” are removals of experience ; e.g. anhedonia, asociality, loss of speech, loss of thought), and disorganized symptoms (thought disorders, disorganized appearance—wearing ten layers when it’s ninety outside—disorganized emotional response), and must persist more than six months, and affect at least two spheres of life; I.e., school, relationships, self care, work, etc.
psychosis: a symptom that can be found in many disorders, characterized by hallucinations (auditory, visual, olfactory, somatic, gustatory) and delusions (persecutors, grandiosity, reference, thought, etc). Psychosis NOS is a diagnosis whereby the criteria aren’t met for something else, but psychosis is present/one has an episode. Psychosis can have chronic and episodic presentations. Untreated, an episode of psychosis can last years. It’s considered a “positive (something added that’s not in normal experience) symptom” of sz and sza. It can feature in bipolar, depression, and OCD as well.
schizoaffective: symptoms of both schizophrenia (a psychotic disorder) and mood disorder (either bipolar or unipolar depression) are present. You must at times have psychotic symptoms without mood dysregulation, but mood dysregulation always comes with psychotic features. There are two subtypes, bipolar and depressive.",schizophrenia
286,"Most people high in schizotypy don’t suffer from full-blown psychosis, but will show milder versions of the same symptoms, with more capability to question their thoughts. However, high levels of schizotypy are a risk factor for developing schizophrenia.
Have you ever thought to yourself “hey, maybe everyone on the planet is fucking crazy”? Well, guess what? All of us view the outside world through a representation created by our minds, which are always less than perfect. The human brain is a marvelous instrument capable of great wizardry, yet it is always prone to glitches and distortions.
Schizotypy is a model of personality functioning that places people on a continuum of schizophrenia-like traits and sensory experiences. According to this way of looking at things, schizophrenia is an extreme version of traits which we all possess. Everyone has some schizotypy. Schizotypal personality disorder lies along the same scale, less disabling than schizophrenia but otherwise similar in many respects. Below there, a person may show schizotypal traits, without meeting criteria for a disorder.
Elevated schizotypy often occurs among the relatives of people with full-fledged schizophrenia, and may confer advantages in creativity. A moderate degree of schizotypy might like look someone who’s an original thinker, a bit disorganized, and believes some weird ideas about the government, but manages to function in society. The scale goes all the way from a benign level of creativity and magical thinking, to hearing God’s voice warn you on the bus to work about the demons possessing your bus driver and your fellow passengers.
Schizotypy traits are divided into positive, negative, and disorganized groups, modeling the symptoms of schizophrenia.
Psychosis involves a breakdown of one’s connection to reality, with a loss of reality testing. It becomes very difficult to distinguish imagination from fact. If you have a psychotic break you might hear voices calling you a worthless piece of shit, believing they’re real. You might call the police because you’re convinced your roommates are plotting to poison your food. Or you could just flip out internally and hide from everyone for a while, without anything too drastic occurring.
Schizotypy: Looking Back and Moving Forward
Abstract This article introduces and reviews the history of the construct of schizotypy for the special section appearing in the journal. Schizotypy offers a useful construct for understanding the etiology, development, and expression of schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology and a unifying construct for linking a broad continuum of clinical and subclinical manifestations. The article reviews the descriptive psychopathology roots of schizotypy, Meehl and Claridge’s classical formulations of the construct (including the debate about dimensional vs taxonic structure), and the need for a comprehensive, multidimensional model of schizotypy. The article briefly reviews the wide empirical literature supporting schizotypy and also examines several criticisms and misconceptions about the construct and research methods used to assess it. Finally, the article offers several suggested goals for future schizotypy research. Key words: schizophrenia, schizotypal, psychosis proneness Overview Schizotypy offers a useful and unifying construct for understanding schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology. Useful in that it has explanatory power for understanding the development, expression, trajectory, risk and resilience, and treatment of schizophrenia-spectrum conditions, as well as for understanding variation in normal behavior , and unifying because it encompasses a broad spectrum of conditions—schizophrenia, related psychotic disorders, spectrum personality disorders, the prodrome, and subclinical expressions—under a single conceptual framework . Furthermore, schizotypy allows us to examine the etiological and developmental pathways underlying schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology while minimizing many of the confounding effects that complicate the study of patients. However, the construct of schizotypy has suffered from the lack of a clear identity, as well as from conflicting identities in the literature, and the term is often used interchangeably with a variety of other descriptors. Nevertheless, schizotypy is an increasingly studied construct with a recent PsychInfo search (completed July 22, 2014) of the term indicating more than 1100 publications (including more than 400 since 2010). This brief review traces the history of schizotypy, differentiates it from related constructs, attempts to offer an integrative definition, addresses criticisms regarding the construct, and offers recommendations for future studies of schizotypy. Brief History of Schizotypy The term schizotypy was introduced more than 60 years ago to describe a broad phenotype of schizophrenic–like psychopathology and impairment. However, the origins of schizotypy date back at least another half century, and drew from both clinical and personality traditions. In the clinical domain, Kraepelin 1 and Bleuler 2 described schizophrenic–like traits in patients prior to their illness and in the relatives of patients. Kraepelin described these mild and subclinical symptoms as precursors to dementia p

287,"First, you should know that these terms are used to define behaviors that are not considered acceptable by society. They are meant for control by the psychiatrists who label a person that way. That person might be hospitalized or given medications against their will. Having this type of diagnosis is stigmatizing.
I recommend you read The Medicalization of Society, by Dr. Thomas Szasz.
These terms cover a wide spectrum of behaviors. One could say, for instance, that a particular political leader is psychotic, based on their actions.
The definitions of psychosis and schizophrenia constantly change. Usually the term “schizophrenia” is someone exhibiting “psychotic” behavior. In other words, “psychosis” is a more general term. The other answers deal well with these definitions and distinctions.

288,"Psychosis is a broader diagnostic entity. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. People can get psychotic for more reasons than just being schizophrenic; for example, severe depression, bipolar disorder, mania, cognitive brain issues, etc. also, some psychotic disorders are in reaction to extreme stressful events and go away afterwards.
People with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have psychotic symptoms outside and of major depressive or manic symptoms. That's the difference.
Schizophrenia is probably the worst mental disorder. It can cause delusions, hallucinations, cognitive/brain problems, thought disorder, even incoherence, and the lack of ability to experience pleasure. Think about that. Worst of all they are stigmatized and there are no great medicines for the negative symptoms.
With the exception of paranoid schizophrenia, those who suffer usually have a downhill course. The disease progresses with time.
For example, the medications that work can cause metabolic syndromes,movement disorders, and other problems.
They are terrified and their fear is literally existential. “""Do I exist? ""
If you know how to work with them and appreciate their suffering, it is very rewarding to work with them. The level of their suffering is so palpable even making a dent in the pathology will improve their quality of life.
Despite popular belief by even mental health clinicians, they benefit greatly from supportive psychotherapy.",schizophrenia
289,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
290,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

291,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.
A very dear friend. A gem of a person. Wish the best for him, wherever he may be now.",schizophrenia
292,"Psychosis is being disconnected from reality that can show itself in many ways - you could experience delusions, hallucinations, etc..and when you do, it *could* be a part of schizophrenia.
It could also be due to drug use, a medical problem (brain tumor, etc..), or another mental illness…we sometimes see psychosis in bad cases of depression for example.
Hope this answers your question.",schizophrenia
293,"Psychosis means that someone is out of touch, or disconnected from consensual reality. In psychosis a person is living in their own special reality…out of touch with others.
Schizophrenia is a distinct illness that can, when active cause psychosis. One can be schizophrenic but not psychotic when stable.",schizophrenia
294,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
295,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

297,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
298,"Psychosis is a general class or category of symptoms. The symptoms include hallucinations (often called ‘hearing voices’ though the sounds heard can be any sound, not just voices, and hallucinations can also be seen or felt physically). Another psychotic symptom is delusions - an idea or feeling a person can’t get rid of, even if he or she wanted to. Typical themes are the belief oneself is a being of great importance such as Jesus or God, the belief oneself is in great danger from some type of threat.
People usually refer to psychosis as ‘being out of touch with reality,’ a term people commonly use for other situations, and which causes only more confusion about what psychosis is.
For example you might say my ideas about solving homelessness are ‘out of touch with reality’ because they are expensive or won’t work with some people. You’re saying you disagree with an idea I developed over time.
And that has nothing to do with psychosis. Psychosis is due to a really serious miscommunication within the brain, or an illness that affects the brain.
As an example, my brother became psychotic, just for a few hours, of course, when he had a high fever during German Measles infection. He was terrified that spiders were crawling all over his bed. He could see them and would point to them and tell me to make them go away. He was about 5 or 6 then, I think. Once his fever came down the hallucinations stopped. Our wise old house-call making doctor had seen this many times before in his 83 years, said to keep the lights low and keep everything very quiet in the house, which did help. But getting the fever and infection down was what was needed.
Other causes of temporary psychosis - substance abuse, alcohol withdrawal, severe illness that upsets the electrolyte balance in an elderly person, such as kidney infection. Some types of poisons, and excess of a few medications, like one used to treat Parkinson’s.
Longer-lasting psychosis can be due to more severe depression, or other disorders. It can also occur in Dementia. Some types of dementia, like Fronto-Temporal Dementia, are thought to be more likely to cause psychosis. My friend’s grandfather got fronto-temporal dementia and at one point had the delusion that his wife was unfaithful to him.
Schizophrenia is a specific illness. There are psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions) but also other symptoms as well. Lethargy, loss of drive, cognitive symptoms.
For example my friend had schizophrenia and believed he was an Old Testament king. A religious friend would call and talk to him for hours and hours, quoting the Bible, but was unable to convince him his ‘idea’ was wrong. It’s not an ‘idea’ in the usual sense because it is caused by the illness, not by thinking, research or theorizing.
We also use the general term ‘Psychotic disorders’ which include Schizophrenia, Bipolar and other similar disorders.
So - psychotic - a type of symptoms. Schizophrenia, a specific illness that has, among other symptoms, psychotic symptoms.",schizophrenia
299,"Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and a distorted perception of reality. Symptoms of schizophrenia typically include hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorganized or catatonic behavior. Psychosis is a broad term that refers to a mental state in which a person experiences a loss of contact with reality. Psychosis can be caused by a variety of factors, including mental illness, substance use, and physical illness. Symptoms of psychosis may include hallucinations, delusions, difficulty concentrating, and disorganized thinking.

300,"Psychosis is a general term for a set of conditions which are common in people who have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and to a lesser extent, severe depression and occasionally borderline personality. Psychosis refers to a break with reality with regard to perceptions (auditory, visual, tactile or other hallucinations), odd, unusual or bizarre thoughts or beliefs which are incorrect (delusions), and/or (confused or illogical thought (thought disorder).
Psychosis is also common in neurological disease such as brain injury or dementias (including Alzheimer's) and less often can occur with medical illnesses such as Parkinson's, hepatic (liver) disease, hyperthyroid disease and many others. It is actually fairly common in elderly women who have urinary tract infections.",schizophrenia
301,"I am the mother of a daughter with schizophrenia. It becomes severe if the medications aren't working. Severe looks like this: visual, auditory and sensory hallucinations. My daughter would see things that weren’t there, hear things that others didn’t and smell things that no one else could. For example, she could smell cigarette smoke and thought her twin brother was smoking when he wasn’t. She would hear helicopters that were coming to take her away. She would see people and dark shadows that made her shake with fear. During a psychotic episode she has trouble sleeping, eating and regulating her emotions. Anger is a very common emotion of the unmedicated schizophrenic. Unfortunately that is the only version you see in the media…the suicidal, homicidal, uncontrollable one. My daughter also has cerebral palsy and would never hurt a fly when she is healthy. When she is sick she gets angry at the disease and why she has to have it but doesn’t lash out at people. Relationships are very hard to maintain when you have schizophrenia because you are less likely to reach out to others and prefer to be alone. That being said she is never truly alone because of the voices that she hears in her head. The meds can help quiet them but they never fully go away for her. In a severe phase the voices become mean and try to command her to do things. I am so grateful for the medication that helps those who suffer from this very debilitating and unusually cruel mental illness. If you are struggling with this or if someone around you is, be very patient and very compassionate. When I get to the end of my rope and want to scream, I tie a knot and hang on. Schizophrenia is a bumpy ride!",schizophrenia
302,"(I want to preface this; considering how many comments and messages I’ve received, I am not religious, I do not believe in God. I appreciate the well wishes and if you believe in God and pray, that is wonderful but please don’t tell me to trust in God/Jesus and pray because that is not something I believe in or do. I fully support you if you do, so please be respectful and support me in that I don’t. Also; I appreciate recommendations on things to try with her… but I can’t actually do any of the suggestions, I’m not her care provider.)
Schizophrenia is one of several mental ailments my biological mom suffers from. Hers is so severe that she is not compatible with life in the “normal” world. She has been committed since 1995. I was just 4 years old when she became a ward of the state of Texas.
With age, her symptoms have definitely gotten worse. I actually just saw her a few days ago. This was by far the worst visit we have ever had. It’s hard to process. I grew up with my mom being institutionalized. I rarely saw her. I still rarely see her. I’m 31 years old and I’ve spent decades educating myself on her illnesses. I’ve joined support groups. I’ve talked to those who suffer and loved ones of those who do. I’ve tried my damnedest to understand everything she experiences to the best of my ability but it is still so damn hard to see it in person with someone you love so dearly. My mom will never be able to lead a normal life, and that breaks my heart.
This is my mom and I in October of 2023.
Oh look.. another troll.",schizophrenia
303,"Pretty serious. I have an added bipolar mood disorder attatched. But let me just try to speak on the schizophrenia part. Even though I think things would've been more tolerable by a large margin had I hadn't h as d to th olerat ed th he mood disorder ontop of the schizophrenia.
Now there are several types of schizophrenia. Paranoid or paranoia seems to be the most popular. I WAS NEVER PARANOID! I was more the “disorganized"" type.
Which for me is more treatable. I had a “monotone"" voice a lot. I had problem getting into taking care of my hygene needs. Or keeping up with them. I can hold a conversation pretty well most times. But I do mix and match words and slur words and things sometimes with no provocation. Once they thought I had a stroke, but they couldnt detect one. So it was that bad once. The neurologist had “never seen any th thing like it before"". And I'd expect he eouldnt have. Psychiatrist, psychologist, might not have seen something like that before. My brain couldnt cooperate with my mouth. I could describe the pictures with one word in succession at a time. And this was upon forcing me. This was a horrible time. I was scared I was going to be in this weird vegetable state. **spoiler** I didnt. Thank God. But I can relate to the guy trapped in his own body for several years, only I spent maybe 24 hours not even… it was terrifying.
Back to schizophrenia. I was hallucinating or seeing things up to 18, and 20 times a day. I hid it well. Mostly because I knew they weren't real. Not as sure how I **knew** because they weren't always see through or anything. But usually I could turn my head and they'd be hone. Leading to some double tskes.. but atleast I knew. Voices weren't as bad. Maybe 2 to 4 times on a bad day. And they typically just called my name, not telling me to do things. Even though they had before. Why I can usually sleep through a hippie drum circle partying ho in ng on, but until my name is called, I wont wake up. I hear my name, and I'm up. I've had whole conversations in my sleep before. Weirded out my brother bad.
My dellusions differed depending on the time. Sometimes I thought I could read minds. Sometimes they could read mine. But still not really paranoid about it. More curious to prove myself wrong. And typically did. So they never really stuck.
I have a substance use disorder that I used marajuana as well. Once I almost burned the heck out of myself because bh I felt, and KNEW there was a spider on me. Even though I had just proven I had no spider on me. Pretty sure smoking the weed made me stop myself from burning myself. Well.. maybe not. Come to think about it.. I was stuck in a loop recently. And alm ol st smashed my face into the dashboard of the truck. And for no reason o th her than “to reset my brain"". And then I stopped thought about it, with my fiancee next to me and thought better of it.
I have a history of self harm. Self mutilation is a better description of what I did to myself. So I prefer that term that was common years ago. I branded myself. Wi th h the head of a lighter. Popped the “burn bubble"" and scrubbed it with soap. And had to sit in front of the sink because the pain was so int ed nse I almost fainted. And the tush of adrenaline afterwards.. worth every bit of it. I cut myself with dull steak knives, broken single disposable razors, hair cutting razors… burnt myself with cigarettes. That was typical. I still have one scar that should've been stitched. I was thinking about getting them tattooed over, my scars nearly invisible to the naked eye. Except the brand and this scar that should've been stitched of course. Because I dont think they can be tattooed over.
But.. that's just a small part of what I was dealing with. Schizophrenia is much worse. Especially depend ik ng on the person. The hsllycinations are bad. People mutilated, and not “nice"" looking, and the voices arent always friendly. And th ik ngs hit the fan right at 13. When I started to get my period. Teen. Even though I've always seen things. But it got so much worse after I turned 13 and my father committed suicide due to his schizophrenia. And it's actually him doing that, has made me stronger. As I walked to his casket at thirteen, I decided that I would make vcd a pl promise. That I would never do this to my side of the family again. (My father was asrltrsnged-was just GB lad I got to go to the funeral.)",schizophrenia
304,"It's literally hell on earth. At least in my situation.
When I first developed Schizphrenia my family and friends and mental health professionals in the hospital were so cruel and did not want to be around me. They either thought I was faking it because I was lazy or they completely were cruel and mean. Maybe it's because they didn't understand.
I lost my daughter but thankfully she is with my parents so I am forever grateful.
I lost my job and had no insurance so when I did go the emergency room they treated me horribly. I went frequently only when I was so scared. I will never understand why the hospital mental health ward treated me like I was a criminal. In retrospect I think I just wanted to say “I'm sorry you are going thru this"". It never happened.
One problem I had was that I would laugh uncontrollably literally for hours and if I was around people they thought I was laughing at them.
I was literally in and out of Psychosis for 7 years and it was the loneliest, scariest most devastating time in my life.
Another thing that was terrible is that I would place back and forth for hours not being able to sit. Also had panic attacks where I could not swallow without drinking water.
I know that nobody knows unless they have been they thru it knows what Psychosis is like but I cant believe how cruel mean and uncaring people can be just because you have something you cannot control.
My last Psychosis went on for so long I had command hallucinations which caused me to act out criminally.
I was arrested for the first time at 49 years old. I would have never done such a thing in my right mind ever.
Luckily I was approved for SSDI.and was able to see a Psychiatrist and get on medication.
I have forgiven myself for the things I did and the way I acted and have forgives people for the way they treated me.",schizophrenia
305,"In most cases schizophrenia is severe and definitely interferes with thought and behavior on a day to day basis especially if not treated. While some people refuse to take medication, those who choose to do so will never have much insight and may deny they have any problem let alone schizophrenia.
I have had many relapses in my life but for the most part have been on medication continuously. When that medication doesn’t work, I cannot hold a job, go to school or do anything but listen to the voices and at times I have felt a lot of physical pain through hallucinations.
Even on a good regimen of medication, I still have obsessive or paranoid thoughts every week if not daily. I have 2 jobs, am getting a Master of Fine Arts in Bilingual Creative Writing, and can keep up with housework while taking care of 2 semi-active pugs.
I recently got married in May 2022, not possible before because of the pandemic (original date of May 2020) but I have trouble with jealous delusions sometimes and also the fear of sexual assault. These stem from the paranoid schizophrenia and I imagine it’s very difficult to marry someone like me.
I take a supplement called sarcosine and it helps with the hallucinations and delusions in addition to 2 antipsychotics Haldol and Zyprexa. I’ve gained weight, am tired all the time, and have difficulty working continuously as well as slow reaction times when driving, but the alternative is a hell on Earth.
Some schizophrenics don’t respond to medication and must be hospitalized all the time. I’m lucky that I’ve never spent more than 2 months in a hospital but once my fiance had to pay a lawyer 3000 to get me out when they wanted to put me in a state hospital in Oregon for a minimum of 6 months.
Schizophrenia is an interesting disease, but I’m kind of bored of the voices now. They tend to say the same things and more and more I find myself being social and loving the company of classmates, friends, and family. My doctor says I’m not disabled anymore. For this I’m grateful.",schizophrenia
306,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
307,"Hallucinations both audible and visual, constantly harassing you. Mood changes, and you can’t keep your thoughts together. The voices and people never leaving you alone. Not only that, you start adopting untrue beliefs. You think people can hear your thoughts, and all girls are wanting to kidnap you. You start to react on these beliefs, and try yelling at the voices to stop. Now, everyone thinks you’re crazy.",schizophrenia
308,"I really don’t know because I do not have severe schizophrenia, so I have never lived that life, making it very difficult to provide an accurate answer, but I have worked with many people who have when I worked in a then directed a house for mentally ill adults.
I think the cruelest part of the disease is that people can remember when they were not sick, as can their family members. Every case is different, but people with schizophrenia are likely to experience hallucinations or delusions. They may hear voices. If they have paranoid schizophrenia, they can feel like people are out to hurt them or kill them, and that can be terrifying. They may exhibit symptoms like apathy, lethargy, depression, withdrawal, loss of touch with reality, confusion, or mental disorganization. They may speak and make no sense (word salad) or their thoughts may wander. Their memory may be impaired, their reality testing may be broken, and they often feel lost and isolated.
I don’t know what it is like to actually feel those things, but I have to imagine from what my clients have told me that it is lonely, scary, and unrelenting. It’s like they are stuck in a deep, dark hole with no way out. They have a hard time connecting to other people, so it is hard for them to get support. It is difficult for them to sustain attention sometimes, so the support they might get from case workers, therapists or other people is limited. They feel judged and looked down upon. It is hard or impossible for them to make sense of their lives, and almost impossible to sustain any hope for the future. But again, I am really only guessing, based on what people have shared with me. I cannot imagine how difficult that life must be.
There are medications now that can help some people function better and some that can even help people to a remarkable degree, but there are also some rather serious side effects and a real downside to their use. If I had schizophrenia, I’d like to think I would want to take any medication out there, but I know many people have very strong feelings about not taking meds. All of my clients were on medication.
The one thing that should be noted is that despite television shows and media reports, people with schizophrenia, even paranoid schizophrenia (which has a more favorable outcome, btw), are no more likely to commit a crime than you or I. Some people with schizophrenia do commit crimes, and perhaps more than we realize, since many people with mental illnesses end without care and in jail, but it is more likely to be the sociopaths who are serial killers than schizophrenics, because people with schizophrenia are not usually sufficiently well organized to plan out crimes and then carry them out.",schizophrenia
309,"The short answer is it is like hell!
The longer answer is severe schizophrenia robs a person of their sanity. Some people might picture a little old lady reciting poems and walking in her sleep. The reality is more like a person hammering their head against a wall until it’s totally bloody and blaming their husband or caretaker for the blood. It is a horrible, horrible illness! People with severe schizophrenia who are off their medication cannot sit still, have a logical conversation and are afraid of anyone and anything around them. Sadly, suicide attempts are common and in some cases, homicidal tendencies are also possible.
And by the way, there is no cure.",schizophrenia
310,"Dangerous and Frightening for the person experiencing and to witness.
Some people that display extreme symptoms like Paranoid Schizophrenia can experience extreme Hallucinations and perception disruption, fearing that people and situations are trying to kill, harm or deceive them and that others are out to get them, they can misread something said harmlessly as an insult or threat and switch on you in the blink of an eye. Murderous obsession and delusional fixations, tainted by something dark ASF and certainly not A-typical. It is of another consciousness, feeds of the darkness.
I have alot of experience with Schizo spectrum people, my uncle for example.
I felt the dark twisted demons that plagued his mind and I felt the switch when he was no longer the occupant, his body and mind turned horribly dark and the energy of the room shifted to the yucky unpredictable and dangerous prickly energy I learnt to sense well, it's easy to identify the loud Schizo's.
They often talk to themselves, nonsense talk and will say freaky sentences…they get a kick out of insighting fear, you'll feel the hairs on your neck stand up and you instantly feel in danger when they flip the switch. Fond of machiavellianism, they often try to get you before you get them and enjoy following through on one of the scenarios that one of their many “friends” suggest they do to you. Unprovoked violence and rage driven by a dark source is Dangerous and Frightening for people to experience.",schizophrenia

I see people that are not there - (that’s what I’m told.) They are there.
I cannot get on public transportation - Uber, Busses, and taxis. They know something. They know something that I do not and then they look at me with that - look.
I hear people talking about me when I’m at the local store, pharmacy, and fast food restaurants. I leave. I cry. I cry, and cry some more then, I hyperventilate and many times I scream so loud it hurts my brain - inside.
I see dark milky clouds in the corners of rooms that form in to - things, people, objects, animals, plants, famous celebrities, Historical figures just to name a few.
There are people looking over, looking over - looking over my shoulder, across the street, on my phone, they are spying on me. Looking for me to screw up and falter. I won’t falter. I won’t. I cry. I cry, and cry some more then, I hyperventilate and many times I scream so loud it hurts my brain - inside. I cry.
I am suspicious of people who want to help me. I am suspicious when my wife says she loves me.
I am suspicious when a religious person says they will pray for me. Pray for me? Pray for me. Prey?
I die daily. I wish to die, daily. I pray to die daily. Prey.
I don’t want to jump in to a wall of knives, shoot myself in the brain, jump in to an on coming train, subway train, hang myself - I want a switch. I want to switch this off. I cry. I cry, and cry some more then, I hyperventilate and many times I scream so loud it hurts my brain - inside.

312,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.

313,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.
Update 15/11/14
Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
314,"I went vpback and looked at the symptoms firstly used to describe schitzophrenia. The first one was blunt emotions. This can happen when a person is in an oppressive situation and under threat . Not a mental misfunction but a reaction to abuse. This can bring about the disordered speech . In common language today the abuse has evolved into gas lighting where a person is manipulated to the extent that they will question their own sanity. Again abuse not a mental disorder. The next symptom was autism, we know that this is a brain disfunction due to maybe drugs vaccines or birth defects. Again not a mental illness. Comflicting belief systems , this also can be caused by changing of old held beliefs or abuse where a dominant person is strongly overshadowing another person's belief system. Again not a mental illness but abuse.
They have added to these symptoms but as the trend has been one of the person diagnosed being a victim of abuse in most cases. Then the conclusion is this diagnosis system for this particular mental health problem has been wrongly put together and has caused much harm.
The statistics have always stated that older women or frightened wives are the ones diagnosed with this . This again shows a bias and the trend of the mental health industry to dismiss older women without listening to them and checking out exactly what abuses they have had to endure that makes them scared of any social contact. Again not a mental disorder but an abuse situation.",schizophrenia
315,"Schizophrenia is a mental illness which can vary from mild to debilitating. Paranoid schizophrenia is easily medicated compared to the form with hallucinations.
Medication is seldom effective and patients struggle with life.
I have a friend who despite of the meds still has delusions and hallucinations. His improvement is insignificant. He doesn't feel any benefit from the therapy and is doing it only because his parents insist. Last I spoke to him he was not very adequate despite being well medicated. I am worried about what he is going to do once his parents are unable to support him anymore.
It doesn't help that the meds used to treat the illness sedate the patient, cause mental fog, bad memory, fatigue and lack of interest in life.
If the hallucinations don't destroy the person, the side effects of the meds will make his life very miserable.
On top of it schizophrenia can cause depression so it just keeps on giving.
But if you are lucky, the meds work and the doctor is good you can live a normal life without much difference from before. I guess you shouldn't give up until you find the right doctor. I went to England and found adequate treatment there after years of misery and now I finally live a normal life.",schizophrenia
316,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
317,"I'm terribly sorry about your mum and the impact on you and your family. Schizophrenia is a cruel brain disease, and I suspect coming to terms and adapting to the catastrophe of having a dear family member suffering from it is an ongoing challenge that changes with the severity of the condition. I think all you can do is support your mum as best you can, and do recognise that making yourself ill with the stress will make it difficult to be strong for your mum - it's not just okay, it's actually necessary to be kind to yourself, allow yourself plenty of indulgences and treats and enjoy your own life. You can't save your mum from her burden but you can be there for her if you look after you first.",schizophrenia
318,"The symptoms of Schizophrenia can vary greatly with different individuals, It's severity and duration varyingly manageable to life destroying, temporary or permanent.
However any diagnosis of schizophrenia needs to be taken very seriously and must come from a qualified doctor. A schizophrenic episode can be very dangerous to sufferer's who need proper care and observation. Even a fairly mild psychotic episode might consist of fairly banal paranoia, such as the idea of family members plotting to get them sectioned, that could lead to dangerous situations like the patient wandering off, or thinking their food is spiked even though in all other respects the person seams perfectly together.
So it's best to treat it as severe until time and treatment show otherwise. However make sure it is schizophrenia you are dealing with. If you know about abnormal psychology it's appearance can be surprisingly like simple textbook descriptions, complete with random word salads and almost comical delusions of aliens communicating via the radio. However when you realise just how consumed and frightened a person can be by these bizarre thoughts, someone who was perhaps fine and rational only days before you suddenly understand how severe a condition it is.",schizophrenia
319,"My mother is schizophrenic. I want to share my story.
Life had been difficult and it is still now. In my childhood, I've seen people treated me differently. People would mock about my mother. My adolescent mind would get hurt badly. I wondered why my mother acts so strange. It always felt like I never knew her. As a person what is she? what she likes or dislikes. I've seen other women doing makeup, dressing well. But I've never seen my mother that way. I wondered how she looks like when she dresses well. Later I found some old photographs of her when illness didn't yet attack her. I saw an woman in those photographs who is so beautiful. Her eyes on those photographs looked so charming and happy. Will I ever be able to know that person?
I've seen my mother rebuking my father without any apparent reason. She is in her delusions, a kind of false perception of reality. Its hard to connect with such kind of person. Even hard to love. But I've seen my father loved her unconditionally and without any complain, she is the woman of our family.
Yes, family life was a total mess with mommy can't do her co-ordination properly. People would generally avoid visiting our home. My mother didn't tolerate other people to come to our home. Her delusions would get kicked on those moments. She thought, those people coming to our home are her enemy. We became socially isolated. It was hard to maintain social life. Well-wishers found it difficult to help us. People would have happy family days on festivals, we would have nothing left. I've passed so many gloomy days.
In the beginning of her illness, there were so many superstitious speculations. My grandmother thought, some evil spirit had possessed her daughter. She tried every kind exorcism to evict the spirit. It was all horrible to watch those rituals. As expected, all gone in vain. Later my mother was hospitalized as a mental patient. The correct treatment started there. Since then she is under prescribed medication. It will continue throughout her life.
It's hard to live with a schizophrenic person. It's not hundred percent curable. Constant care and continuous medication is necessary. Someone near him/her must act as a 24/7 caregiver. An immense stress which sometimes makes life harder.",schizophrenia
320,"As one living with schizophrenia, I can tell you it is a lonely life. I tend to isolate a lot so I am certain when I go into hallucination mode that I am really having hallucinations and I am not hearing ""real"" voices or seeing things (like rats climbing the walls).
I know isolating isn't the answer, and I give every effort to have a social life. For example, two months ago I went to see a real movie for the first time in 35 years. I had an understanding friend with me, and that made all the difference. It's just something about being in an enclosed space with lots of people in almost total darkness.
I have been in therapy for most of my life, and am taking medications as prescribed. I have finally found a great therapist and excellent psychiatrist who have saved my life several times over.
With that background info, to more directly answer your question as to the complications of schizophrenia would include:
Financial ruin (I have been bankrupt three times);
Social awkwardness to the point of having only one or two friends at any time. both of whom understand my condition as best they can; and
A very short life span. I am not expected to live past 60 years of age, because current medications are so toxic if taken long enough.",schizophrenia
321,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
322,"Any schizophrenia - mild, moderate or severe - is treatable.
There is a global functioning scale - a questionnaire, that many mental health care professionals use.
The basic issue is quality of life, and these are measures many researchers, authors, etc seem to consider:
How many emergency and non-emergency hospitalizations the person has had (hospitalizations are also often used by studies to evaluate recovery)
If the person has gotten into legal or financial trouble or had to go to jail because of the illness
If the illness prevents the person from maintaining relationships or socializing
How much the person’s activities of daily living and what he wants to accomplish, are disrupted
How much cognition is affected
How well or completely the person’s symptoms respond to medication and other treatments
If the person needs multiple medications
How much insight the person has about his illness
If a developmental disorder(autism or intellectual disability) or other mental illness is also present
From what I’ve seen, many people have ‘mild to moderate’ schizophrenia - research says fully 65% of schizophrenia cases are ‘mild to moderate.’ But even mild to moderate schizophrenia can disrupt a person’s life a lot.
What I’ve seen is that people who are more severely ill 1.) have their lives more disrupted 2.) are more likely to get involved with substance abuse or alcohol 3.) are less likely to maintain insight about their illness 4.) are more likely to become homeless 5.) are more likely to have physical/medical health problems and poor nutrition.
Schizophrenia seems to be more disruptive when the person has a developmental disorder or other mental illness or disability.",schizophrenia
323,"Psychiatric medicine never cures schizophrenia. Psychiatrists think it is a permanent condition and do their best to make it so. In the 1950s, before psych drugs existed, two Canadian psychiatrists named Dr Hoffer and Osmond, discovered how to actually cure schizophrenia, with large doses of Niacin (vitamin B3) and vitamin C. Even without any treatment at all, 1/3 recovered spontaneously and never had another episode. Another third recovered but had occasional recurrences. Another third did not recover on their own but could be controlled with Niacin and vitamin C. This was the beginning of orthomolecular psychiatry. I practiced orthomolecular psychiatry for 30 years - treating mental illness with nutrition, after testing for nutritional deficiencies and toxicities. At the Princeton Bio center, we got thousands of people off of psych drugs, or prevented them from starting in the first place. That institution no longer exists, but doctors like Kelly Brogan are continuing this work. For more information, see her books, or Natural Medicine, by Bonnie Camo MD.",schizophrenia
324,"No.
You are asking something like can anger be cured. Some people are more prone to anger than others, so with schizophrenia. Anger can't be cured it can only be controlled by discipline in mind, same with schizophrenia, really they are similar.
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005. Before that I was abused in school and by family members which caused the onset. Besides I wasn't sleeping well to prepare for some very tough exam. So I slowly developed the symptoms. I started thinking and believing strange things. I was given lot of medicines, really overdosed. I used to sleep all day due to them. Still my symptoms were only suppressed but the thinking didn't go. I had auditory hallucinations.
One day I was taken to another psychiatrist who took a big book from her shelf and read to me about the disease called schizophrenia. It was an aha(!) moment for me. lol. Ooooh so this is what its all about! Still continuing medication. Total 5 years of medication and lot of severe side effects, I decided I will quit the medicines. Against my doctor and parents I quit them in 2010. Now till 2013 I havent visited any mental health doctor or taken any medicine. Only things needed are really good sleep at night, no coffee , no tea and no addictions, less loud music probably none and lot of meditation.
Mindfulness meditation did the trick for me. I have been meditating from my childhood and it was beneficial for me. Right now I don't get hallucinations, in fact I have gone beyond that, I can slow down and stop my own chatter in head. I also understood most of the things that the people with schizophrenia say are to prove that they don't have schizophrenia. For example, demons , aliens, God or other things are to prove that such entities are causing such strange events like hearing sounds and not the disease. At the very onset of the thought we people are aware that its imagination but after some more imagination they look real. So the idea is to be mindful of our thoughts and cut such potentially imaginable thought at its onset.
I have accepted myself the way I am and I am very very happy, I have a very good job (really good ;) ) and when I understand someone and if needed I tell him about my problem sincerely. It really creates a social support for you. We humans are after all to love each other.",schizophrenia
325,"From what I have gathered there isn't really a one size fits all cure. It takea a lot of hard work. Kean perception and spiritual discipline. There will never be a magic pill.
A lot of it is just maintaining a positive attitude when you're life is continuously being destroyed. Enduring hardship and acceptance of suffering until, if ever, you recover. You really need to be grateful for the small things. Grow thick skin.
Personly I'm constantly being attacked by evil spirits. I know that I am. Unfortunately the world doesn't see it that way.

326,"I was healed and not cured by holistic help. People are as sick as they want. I did not let the label of mental illness stop me from growing pass that label into sanity. My book, “Paradigm Busters, Reveal the Real You” describes chapter by chapter how I let the past harms go to move into maturity, sanity, and the moment which is a gift. That is why it is called The Present.
I left the hell behind. I had to get off all the prescriptions to made rational decisions, find healthy behaviors and thinking, let go of the past harms, and learn to help others while being as honest with myself as I could be.
When I read, “People of the Lie” by Dr. Scott Peck, I vowed to be as hones with myself as I could possibly be, as I did not want to be paranoid schizophrenic like my mother.

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

328,"No, not untill epicenetics research takes place which alters gene expression in the brain which causes schizophrenia.
thing is schizophrenic is an umbrella term for multiple things going on in the brain. Its not just one illness in my opinion, the brain structures keep varying with different types of schizophrenia and i think schizophrenia is basically a generalized term based on similar symptoms of hallucinations. However, brain structures are too varied.
we know for a fact, if brain structures are defective, no medication, psychotherapy will cure it. But genes identified if altered can reverse it. This technology has been used in lung deseases as well. It has worked. But the road is long and ardeous and funding is necessary.",schizophrenia
329,"Oh yes, please be assured that is the case. Just the other day I was reading research (on recovery from psychosis) which said that 67% people recover completely from it. Of course that research was from the US, and I am not sure this would be any but their statistics. But the reality is that many recover in every part of the world.
My own phd is focused on recovery from psychosis (which happens in both schizophrenia and bipolar). I personally know at least a few who have recovered from schizophrenia right here in India itself.
And in case you did not know, John Nash recovered and did not take any medication for at least 25 years of his life. So be assured it is nothing extraordinary, but a matter of dedication and discipline…a majority can recover. But it does not happen by putting psychiatry as the leader of one’s life.

And be civil around my enemies. I’ve learned how to set boundaries around people. However, I’ve stopped going to church. It’s because I’ve been shunned by everyone in 5 different churches.

331,"Current modern science view is very limited. It rejects self observation through mind as a valid tool to verify truths. It is also not patient centric so what patients experience is not trusted.
Scientists are not working on curing or solving for schizophrenia. They think they have solved it. Only a bunch of psychiatrists or psychologists who already believe they know about schizophrenia are publishing papers on the disorder. The papers are very biased towards inferences they want- which is to look at schizophrenia as a brain disorder that originates inside the human mind due to chemical imbalance- a very tunnel view. Many other papers that publish other views on schizophrenia are not encouraged or pursued. The only thing that can drive a new direction in research is if schizophrenia spreads over time to such an extent that finding a solution would become imperative. When psychiatry fails other views will become important.
Schizophrenia needs a metaphysical view-telecommunications experts, physicists, mindfulness experts and others who have a balanced view towards the world to pick up each symptom and investigate it. For example for hearing voices they should check if voices are being transmitted from outside somewhere or getting generated inside the mind. People know very little about how voice travels in space- only physicists and telecom engineers know this- psychiatrists are not able to have a “vibrations” based view of the world, they think everything is body. In Buddhist meditation community it is common knowledge that advanced meditators or teachers can read others’ thoughts or check their vibrations. This kind of subtle knowledge does not exist in psychiatry. Scientific research can start with looking at the hearing voices problem for example as a telecommunications signaling problem. Thought detection has been done in scientific research (by MIT) to solve for another medical issue so it should be applied to schizophrenia but the psychiatrists are not approaching it like this. They have too much trust in their own rudimentary theories and medications. And these days allopathy is moving away from the concept of “curing illnesses” to “patchwork” of taking medication for life solutions- very lucrative to doctors. So schizophrenia is not getting cured anytime soon!",schizophrenia
332,"Good question—-very tough question.
You could fill a large library with all the books, research reports, etc. that have been written on schizophrenia. It ranks with consciousness as one of the great medical/psychological/science problems. When I started teaching college, there were 15 major theories of causation in schizophrenia. Today there are less than 1/2 dozen, but we remain a long ways from completely understanding the cause(s), developing prevention, and effective treatment for this devastating disorder. It is probable that schizophrenia is not one disorder, but a family of disorders. One problem is that ther range of symptoms possible in the disorder is vast and overlapping with other disorders. There is clearly brain damage in the disorder of specific and potentially diffuse sorts. The longer one is ill and ineffectively treated, the more damage there is. With current drugs and treatment, the best we hope for is getting someone into remission as quickly as possible. The “rule of thirds” holds. One third will after an episode,if treated aggressively, go into remission and stay there, with no major damage to their psyche. One third will move in and out of remission across the lifetime, often showing residual symptoms in between major exacerbations. One third will become ill, become progressively so, being resistant to treatment, and need care for the rest of their life. Bottom line at this moment—there is no clear outlook for a cure. New brain imaging techniques, understandings of neurochemistry, gene/environment interactions, and breakthroughs in medication and other treatments will be needed most likely.",schizophrenia
333,"See if you look at anti psychotic medication sales year over year you realize then no insensitive for anything but treatment. If there was they would probably spend money to suppress a cure. That's probably the biggest reason I kinda do my own thing yes I look and listen to all the science so they are important to my process but management of symptoms and doing the things I need to do is my responsibility (note I'm not taking care of my self now dite cardio schedule) kinda in some heavy anhidonia.
Not one time I went to a doctor to tell him my blood type changed it was O it became A . I showed my birth certificate showed my last blood work. He said it was impossible and must be a clarical error. So I told him what is impossible my body can't make a protein? He look at me weird but blow me off
So my experience with doctors intrist to look in to or adapting to the idea that biology can vary in persons with development issues.
Which leads me to the aproch schizophrenia is a compound illness that has sencery prossing and development disorder under tones comparable to autism. Schizophrenia occurs when brain development ends . So when I see schizophrenia as a development issues sencery prossing issues and because some people get a hold of there schizophrenia after 10 year and the whole vascular/respatory system.. see different system have different turn over rates and because schizophrenia is a degenerative illness if you wanna cure it you need to adopt regeneration selected practices.. a pill a day doesn't do that routines , better stress management diet reinforcing microbiomes brain and gut . Thats how you drive a conclusion to developmental issues. Adaptations to environmental pressures are what R Vs K selection was all about microbiome significantly influence behavioral expression and back when R vs K selection they did not understand that behavioral expression was a adaptation mechanism. So if you want to change your development disorders find a financial stable or lifestyle nechi develop a routine optimize your routine to help your nerves system organs endocrin system and you'll actually get better.
My biggest moments with schizophrenic understand sensory system are in a fold or on the surface of the cortex. This means that pressure variations would have physical impact of sencery or sencery storage or prossing systems pressure current in the brain which is a pressurized system.. that important because we have vascular system abnormalities to are ventricles are bigger so the flow rate can increase. All physics and chemistry people know pressure changes everything.
Now because consciousness is a kinda state of mind wave most people that understand brain waves know there's a (alfa bata Gama thata ) wave patterns and all have different effects on the optimization undline function wether your sleeping or meditatiaing learning or being creative brain wave activity is a indicator of what system is essentially operating. So again if you have schizophrenia it's your brain needs to recover so adopting meditation breath work or non sleep deep rest protacals will help regulate your cognitive fatigue and stables decoharnt wave patterns.
So see science has all the answers to helping schizophrenia treatment however the approach and application to schizophrenia recover is not there
And it's up to schizophrenics to find are own way because the systems is not designed to help just exploit so.",schizophrenia
334,"I'm not sure their current ideas of what constitutes schizophrenia can entirely be cured. Seems to be behaviour and I don't understand how a behaviour is cured. Though measures can tell what a behaviour does within the body, the difference doesn't guarantee illness. A behaviour might be misunderstood then diagnosed as illness. What constitutes imagination and how to communicate it to another being? I think people are able to visualize but do not have a way to communicate how they are seeing what they do. They are said to have hallucinations but perhaps they are using a different part of their brain or a same part in a different way. Wouldn't this be apparent in any measure? I think people sometimes are more narcissistic than they are schizophrenic. To imagine people are always judging them or people are up to something seems to reflect as self importance rather than paranoia. “Will scientists cure schizophrenia?” depends on how they perceive behaviour. They may continue on with treating patients in the ways they do and this may lead to what they call a cure. I don't know that their solution will have cured anything. Perhaps there is more of a cure through introspection and patience. Giving oneself time to make decisions and time to make decisions about what has been done; especially with any choices that people have disagreed with is an appropriate measure to begin understanding oneself and what has been described as symptomatic.",schizophrenia

336,"Original qestion: Will there ever be a cure to schizophrenia? Why?
Answer updated December 2018. Much current research seems to focus on enhancing NMDA receptor function, but D1 dopamine receptor activation (which naturally modulates NMDA receptors) is also possible - see last 4 paragraphs.
A general cure for schizophrenia is one of the outstanding medical needs of our age, considering that schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (the milder but still disabling condition) together affect about 1% of people worldwide. What does the future hold for those diagnosed with schizophrenia? A life in which the medication they take to control the ""positive"" symptoms - hearing voices and other hallucinations affecting all the senses - will not help much (and may hinder) with their struggle against the ""negative"" symptoms - difficulties in reasoning, motivation and the ability to feel pleasure. Recent research confirms the importance of treating these: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia linked to poor clinical outcomes.
It would be easy to condemn the pharmaceutical industry as being lazy in their efforts to find a cure, but medication has improved since the first generation of antipsychotics (phenothiazines, e.g. chlorpromazine), and the latest drugs have reduced side-effects. To accurately predict the action of future drugs will require an almost god-like combination of data and computing power, which we haven't yet reached, but there are international efforts underway, see Megabucks pouring into global brain science projects. We are probably decades away from achieving a good brain simulation in silico, but the data we already have is yielding important insights.
There is now a large body of research that bolsters the glutamate receptor hypothesis, which explains the different symptoms of schizophrenia as originating from NMDA receptor dysregulation. I haven't done a rigorous meta-analysis but reading schizophrenia research shows a clear trend. To sum up theories since the 1950's, there was early focus on the neurotransmitter serotonin, suggested by the hallucinogenic effects of the serotonin agonist LSD, but this was soon discounted because LSD produces mainly visual effects (by agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor), with little of the auditory hallucinations or paranoid/delusional thinking typical of schizophrenia.
Next came the dopamine theory, suggested by the observation that amphetamine psychosis (caused by excessive release of dopamine) closely mirrors schizophrenia, including the auditory/visual hallucinations and paranoia, but with significantly less cognitive impairment. Overactive D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) circuits in the basal ganglia and limbic system are strongly associated with schizophrenic symptoms, but this still isn't the whole story as it doesn't explain underactivity in the prefrontal cortex and the fact that 5-HT2A/D2DR antagonists are only partly effective as treatment.
Finally, the glutamate hypothesis suggested around 1987 has become the dominant theory as more evidence is found, [1] both from observation of the very close mimicry of schizophrenia caused by NMDA (the main glutamate receptor) antagonists like ketamine and especially phencyclidine (PCP), and also from genetic studies implicating the NMDA receptor, as well as other receptors interacting directly with NMDA like GABA, and enzyme pathways converging on these receptors. For example, this genetic study - ""Novel Findings from CNVs Implicate Inhibitory and Excitatory Signaling Complexes in Schizophrenia"" (Page on cell.com) - finds evidence for disruption of GABA and NMDA receptors, and also ARC protein (crucial for NMDA circuits enabling learning and synaptic plasticity). See links in Refs section below for video by 2 leading researchers explaining in technical terms cognitive dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and possible treatments.[4,5]
These 3 theories - disruption of normal function at NMDA/D2/5-HT2A receptors - are not mutually exclusive, and together explain impaired cognition in the prefrontal cortex, hyperactivity in the basal ganglia, and sensory hallucinations. The origin of hypo-(and sometimes hyper-) activity in the prefrontal cortex has been linked with excessive spine pruning in the second and third decades of life, and research in 2016 found this could result from over-expression of the C4A gene, part of the innate immune system.[7] Another study finds a connection with the Arp2/3 gene: Scientists Reconcile Three Unrelated Theories of Schizophrenia (full paper: Page on nature.com) - and creates a realistic knockout mouse model, though it should be noted that species differences between mice and humans, not least in the amino acid sequences of brain receptors, may limit its usefulness in testing new drugs. It is likely that many different mutations can result in schizophrenia, suggesting that gene therapy may one day provide the ultimate cure, provided that the condition is identified early enough. Meanwhile can we do anything to alleviate symptoms via easier-to-reach receptors in the adolescent or adult brain?
To recap: current drugs are more or less successful in relieving positive symptoms by reducing D2 and 5-HT2A activity, but is there anything in the pipeline to treat flat emotions and cognition?
Looking at the publicly available information in November 2015 from the world's top 25 drug companies, 7 were working on schizophrenia: Pfizer, Roche, Johnson & Johnson (as parent company of Janssen), Abbvie, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Lundbeck. Of these, all except Amgen and Lundbeck explicitly state that their research is focussed on treatment of negative/cognitive symptoms, which has to be good news! See also this 2015 summary of drugs in development.[6]
One attractive target is the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, which contains 4 subunits of which 2 are NR2. NR2B predominates in the postnatal brain, and enables rapid learning by keeping the receptor channel open to the movement of cations longer than the NR2A subunit. Essentially it makes the neuron more excitable. NR2A displaces NR2B over time, which partly explains reduced learning capacity (synaptic plasticity) in older individuals. This ""NR2B-NR2A switch"" has been reversed in ""doogie"" mice by genetically engineering them to over-express the NR2B gene (Page on scq.ubc.ca), and researchers hope to duplicate this effect to improve cognition in schizophrenia with an NR2B positive allosteric modulator (NR2B-PAM). A positive allosteric modulator [2] changes a receptor by binding to it at a location other than the normal binding site, so the neurotransmitter that normally binds to it can still do its thing, but with greater efficacy. In this way researchers hope to emulate the safety profile of another class of allosteric modulators, benzodiazepines, which are far less toxic than the barbiturates they replaced. This approach is essential as glutamatergic neurons are very susceptible to excitotoxicity, leading to cell death after stroke or in neurodegenerative diseases.
Cadent Therapeutics is actively researching NR2B PAMs. In a similar approach, a metabotropic glutamate receptor is being targeted by the mGluR2 PAM ADX-71149, in Phase II trials as of 2015.
Another NMDA PAM currently being trialled is Rapastinel (GLYX-13), see my answer to Will glyx 13 work for positive symptoms of schizophrenia?
In the near future there is a promising new drug, Pimavanserin, which when given with other antipsychotics like haloperidol or risperidone, has been found to reduce side-effects, however regulatory approval has so far only been given for treatment of Parkinson’s disease psychosis.
A drug that mimics the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (i.e. effective against positive symptoms) has recently been identified: A novel aminotetralin-type serotonin (5-HT) 2C receptor-specific agonist and 5-HT2A competitive antagonist/5-HT2B inverse agonist with preclinical efficacy for psychoses. It seems likely that it would be much safer, avoiding the potentially fatal agranulocytosis and the 5% risk of the permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia.
Another new target for drugs is the alpha7 nicotinic receptor, as it is underactive in schizophrenia (which is why many sufferers smoke) and specific agonists enhance prefrontal cortex function and increase PFC dopamine, with some already showing promising results in clinical trials.[3, 5] These drugs can alleviate symptoms with a much longer action than nicotine, and without the health dangers of smoking.
Another strategy for drug design is to exploit other receptors which naturally modulate glutamate circuits, e.g. D1 dopamine receptors, see my answer to Can selective D1 dopamine agonists (like Dihydrexidine) be useful for schizophrenia?. Surprisingly, Pfizer has defied the conventional wisdom on D1 dopamine agonists by developing a whole library of non-catechol agonists which cleverly exploit greater hydrogen bonding with Serine 188 in extracellular loop 2 of the receptor. These are documented in 2014 and 2015 patents – WO2014072881, WO2014207601 and WO2015162515.
A new study published in Nature (Impaired β-arrestin recruitment and reduced desensitization by non-catechol agonists of the D1 dopamine receptor - Gray et al (2018)) reveals that one of these Pfizer agonists, PF-2334, has been selected as an ideal drug candidate. It is orally active and slowly metabolised, with a high D1R affinity (20nm) and gives 104% of the cAMP response of dopamine, together with a very low risk of receptor downregulation via β-arrestin. I will update this answer when results of human testing are published.
New drug candidates in a similar class of compounds, D1R PAMs (D1 dopamine Receptor Positive Allosteric Modulators), have recently been identified. This summarises why D1R PAMs might be more effective than D1 DA agonists in treating cognitive problems [8]:
“… cognitive impairment in disease states has been associated with low levels of D1R activity in the prefrontal cortex; however, too much D1R stimulation (e.g., associated with stress) can lead to decreased cognition (an inverted U relationship) (Goldman-Rakic et al., 2004; Arnsten and Dudley, 2005; Arnsten and Li, 2005; Vijayraghavan et al., 2007). Thus, the desired attribute for a procognitive therapeutic might be one that will moderately potentiate D1R activity without producing an overshoot that could result in decreased cognition. Further experiments in animals, and eventually in man, will be required to fully test this hypothesis.”
Research published in 2017 [9] and 2018 [10] reveals that 2 of these - LY3154207 and DETQ - show promise in treating Parkinson’s Disease dementia and other cognitive impairment.
“… these results provide support for potential utility of D1 potentiators in the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, and major depressive disorder.”

338,"Because treatment for any mental illness is not perfect. You will take medications that won't work for years until you find one that does. You will spend the rest of your life taking those medications, and talking to a therapist all while just trying to be “normal”. You will want to be able to work, date, and have a family. But for too many with mental health issues that's not how it goes. Let alone someone with schizophrenia who is convinced medication is not a solution and won't do anything to do better to get to “normal”.

Not one bleeding into months of the same bs symptoms everyday. I will struggle with this everyday, for everyday of my life. You don't “shut it off” or “stop it”. That's not what mental health issues are. It means in the best times of your life, you only feel suffering. And the worst of times? Someone without, can only judge you.

Things im learning to do:
Laugh around people (everyone loves a good Hoyas person) be slow to judge other, be nice, budget my bills out first when I get paid then hit the clearance racks, go on adventures, be kinds to my mom and go above and beyond for my pup.",schizophrenia
343,"I would say that “normal” doesn’t really exist, but I guess I know what you mean.
A person with schizophrenia can lead a life that is fulfilling. They might also live a life that is “normal” I suppose. It depends on the person really. If by “normal” you mean working 40+ hours a week at a job, having a spouse and children, and participating in life in a sort of “normal” way…yes I guess it is possible, but I would say that for most people who have schizophrenia there would be some kind of alternative formation of what is “normal.”
You have to remember that having schizophrenia still means that you are living with a disability, so the disability has to be managed in some way. Most people who have schizophrenia will need to be stabilized on medications in order to lead a “normal”-ish life, so that in itself is a bit not “normal.” In the US that means that someone with schizophrenia will have to have access to medical care usually through some kind of health insurance. In the US that means you need to either have a job with medical coverage, you need to be wealthy, or you need to be on something like disability and receiving government health coverage in some way. So, let’s say someone is more “normal” and they have a regular job that provides health insurance. Not only will the job be stressful, but there will be stress from having to worry about if they lose the job that they will lose insurance and lose medical coverage which provides medications that keep them sane. In essence, there’s kind of a lot riding on the job with medical insurance, and it adds a lot of stress. But what is bad for schizophrenia symptoms? Stress.
Then I guess you want to add on the stress of having a nuclear family if we are aiming for “normal.” A woman who has schizophrenia can have children, but there will definitely be added dimensions to any pregnancy, because she’d need to either go off all medications or still be on meds which can be a risk too. But let’s just say the kids have already been born. As any parent can tell you, raising children is still stressful and expensive. People with schizophrenia are often not employed or are marginally employed. I would say that they often are discriminated against in employment although I don’t have numbers to back this up. So, they will likely have less money than “normal” peers unless they are wealthy through inheritance. But we were going with the regular job and regular kids and regular spouse and everything.
I guess the odds of a person with schizophrenia having a completely “normal”, average, uneventful life are slim. Most people without schizophrenia don’t have “normal” jobs and “normal” kids and “normal” marriages and “normal” everything, although there are some people who do. Having schizophrenia means you will likely have more stress and less money. At the same time, stress can trigger symptoms. “Normal” people have trouble finding compatible spouses, so you add the dimension of having a really stigmatized illness to that, and you’ll find that the dating pool drops significantly. “Normal” people sometimes have kids with special needs, so that could happen to a person with schizophrenia too.
So, I would say that the statistical odds of anyone having a “normal” life are low. The odds of someone with schizophrenia having a completely “normal” life are much lower. But there is a HUGE difference between “normal” and having a good and fulfilling life.
In society we tend to judge people as having achieved a good life if they have a good job, if they have a successful, “normal” family life. But there are many many other ways to have a good life. I would say that “normal” shouldn’t even be the goalpost. “Normal” is like the mean number when you are measuring something. Sometimes even if you measure something and there is a mean number there might actually be no data that hits exactly on the mean number. Normal is like this. Sometimes people hit the mean, but a lot of times they don’t, so “normal” is just this idea we have out there about what is “normal” meanwhile no one is living a “normal” life.

345,"Schizophrenia is about ‘misspellings’ in genes - genes all of us have. Schizophrenia is nothing like those genes you studied in high school, that pass on a ‘trait’ like blue eyes. This is a whole different ballgame.
If a person has schizophrenia, he has multiple ‘misspellings’ in multiple gene locations. If schizophrenia is severe the misspellings are larger and more numerous. If schizophrenia is mild, the misspellings are smaller and less numerous.
That it is MULTIPLE gene locations, explains a lot. It explains why the ‘inheritance rate’ is so LOW - if your mom has schizophrenia, statistically, you have only a 14% lifetime adjusted risk of schizophrenia. That’s because it requires multiple genes to ‘misspell’ a certain way. Imagine having multiple coins, and flipping them all, and looking for them to turn up heads, tails, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, heads. You’d be flipping your coins for a while to get that combination. That’s why inheritance is generally low.
You could, however, have something called ‘family loading.’ Close relatives having multiple different related disorders - bipolar, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, autism, severe depression. There are some gene locations common to all of these. Distant relatives don’t add much risk of you having any of these illnesses, but close relatives do add substantial risk.
SOME of these misspellings MAY be passed down from parent to child. For this aspect of the illness, forget everything you know about ‘recessive’ genes and ‘dominant’ genes, each gene passing on a ‘trait.’ This is very unlike that. These are misspellings in genes all of us have. And in fact they are so small that many genetic tests you can buy today, don’t even look for them.
Further, these misspellings can be unique to one person. And still bring about schizophrenia. And since there are so many candidate gene locations (over a hundred), that no two peoples’ schizophrenia is likely to be ‘exactly alike.’
These misspellings often arise in individuals, without being inherited. Why? It seems to be random events, genes misspell all the time, though some genes in some locations are more liable to getting messed up, certain locations seem to be more at risk because of how dna coils up and turns.
Many times genes misspell and it hurts nothing. Not so in schizophrenia.
There is some serious investigation going on of chromium, that supplementing it in reasonable amounts MIGHT stop some of the gene misspellings. We don’t know yet whether that’s going to pan out. I am sure some people will jump to conclusions even now, and start gulping down huge amounts of chromium supplements - that’s not at all a good idea. As noted, we really don’t know yet.
Sometimes there is a very small misspelling that is inherited, and then the individual’s genetic material makes, by itself, a bigger misspelling ontop of that. It’s up to you whether you think that’s ‘inheritance’ or not. I wouldn’t say it was.
There are about a hundred genes that could be involved, but about a dozen genes are seen very often and might be said to convey a sort of ‘core risk.’ A few of them are ‘general risk’ genes that are found in many different conditions, such as severe depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and autism.
We can now draw a straight line from gene location to substance the gene ‘codes for,’ to cognitive symptom, to symptom of schizophrenia.
In fact, autism and schizophrenia often involve the same gene locations, but the misspellings are somewhat different. In schizophrenia, the misspellings tend to be mixed up letters, where in autism, the letters are actually missing(‘deletions’).
These genes control the grown and development of the brain before birth, they are ‘code’ for various proteins/enzymes that are involved in fetal brain growth. So in early development before birth, small errors in the brain development are made, and then are later ‘uncovered’ when the brain undergoes rapid change and ‘rewiring,’ usually at age 18–21 for men, usually somewhat later for women.
The human brain normally undergoes rapid ‘rewiring’ and change at several different ages - about 1 1/2, about 7–8, about 13–14, and 18–21. Schizophrenia can onset at any of those ages.
At that key point, later in life, whether it’s in childhood or early adulthood, the brain has a system of ‘scavengers’ that look for brain cells that are ‘off’ - getting too many messages, or too few, and - disassembles them. This happens very rapidly, and notably, without inflammation or scarring. The cells just disappear.
Why? Because this ‘pruning’ is a natural, ‘normal’ process. It’s supposed to happen. In fact, it turns out that humans get a much smarter, more flexible brain, by starting out with lots of brain connections and extra cells, and ‘pruning’ them. That’s how our brains develop. Going from many connections and extra cells, to slightly fewer connections and slightly fewer cells. A newborn baby’s brain lights up like a Christmas tree, all over. It’s meant to. By the time we’re adults we’ve gone through waves of ‘tuning’ that brain.
But with schizophrenia, too many cells are identified for the ‘cleanup’ processes. THIS part of the illness happens extremely rapidly - UCLA researchers watched it happen in 3–6 weeks.
What is really astounding about schizophrenia, in fact, is that people deal with it so WELL, that despite it they remain staunchly who they are, and that we actually have fairly decent treatments.
It’s a serious illness with a ‘life cycle’ or ‘process’ that requires many years to unfold in its different stages. When you meet a person with schizophrenia you meet someone who has truly come through a storm and survived.",schizophrenia
346,"“Genetics” and “heredity” are not synonyms. These two words mean two different things.
“Genetic” means “having to do with genetic material”(which we all carry in our cells).
This genetic material in us can create its own random changes. These happen all the time, by chance, or due to genes interacting with each other. Our genetic material can be inherited from our parents, and then change, so it does not have the same patterns the parent DNA had.
In other words, let’s look at a bunch of gene locations, A, B, C, D.
At A, I have the spelling DAD, just like my dad did. At B, I have the spelling MOM, like my mom did. At C, I have the spelling that is a mix from both my parents: let’s say that one is MOD. And at D, my spelling looks nothing like either of my parents have. It has the spelling MINE.
So you see, I do not necessarily have the same spellings of either my mom or dad in the same gene locations. My spellings could be completely my own little odd pattern, at certain gene locations. You might call those a mutation. But it’s not like a Godzilla movie where there is a nuclear explosion or pollution. No, I may have my own little old mutation simply because mutations happen.
“Hereditary” means “genetic material passed down to one’s offspring.” This means actual, literal tissue, DNA, that an offspring gets from a parent, from the eggs or sperm.
So with that background let’s look at how genes cause schizophrenia.
First, there is no ‘schizophrenia gene.’ There is no one gene that only schizophrenics have. Instead, it involves multiple gene locations(locations on a gene, each of which codes for a specific protein the body needs).
The gene locations involved in schizophrenia are gene locations everyone has; they all control brain development prior to birth. But with schizophrenia, there are misspellings at those gene locations. Either because the person inherited those patterns of mispellings, or made his own mispellings himself.
What happens is that during early brain development, the brain cells are supposed to migrate to their rightful position, and hook up with other brain cells and start creating pathways(think of lots of nerve cells joining hands and cooperating together to create superhighways to connect widely separated parts of the brain). The cells actually migrate (I have a video of one and it looks like a tennis ball scooting along inside a very long sock, lol).
But what happens with schizophrenia, is because of those gene misspellings (for example, say, there is a misspelling in a gene location that codes for a molecule that STEERS those nerve cells as they migrate, or keeps them nourished) there are errors made in the growth and development of the brain.
And let’s say further that there are A DOZEN gene locations that control nerve cell migration. Well, if all 12 are misspelled, I am going to have much more severe illness. If only one is misspelled, milder illness.
People with more severe illness have more misspellings, and the misspellings they have are bigger.
So that is a very simplified overview of stage 1 of schizophrenia. And what now happens is that the person is born. And he may look just fine to family and friends at birth.
But at some point, late adolescence/young adulthood, the human brain undergoes another astounding extensive rewiring. Believe it or not, we have proven with computer simulation that by having these astounding spurts of rewiring in which many brain connections and even brain cells are lost, we wind up with a more flexible, smarter brain.
So that is something most people do not known. Your brain undergoes an amazing rewiring process just before adulthood.
It’s called pruning. This process actually removes brain cells.
What if all the body processes doing that rewiring get thrown off course? Get confused?
What in the world would possibly do that?
Remember those brain cells that migrated to the wrong spot, or didn’t make appropriate connections?
Well when pruning time comes those cells are going to get - removed. Yup. No swelling, no scarring, no nothing. THose brain cells are just gone.
So now we have step two of schizophrenia. Pruning gone wrong.
NOW…..within a few WEEKS, the person will start to ‘hear voices.’
WHY?
Because that pruning process removed brain cells from the area in the brain that processes what we hear.
A hallucination, in other words, is the brain trying to ‘fill in the blanks.’",schizophrenia
347,"The causation of schizophrenia has different components, some are genetic, other are environmental. There is therefore a mixture of nature and nurture. If you have a close relative who suffers from schizophrenia, your chances to develop it is higher than in the general population. On the other hand, even if you have an identical twin who suffers from schizophrenia, therefore exactly the same set of genes and a very similar environment in which you grew up of someone who suffers from schizophrenia, you still have 50-60% chances to not develop the condition. Therefore there is more than genes involved.",schizophrenia
348,"Yes.
Schizophrenia involves multiple genes.
So inheriting it is like flipping five coins and having them all come up ‘heads.’ So all the kids in the family don’t always get it.
But I have seen families where all the siblings had either schizophrenia, bipolar or schizoaffective (5 siblings, too).
Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective, Bipolar, Autism and Intellectual Disability all ‘share risk,’ because they can have some gene patterns in common.
If I have schizophrenia, my children are more likely to have schizophrenia.
If my partner also has schizophrenia, my offspring’s risk of schizophrenia increases by 3.5 times over the risk of having just one parent with schizophrenia.
But they’re also more likely to have bipolar, schizoaffective or autism(that’s how shared risk works).
Every time a couple conceives a child, they are throwing the ‘genetic lottery’ dice again.
Each of their offspring are not guaranteed, by any means, to have exactly the same gene patterns.
The genetic pattern of the previous child has no affect. Every time you conceive a child, you throw the dice anew.
Schizophrenia is neurodevelopmental. That means it is based in brain development that occurs prior to birth. It starts before the person is born.
There are many genes that can be involved because each aspect of prenatal brain development is directed by more than one gene.
Example, let’s say directing brain cell migration(a huge part of schizophrenia for sure) is controlled by ten genes. Let’s say it’s controlled by genes a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j.
Schizophrenic #1 has miscodings in genes a, b, c. Schizophrenic #2 has miscodings in genes g, h, and i. Schizophrenic #3 has miscodings in genes b, c, e, f, i, j. Schizophrenic 3 has more severe schizophrenia. More genes are disrupted. How large the miscoding is on an individual gene can affect the severity of schizophrenia too. Some genes have more power to affect other genes - miscodings in those genes have more impact.",schizophrenia
349,"Yes.
No.
The low inheritance rate of schizophrenia fooled some people for a long time. But it is typical of multi-gene disorders because they have multiple genes involved.
A hundred years ago, a researcher did a study. He tracked infants who were taken from their schizophrenic mothers the day they were born. His idea was that the children couldn’t possibly have ‘learned’ schizophrenia from their mothers as someone else raised them. The children were raised in wonderful homes, with healthy parents. They still got schizophrenia at the same rate as the children who stayed with their mothers.
The weird thing was not this, but that the rate those kids got schizophrenia was actually surprisingly low. As I noted, this puzzled people for a long, long time. That rate wasn’t 100%, or 50%, or even 25%.
For a long time a lot of people insisted, “Then it must be multi-factorial.’
Others said ‘wait for the genetics.’ And they kept saying that. ‘Just wait. Wait for the genetics.’
An old doctor once told me, ‘Do you know what multi-factorial’ means? It means we ain’t got no damned idea.’ He told me multi-factorial models fell away like sand on a tidal beach when the real cause became known.
Try to throw ten coins and have them all come up heads. It doesn’t happen often. The same thing happens with schizophrenia.
If you have one parent with schizophrenia, your lifetime adjusted risk is around 14%. Surprised?
Your risk for depression is higher. There a strong genetic component to some depressions, and some of the patterns are not so very different from schizophrenia gene patterns.
Watch yourself for depression. If you get it, get it treated. Right away. Medication? You betcha. Do what works(‘evidence based treatment’).
This 14% doesn’t say exactly who will get schizophrenia, all it says is ‘if I take 100 people who have one parent with schizophrenia, about 14 of them will eventually get schizophrenia.’ Without studying each parent’s genetic patterns, that’s as good an estimate as one can come up with.
When UCLA did their incredible study of schizophrenia onset, they asked 150 people ‘at risk for schizophrenia’ to participate. They were at risk because one or both of their parents had schizophrenia.
I believe about 15 people from the study did get schizophrenia(the estimate isn’t going to be exact, especially with smaller groups of people). The team took functional MRIs while the illness developed. The results of course were astounding.",schizophrenia
350,"It is often inherited. Genetic and inherited are two different words. Schizophrenia is always genetic, and often inherited.
If I got 100 people gathered in a room, and each of them had one parent with schizophrenia, I can say for sure that about 14 of them would wind up with schizophrenia.
Sounds low, doesn’t it? Well, its probably a bit off. The calculations didn’t allow for missed diagnoses, delayed diagnoses(the AVERAGE delay to diagnosis is ten years! that will screw up almost any statistic you try to calculate), misdiagnoses, or related disorders, like schizophreniform disorder(the most unstable diagnosis in psychiatry, 92% converting to schizophrenia at some point) and schizoaffective disorder.
Further, if BOTH your parents have schizophrenia, that number jumps to 50 or more.
In other words, with multi-gene disorders, you don’t generally see 100% heredity. That’s because to an extent, genes combine somewhat randomly in each offspring, meaning that getting that multi-gene disorder is basically like flipping five coins and having them all come up heads on one throw, which does not happen often.",schizophrenia
351,"Hi mate YES!
Clues to the genetic basis of schizophrenia Many studies have demonstrated that schizophrenia can run in families. The evidence that heredity plays a role in the development of some forms of schizophrenia has come from studying identical twins and other family situations. If an identical twin (monozygotic twin) develops schizophrenia, then the chance that the other twin will also develop it is 1 chance in 2 ie. 50% (see Table 58.1) This genetic involvement has been confirmed by studying identical twins who were raised separately (therefore not sharing the same environment) as well as studying adopted children of mothers with schizophrenia Risks for family members of developing schizophrenia increase with the number of affected relative
Genes Research : is continuing and some progress is being made into identifying gene(s) in which changes may increase an individual’s risk of developing schizophrenia. It is likely that several different genes are involved, perhaps causing susceptibility to different forms of schizophrenia In some families, there may be genes that have a major effect on the risk of development of schizophrenia. For example, changes in the following genes have been associated with the development of schizophrenia - A gene that contains the information for a protein called dysbindin, located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p) - A gene that contains the information for a protein linked to neurotransmitters called neuroregulin, located on the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p) - A gene that contains the information for a protein designated as G72, located on the long arm of chromosome 13 (13q) - Genes in an area on the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 (22q) It appears that there is also an increased risk for having a child affected by schizophrenia at some time in their life if their father was aged over 50 when they were born.",schizophrenia
352,"Schizophrenia has a genetic component, but not entirely, and like diabetes, is multifactorial, both genetic and environmental factors contributing.
Schizophrenia is more common in the relatives of schizophrenic patients than the general population which shows a genetic component. But even identical twins, where the genetic sharing is close to 100%, have less than 1:2 risk of developing schizophrenia and this argues for a strong environmental component.

There are currently around 10 genetic variations linked to schizophrenia. Any number of these variations can be seen in an individual. The more the number of variations a person has, the more likely are his chances of developing the disease. For example, abnormal COMT gene on chromosome 22 depletes dopamine levels in the frontolimbic brain circuits resulting in the delusions and hallucinations of schizophrenia. Chromosomes 6 and 11 have also been implicated.
Environmental factors contributing are infectious exposure during pregnancy, birth complications, stressful childhood, teenage drug use, etc. So, in a person with a genetic risk, even a few environmental factors is sufficient to manifest the disease.",schizophrenia
353,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?""

354,"Yes but it's important to know that while a person's parents may have schizophrenia it's not 100% sure that the person will have schizophrenia too. It makes u genetically vulnerable to have schizophrenia so if there are some environmental stressor, they may be exacerbated and you may develop schizophrenia but if you have a stress free life, you may also not develop schizophrenia.
Some factors that may protect you from developing the disease are: good coping techniques (like journalling), good health(exercise plays and important part here, I would suggest yoga as it helps with stress management having a well balanced diet also helps) social support (relying on your family and friends when the going gets tough)",schizophrenia
355,"Schizophrenia is most often, inherited from a parent.
Yes. Because schizophrenia is a multi-gene disorder, it doesn’t inherit at the same rates as single gene disorders. Thus one parent with schizophrenia gives a 50% risk of Depression, and a 14% risk of Schizophrenia. If both parents have schizophrenia, the risk of schizophrenia jumps to 50%. Rates with multi-gene disorders reflect the relative ‘difficulty’ of getting a bunch of genes to have the necessary coding patterns. It’s like throwing 3 dice and winding up with all 3 showing ‘heads’ on one throw.
Schizophrenia increases the risk of several genetically similar disorders as well as the example above shows.",schizophrenia
356,"Somewhat.
If there is schizophrenia running in the family, there is a much higher risk of getting that metal illness.
Though there are other factors that needs to be there too.
The Stress Vulnerability Model [1]is a good way to explain why mental disorders appear in some people but not in others.
The explanation is that the mind/brain needs a certain level of stress for a mental disorder to activate.
But several factors increase the vulnerability, so less stress is needed to activate the disorder.
Inheritance or biologic vulnerability, are one of the vulnerability factors that will slide people at least half way along the vulnerability scale, and thereby half as much stress might trigger the disorder[2].
Remember in medical science stress does not mean that you feel swamped at work. It can mean physical or mental trauma, history of abuse and tragic events that generally stress your brain.

357,"YES.
In most cases Schizophrenia is an inherited disorder. Schizophrenia can be a debilitating condition that if left untreated can cause a person to literally become non functional.
Schizophrenia must be addressed and treated. A Psychiatrist can treat Schizophrenia with medication and therapy treatment. This disorder can cause erratic behavior, paranoia, social dysfunction, violent behavior and other serious symptoms. Many times Schizophrenic patients have problems with the law. Many get into legal hot water if they stop taking their medication for even one day.
This condition may cause the person to imagine that friends and family are plotting against them to cause them harm. Therefore, violent behavior on part of the Schizophrenic can result. A Schizophrenic patient may attack a perfect stranger or friend thinking they are going to harm them. Thus resulting in legal action on part of the injured party.
Schizophrenia is genetic. This disorder appears to effect the portion of the brain which controls hunger, emotions, behavior patterns and coordination. Anti Psychotic drugs are commonly prescribed to treat Schizophrenia. Therapy can prove to be of great value in Schizophrenic patients.
If one parent suffered with Schizophrenia then there is about a 50/50 chance their offspring could inherit the disorder. Therefore, the likelihood of one of their children inheriting this disorder are quite high. Drugs such as Thorazine and Stelazine are used to treat Schizophrenia.

The answer is it is both. There are certain predispositional factors and each person has varying degrees of these. For those with more factors or higher degrees, stressors will be more likely to result in symptoms. Without the stressors, the symptoms may never manifest.",schizophrenia
359,"It’s not quite that simple.
For one, schizophrenia involves ‘misspellings’ at many different gene locations, not just one or two gene locations.
So when it does inherit, it inherits like all other multi-gene disorders - the ‘heritability rate’ is low. So, if a person has one parent with schizophrenia, his or her ‘lifetime adjusted risk’ is about 14%. Not 50%, not 100%.
That’s basically because you have to have more gene locations ‘spelled that way.’ It’s much like the difference between having one two sided coin, and having a dozen 5 sided coins. Getting a dozen 5 sided coins to all land a certain way is ‘harder’ than getting one coin with two sides to land a certain way.
And sometimes those are misspellings that were inherited, and sometimes they are not.
The misspellings can be inherited from a parent, or they can arise ‘spontaneously,’ I suppose you’d call them ‘mutations,’ but no one does anything wrong to make these mutations happen. They just happen.
Further, some schizophrenia gene misspellings confer risk for multiple disorders, not just schizophrenia. Some of these misspellings confer risk for bipolar, autism, major depression, schizoaffective disorder, and some forms of intellectual disability.
Some of the gene misspellings for autism and schizophrenia are even at the same gene location. Schizophrenia gene misspellings tend to be ‘switched letters’ where as autism misspellings tend to be ‘missing letters.’
And sometimes the gene misspellings of schizophrenia are actually found along with other gene misspellings, as is the case with cardio-velar facial syndrome, which confers about a 40% risk for severe psychiatric disorders.",schizophrenia
360,"It’s very very unlikely.
There’s ZERO evidence that there is any genetic component. It’s infinitely more likely that it’s environmental. Meaning it’s either learned behaviour (from a parent or other family member with a mental illness), or the result of unusually high stress levels in childhood.
Word of warning .. those who claim that the science tells us schizophrenic brains show changes, therefore it must be genetic, are pretty much talking voodoo. Yes such brains show changes. What they DON’T show is how those changes occurred (and it’s important to point out here, that if there’s one thing we know about brains, it’s that stress changes them).

Schizophrenia is very often inherited.
Hereditary conditions start showing symptoms whenever they are genetically ‘programmed’ to do - by their genes. It’s the genetic code that determines when disorders become obvious. For example, Alzheimer’s Dementia is looking more and more like a genetic disorder, and it doesn’t make itself obvious until the person is 55 or 60 years or older.
With schizophrenia, it starts in the womb, with tiny genetically caused errors in brain development. Yet those errors don’t get ‘uncovered’ until usually young adulthood, when the brain goes through a bit of ‘fine tuning.’",schizophrenia
365,"The predisposition to develop psychosis is genetic (hereditary), but the associated gene variants ( “defective back-ups”) connected to psychosis must be triggered and “turned on” by environmental happenings and our interpretation of those happenings. More simply, some people have inherited tendencies toward a psychotic disorder that may or may not develop, depending on their life experiences.
Environmental triggers for psychosis include physical and emotional abuse or neglect and other traumatic life incidences, severe malnutrition, change in hormones (as during or after pregnancy, and rarely, thyroid imbalances), particular fungi and viral infections (particularly toxoplasmosis), metal and other chemical toxicities, and even food sensitivities and allergies. The chemical and food tirggers are almost universally reversible. Marijuana and other illicit drug use before the age of 25 or 30 Leading Psychosis Expert To His Students: To Avoid Risk, Hold Off On Pot Til 30, can also be a trigger in those predisposed to psychosis, and in these cases it is often and tragically not reversible. :(
Bummer on the last - I am an advocate of legalization of marijuana but also of age restrictions; I have implored on my nephews and nieces to not try marijuana or other illicit drugs until they reach at least age 25 — when their brains are fully developed — as I know that our family carries the genetic precursors for psychosis and other serious mental health disorders, and these can be activated by THC and other drugs. After 30 or so, they can go for it all they want (with marijuana, at least), if they choose.
You can know if you and your family are at risk (i.e. possess and pass onto children) the gene set potentiality for a psychotic disorder, for one, if you have one or more family member with a diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder (with or without psychotic features), or other psychotic disorder. A number of serious mental and physical health issues that are not in the psychotic realm — such as OCD, depression, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, premenstrual disphoric disorder, various autoimmune disorders, seizure disorders, and various other neuropsychiatric disorders can also be risk factors. Genetic and other medical testing for this and other disease potentialities is getting better and better.
Rarely, one can also develop a temporary psychotic episode with no predisposition, in reaction to a drug(s), but unlike the turning on of psychosis in those predisposed under age 30, this is temporary.

Regardless, it's essential to observe that having a family foundation of schizophrenia doesn't guarantee that someone will encourage the issue.

Various characteristics are acknowledged to add to its new development, and associations between these characteristics and regular factors moreover expect a section. Subsequently, while there may be a genetic tendency, regular variables, for instance, stress, injury, drug use, and youth experiences can similarly influence whether someone makes schizophrenia. While considering the acquired piece of schizophrenia, it's essential to fathom that the bet isn't impartially appropriated among family members. The closer the natural relationship to someone with schizophrenia, the higher the bet. For example, the bet is higher for first-degree relatives (gatekeepers, family, kids) diverged from extra far away relatives.

367,"The schizophrenia spectrum disorders have the following labels:
Schizophrenia

Schizoaffective Disorder
They revolve around the same symptoms (see below) except schizoaffective is a tiny different:
Two of the bipolar and mood disorders include the below:
Bipolar Disorder
Major Depressive Disorder
Now look at some of their symptoms:
As you may have noticed, there seems to be some repetition and redundancy going on. To answer your question, I would first strip the labels and deal directly with the symptoms. Looking at symptoms clarifies what exactly a disorder is. So in the case you mentioned, how to differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in its early stages before it becomes full blown would be like asking how to differentiate between what you see in the above images. As you can see a lot of it is the same. So it’s difficult to answer you until you specify which symptoms you are concerned about.
The above symptoms in my opinion are actually a subject of their own. Let’s take Depression for example. Responding to it early is possible and thus dealing with it before it gets full blown. Differentiating it between the Depression of schizoaffective disorder although part of the schizophrenia spectrum would be contradictory as it’s the same symptom. In my opinion, as you can see there is a lot of hidden complexity when asking the question you asked until the label is removed from the symptoms.
When the extreme of Bipolar Disorder is at its height, it can induce hallucinations (a symptom of schizophrenia). These are the same hallucinations so catching them early and differentiating between them before getting full blown is a difficult question to answer because of their variability. Take for example how hallucinations can be intermittent and things can go into remission. Then you have patient case individuality. It would be better to generally deal with the symptoms as a subject of their own. Social isolation can cause some of the symptoms mentioned above so responding to it early may prevent them.
As a point of information in case you find it relevant, did you know Schizophreniform Disorder is Schizophrenia that doesn’t go beyond 6 months? It’s the same thing but the time aspect allows the use of different terminology.
Suffice to say that the symptoms vary from patient to patient in different ways including time and dealing with labels I feel will become obsolete in the future. Symptoms are the essence of what’s going on. This is why my answer went straight to the symptoms because in my observation, dealing with labels doesn’t make sense according to language rules. Labels to me are linguistic corruption if you analyze them closely.
To further your understanding, if you would like to see schizophrenia spectrum disorders/bipolar and mood disorders stripped of their labels and any duplicate symptoms you can use this web function:

This will help you see how much redundancy and similarity there is and why there is so much confusion. This is why I don’t deal with labels and how that has allowed me to understand them better. By the way, Bipolar Disorder until recently accommodated symptoms that didn’t seem like Bipolar Disorder. They eventually gave those symptoms a separate label and renamed it to Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or DMDD. That’s one example of how their classification system has design flaws.
The DSM in my opinion is somewhat unstable and doesn’t involve a natural classification system.
In my experiments, at the symptom layer many mood disorders and schizoaffective disorder are almost the same thing (see below):

Bipolar Disorder, on the other hand (also referred to as Manic-Depression), is when a person suffers from both depression and mania (or sometimes mixed states of both at the same time).
Someone with bipolar disorder may experience severe depression, where they don’t want to eat, or they eat constantly. They may want to sleep all the time. They may feel hopeless and worthless. They may feel suicidal. They might cry easily, and small setbacks might seem like huge setbacks to them. A dropped glass, which might be a very minor thing in the big picture, might make them feel like they are a constant screw-up and that all they do is screw things up or hurt others. And so forth. The dark pit of depression is not a good place.
I am going to make a rather controversial statement here: Suicide is not selfish! The suicidal person just wants their pain to stop, and they don’t see any other options. They aren’t thinking logically. They are desperate for help! Suicide happens when a person’s pain exceeds their ability to cope with that pain. If you either reduce the pain, or increase their ability to cope - perhaps adding more coping techniques, medications, support, and so forth, you tip the scales away from suicide and back to survival. https://www.metanoia.org/suicide/
The other part of bipolar is the mania. Now, just like the depression, each person with bipolar may experience different aspects of mania. Mania can include racing thoughts, poor decision-making (such as over-spending), irrational beliefs (such as the belief that you are able to fly), inability to sleep, and more. Just like depression, it can be life-threatening, depending on how severe it is.
The thing is, bipolar people don’t hear voices (unless they have another illness as well). They feel too much, the opposite of “reduced emotional expression”. Now, people with depression, bipolar, and other mental illnesses may put on, “The Mask”. This is common.
“The Mask” is when someone is feeling like shit, but knows that most people don’t want to see that, so they put The Mask on and pretend to be happy, even though, inside, they are in severe pain.

Evidence That Schizophrenia is a Brain Disease
Data from modern scientific research proves that schizophrenia is unequivocally a biological disease of the brain, just like Alzheimer's Disease and Bipolar Disorder. For one thing, schizophrenia is now known to be partially caused by genetics and to be inherited. For another, modern non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computerized Tomography (CT), have documented structural differences between schizophrenic and normal brains. Individuals with schizophrenia have up to 25% less volume of gray matter in their brains, especially in the temporal and frontal lobes (known to be important for coordination of thinking and judgment). Patients demonstrating the worst brain tissue losses also tend to show the worst symptoms.

The same person may be called schizophrenia by one person and bipolar by another. There is no unanimity. It all points to the fact that the myth of mental illness is a well sold out idea and people recover all the time from both conditions. Fortunately, i know many such people.

These people often function poorly after diagnosis but some can function well between episodes. People with bipolar disorder have episodes of mania or very depressed mood. Mania is usually a state of elevated mood, feeling ""on top of the world,"" during which people often engage in behaviors of excess which might include wild spending sprees especially when they can not afford it, excess sexual activity, excess talking or speaking rapidly, working on projects for many hours continuously with little need for sleep, or other excessive behaviors. These behaviors often get them into trouble legally or otherwise. They may also experience psychosis (hallucinations, delusions or confused thought as above).

Stereotyping in this way is dangerous and stigmatizing. There are many people who live with schizophrenia and can function well. Perhaps you have not heard of Elyn Saks, for example?

374,"Bipolar disorder causes shifts in mood, energy level, and thinking. Schizophrenia causes a person to appear to lose touch with reality.
People with bipolar disorder may experience episodes of mania and depression often with periods of relative stability occurring in between.
Individuals with schizophrenia
experience symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions. Some people with bipolar disorder also experience symptoms of psychosis.
Because of the overlap in symptoms getting the right diagnosis can be challenging. Also, a person can have both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which can complicate diagnosis.
Some people have schizoaffective disorder which involves a combination of schizophrenia symptoms and mood disorder symptoms.
JIM W",schizophrenia
375,"The fact is that acute mania in some bipolar patients is almost indistinguishable from schizophrenia. Mania can also involve hallucinations (auditory, visual, olfactory) and delusions. And bipolar disorder is often effectively treated by the same antipsychotics prescribed for schizophrenia.
The difference is that bipolar disorder will be marked by mood swings. Bipolar patients will not always be manic. They may also be depressed, and go through long periods without experiencing hallucinations and delusions, even without medication or other treatment. The hallucinations and delusions are not the hallmark of bipolar disorder - they are complications of it.
Of course, people suffering from schizophrenia get depressed, too. But it isn't a separate phase. Those with schizophrenia also frequently suffer from disorganized thinking that's different from the flight of ideas experienced by bipolar patients suffering from mania.",schizophrenia
376,"What is the difference between bipolar and schizophrenia?
Bipolar disorder causes the individual to experience depressive periods and periods of elevated mood, often referred to as mania or the milder hypomania. The length and change between these states can vary person to person. It’s a mood disorder, meaning that the central problem is disturbance of a specific mood.
During a manic period the person feel abnormally energetic, active but often irritable as well. They usually sleep less but feel energised and active. Often the person is impulsive, irresponsible and experience a lack of judgment.
During a depressive period the person feel down, tired and lack an interest in almost anything. Other common symptoms are:
A lack of apatite or abnormally high apatite
Trouble sleeping
Less energy
Trouble with concentration
Guilt
Anxiety
Schizophrenia on the other hand is characterised by strange social behaviour and difficulties understanding what is real and what is not. The most common symptoms include:
Hearing voices in your head
Reduced emotional expression
False belifes
Confused and irrational thinking and behaviour
Schizophrenia often come with additional disorders like anxiety and depression. Many people confuse it with a split personality (multiple personality disorder) which is not accurate.

377,"Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia can be confused, but they are different chronic mental health disorders. Some of the symptoms can overlap. However, bipolar disorder primarily causes extreme mood shifts, whereas schizophrenia causes delusions and hallucinations.",schizophrenia
378,"Each of the terms is simply a medical shorthand for a group of symptoms, some of which are shared by each. If the symptoms involve less cyling and more hallucinations, especially voices, one will tend to get a schizophrenia label. If more cycling and less hallucinations then a bipolar label. People with a lot of cycling and some hallucinations get labelled with schizo-affective disorder. I use the word label because there is strong evidence that each of these labels do not have a 1:1 relationship with a specific medical condition. Regardless, it is possible that some people with schizophrenia and others with bipolar labels can have the same underlying disorder. The following is from the blog of the Director of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health:
The actress Glenn Close was recognized for co-founding BringChange2Mind, a campaign to reduce negative attitudes toward those with mental illness. In her eloquent remarks accepting the award, Glenn introduced her sister, Jessie Close, and her nephew, Calen Pick, who each battle serious mental illness. Jessie has struggled with bipolar disorder and Calen with schizophrenia.
When Glenn invited Jessie and Calen to make a few remarks, the evening really became historic. Together, they described a journey undertaken with Deborah Levy and her colleagues at McLean Hospital and elsewhere over the past 3 years. The research team found that Calen and Jessie shared a rare genomic copy number variant resulting in extra copies of the gene for glycine decarboxylase. This gene encodes the enzyme that degrades glycine, a key modulator of the NMDA receptor, which has been implicated in psychosis. Having extra copies of this gene, it seemed possible that Jessie and Calen would be deficient in glycine, with less activity of the NMDA receptor. When Dr. Levy and her colleagues gave glycine to Jessie and Calen under double blind conditions (in which neither doctor nor patient know whether glycine or placebo is being given), the response was like giving insulin to a person with diabetes—their psychiatric symptoms largely resolved. When the drug was stopped, their symptoms returned. When they received glycine again under non-blind conditions, the same improvements were observed. [NIMH · Celebrating Science]

Clearly, these two people, with their two different diagnoses, most likely have the same illness and one different from many other people labelled with the terms bipolar or schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
379,"I am not an expert at all so keep that in mind.
In simple terms bipolar is a condition that causes huge swings between mania and depression. The old name for the condition was manic depression. During depression they can be reclusive, unsocial and even suicidal. During the manic phase they can be extremely effusive, have uncontolled behaviours such as buying sprees and staying awake for long periods in their over exited state.
Scizophrenia, on the other hand, is someone who can go through long periods of ‘normal’ life with episodes of psychosis where they have disorganised thoughts, changes in behaviour ( in the old days they would say they had a split personality for this very reason). Delusions, false memories, paranoia in some cases. Plus other symptoms that vary by the individual and dependent on the severity of the illness.
Both can be controlled by medication, but even medicated (at least in the case of scizophrenia from my experience with a family member with the illness) things can go off kilter sometimes leading to a hospital stay where they may wean them off the drug they currently use and onto a different medication that is more effective.
I wouldn’t want either condition as I have seen what it does to the person with it, and also how hard it is for the parents, siblings, spouse, etc.",schizophrenia

Those with Bipolar and transient psychosis are classified as being Bipolar with Psychotic Features.",schizophrenia
381,"Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are distinct mental health conditions, each with its own set of symptoms and characteristics.

383,"There are generally clear and distinct differences between Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder but this is not always the case. Schizophrenia usually has symptoms like Hallucinations, Delusions, and Thought disorders .
Bipolar Disorder is usually defined as a mental disorder marked by alternating periods of elation and depression. Many people tend to be manic and seldom depressed. There are two types of Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar 1 Disorder which may have episodes of mania or depression which can be mild, moderate, severe or severe with psychotic features. Bipolar II Disorder’s principal feature is being depressed with infrequent periods of hypomania.
Things can become confused when Bipolar Disorder is severe with Psychotic Features which may look much like Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder.
There is also a diagnosis of Schizoaffective disorder which is a chronic mental health condition characterized primarily by symptoms of Schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and symptoms of a mood disorder, such as mania.",schizophrenia
384,"Both of these conditions are considered severe mental illnesses.
It is difficult to treat either of them for different reasons. People with schizophrenia may well have delusions and hallucinations without the correct treatment, while people with bipolar will more than likely have mania and depression without treatment.
The treatment is different in some respects, but similar in others. Bipolar is a mood disorder so requires mood stabilizers, whereas people with schizophrenia will likely require anti-psychotics for their hallucinations and delusions.
The crossover is when people with bipolar 1 have either delusions, hallucinations or intractable depression. They may well need anti-psychotics as well.
But these two are very difficult diseases to treat. It is a fine art in the hands of a professional. They may need to try various medications until stability is maintained.",schizophrenia

Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are different, may be slight symptoms can make you think both are same
Bipolar disorder involves thr shift of energy and the shift of their mood that is from total excitement they suddenly shift to complete ignorant to happiness. These shifts can destroy their daily performing activites. Simily they have mood swings and experience depression. Also in bipolar disorder person can experience hallucinations and delusions.
Treatment involves mood stabilizers
Coming to schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is a chronic condition of severe debilitating mental illness with the pshychotic symptoms.Patients with schizophrenia experience severe symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. They may also have severe suicidal thoughts and other mental problems
Treatment requires antipsychotic drugs and psychosocial activities.",schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is difficult for me to discuss in full detail, there are sooo many explanations and factors but hope this helps, thanks for the request
Thought I'd add a bit more. Schizophrenia is a primary disorder. Bipolar is also a primary mood disorder but can include psychosis. However, because of similar symptoms differentiating between the two can at times be difficult. Indeed there is an intermediate diagnosis for Schizo Affective Disorder.",schizophrenia
388,"At the core bipolar is a mood disorder, schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. Former is characterised by the cycling between (hypo)manic and depressive episodes, whereas latter being relapsing episodes or a chronic state of psychosis that waxes and wanes in intensity and manifestation overtime. Both are serious long-term mental illnesses, the diagnosis isn’t to be taken lightly.
To quickly go over for the uninitiated.
Symptoms of psychosis includes: hallucinations, delusions (fixed false belief that cannot be reasoned out of), disorganised thinking, grossly disorganised behaviour, and negative symptoms such as avolition (lack of motivation), anhedonia (reduced capacity to feel pleasure), flat affect (reduced facial expressions), social withdrawal, etc.
Mania is a state of abnormally elevated arousal, affect, and energy level; depression is like the mirror opposite, which includes low mood (leading to sadness, guilt, suicidal ideation…) and aversion to activity.
On average the functional impairment is greater in those with schizophrenia than bipolar, but that’s not to say schizophrenics have it worse. As usual, it’s quite individual by how debilitating one’s unique set of symptoms and challenges are.
A person can have both bipolar and psychotic symptoms. If the psychosis is congruous with those mood episodes it’s labelled as “bipolar with psychotic features”, whereas if it’s incongruous (the psychosis is still present outside those mood episodes) then the diagnosis is “schizoaffective”. The distinction might be rather arbitrary.
Otherwise the similarities aren’t that many as they fall into different families in a sense, distinct from each other and far from interchangeable. From time to time they intermingle to form a hybrid exhibiting both traits.",schizophrenia
389,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.
Source: Schizophrenic, currently off my meds (I should be on meds, I will decide based on my symptoms) and working a nice high paying job. I intend to write a book about my experiences and monetize it. I have what is called “awareness” I know that I am sick. Many schizos are not as lucky as I am. The “paranoid” type of schizo, seems to leave mental reasoning and faculties intact. I still have my radio detection device, my brass helmet (to guard against radio waves etc.) and other countermeasures. At the time it all made perfect sense. How am I dealing with it? Well I have a schizo friend who says there is no upside to it, everything is terrible. I disagree. If and when I choose to make my illness public, I will have the ultimate excuse. And I have an excuse to be lazy, to not shower, to not cut my nails. It’s fucking great. I am taking ownership of my schizo, and will probably publish a book about it. By the way, delusions of grandeur is another symptom of schizophrenia.
Take care and good luck… one of the main ways people “recover” from schizophrenia is to help others. Problem is not everyone is the helping type, and not everyone needs help. I will see who I can help in this life, but first I have to look after myself. And make the most out of the time I have, because life expectancy of a schizo is 15 years less.",schizophrenia
390,"I started aged 20 by suddenly becoming paranoid that police were watching me and going to come and take me to jail even tho there was no reason for that to happen. Then I started believing my telephone was bugged.
Then the tv had special messages for me and was watching me.
Then people in the street started looking like the people in a Heironymous Bosch painting
Hieronymus Bosch
(See the faces in Christ before Pilate down the right hand side of the Wikipedia page- they all look wicked or evil).
(To this day when I watch the series Grimm on tv I remember how I thought people were all like the shape changing characters on that show).
Then I started hearing voices.
They sound like real people but are telling me horrible things about myself or making frightening suggestions or just outright nonsense but I am scared because the voices seem like real people who are either weirdos or cruel or weird and they have bled thru from another dimension into this one.
I was barely able to sleep at night for the voices and forgot my personal hygiene.
I stopped being able to get myself up in the morning and was to scared to leave the house to go to work.
My HR manager told me to take time off work and get help.
I just stayed in my apartment and also didn't eat properly.
My parents finally took me home after all this happening over a 2 week period and tricked me into seeing a therapist.
The therapist prescribed me medication, rest and later Cognitive Behaviour Therapy.
I did leave my job but after 6 months I was back in the swing of things.
That was over 3 decades ago.

i had difficulty sleeping.
When i walked up the step to work, I felt a huge pain in my groin area making walking difficult.
My work was affected i rowed in a loud voice with no one in particular. My work relationship was affected. I was reported to Human Resource. I resigned been unable to function normally.
The reason i resigned too was i was afraid i will not feel better.
I row with my mother alot (care giver) without reason.
My mother took me forceable to the hospital where i was admitted for two weeks and sedated.
On release from hospital i was given medication which i still use dutifully.
I am trying to cope with the side effects of the medication, one of which is over sleep roughly two days every week. The doctor said that was a good thing (sleep) I did not argue.
During the course of recovery i had to deal with the public perception and still do.
Now that i am feeling a lot better, it helps me to chronicle the past with a view to understanding my condition in a revelant forum. I am always interested in reading and researching the sickness. I reach a lot of similar people at my clinic and identify with them.
I can now articulate myself, that was difficult plus the interest to articulate was not there on the onset of my sickness.
In my case i suspected something was wrong to me before hand, on admission my care giver related to the doctor on my condition, I was clueless. During the course of attending clinic i related my feelings.

392,"For the majority of people , subacute symptoms or prodromal symptoms start around the age of 15 or 16. You may start having less motivation or less initiative than you had previously, for instance you may not feel like playing basketball anymore or singing in the girls choir and you don't really know why, you may have interrupted sleep or start to sleep more than usual and your appetite may change. You may start having thoughts that seem odd or bizarre, that you don't dare tell anyone, or you may start coming up with some really wild ideas, for instance you may start thinking more about religion , space, infinity etc. You begin to notice that you hear everything at the same decibel, like people's voices, the fan, the clock ticking so its helpful if you spend more time away from people so it won’t be so loud. You may see flashes or lines out of the corner of your eye. You may hear your name being called but when you turn there is no one there. Sometimes people can get scared that other people are talking about them in a negative way, or watching them or putting things in their food . During this time you know your thinking might be off but you can't figure out why you are thinking this way- in other words you still have insight . Without getting help at this early stage your insight slowly disappears and you start believing your thoughts more and more over time. At some point if you go without treatment you are unable to tell what's real and what's not real.

394,"Most naturally occurring schizophrenia is seen to develop in post pubescent ages between 16 and 30 and is more prevalent in males. There is a strong tendency in some families towards schizophrenic tendencies which suggests a genetic component. Drug induced schizophrenia occurs in both males and females and is distributed evenly throughout the population. It seems to result when a person uses enough chemical substances that some of the brain structures and or functions are damaged. The resulting behavior is clinically indistinguishable from naturally occuring schizophrenia other than the fact that the chemicals have been used. If a person is behaving schizophrenic while using illicit narcotics and they continue to use those substances there may come a time when stopping use of the drugs does not stop this schizophrenic behavior. There may be times when a tendency towards “schizophrenic behavior"" is shown by a person diagnosed with some other mental illness or process. If it is transitory it is not considered true schizophrenia. If it persists then an additional diagnosis or rediagnosis is sometimes considered to include schizophrenia",schizophrenia
395,"Prodromal or early indications of schizophrenia include difficulty with focus, attention, or concentration, increased difficulty keeping up with daily living tasks especially school or work. Increased difficulty with social functioning or increased social isolation. There may be odd or unusual thoughts. There may be distorted perceptions especially hearing things that others don't hear or seeing unusual things that others don't see, or there may be fears that haven't been a problem for you in the past. These things may be accompanied by anxiety. Family or close friends may tell you that you are acting differently, even though you yourself don't notice any difference. However, you may not have schizophrenia; other problems such anxiety disorders or depression may be the explanation. If you worry that you have schizophrenia you should see a counselor, psychologist or psychiatrist right away. There may be a mental health or crisis hotline in your community that you may call.

396,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia
397,"As a forensic psychologist who worked in State hospitals for decades and diagnosed patients for legal purposes (such as civil commitment) I think I am qualified to answer this question.
People who suffer from schizophrenia may show some signs early in life - extreme shyness, social insecurity as well as a kind of emotional rigidity - but overt symptoms such as paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations typically emerge in late adolescence and early adulthood. Interestingly, in women, the development of symptoms may emerge much later, even in middle age. There clearly is a genetic role in schizophrenia, as first degree family members often demonstrate the same brain anomalies as the person who suffers from schizophrenia but may or may not develop the symptoms.
Schizophrenia is now understood to be a “spectrum disorder,” like autism. The sufferer may have a severe case or a mild case and everything in between, and the severity of symptoms may vary widely over time. “Antipsychotic” medications may help to ameliorate some “positive” symptoms, such as hallucinations and florid delusions, but typically the patient will continue to demonstrate “negative” symptoms such as social isolation and paucity of speech. Positive symptoms frequently return because the patient has stopped taking the medications due to unpleasant side effects - obesity, metabolic syndrome, etc. - or because the symptoms are no longer present so the patient quite sensibly thinks, why keep taking these terrible meds if the disease is gone? This is the most frequent reason for re-hospitalization.
Anyway, the simple answer to your question is late adolescence and early adulthood, but there is of course tremendous variation. Some research indicates that if you can see the signs earlier and begin treatment, the outcome will be better.

398,"You may not be able to tell if you're at the onset stage of schizophrenia. I think it makes sense to read up on the symptoms, and see if you have any. If you do -- then it makes sense to work at a treatment.
I've had very good luck with these two, namely:
1.) Exercise - for the negative symptoms.
2.) Diet - for the positive symptoms.
Mine was a typical course of the illness, with my first major event at age 20, and lasting a week -- and hospitalization not for another 9 months with a second event. Before this, I didn't have much of an inkling at all that I was subject to the illness -- though at age 15 I remember thinking that if I ever became mentally ill, I'd not necessarily want to see myself in a recovered (but damaged) state -- which is an odd thing for a fifteen-year-old to think. That was the extent of my 'warning' which is pretty close to none at all.
I spent 15 years suffering with the illness, all the while being very skeptical of people who said I'd never recover, and that I'd have to be on drugs for the rest of my life -- and they proved to be wrong, but it is a huge (immense) amount of effort which is involved in recovery, not for the faint of heart. My experience seems to be such an anomaly that medical professionals are skeptical that I ever had the illness. (I was hospitalized 10 times for schizophrenia, and had the typical symptoms.) Such is the state of medicine today.
Here is a good link to learn more about the symptoms of schizophrenia, the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders:
What are the DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia?
The terminology is a jargon (basically, they have meanings may be different from the common usage in everyday speech) so do a little extra research into the symptoms listed, if you're curious.
Also -- the onset stage is called ""prodromal"" or ""prodrome"" -- and you can find scientific articles specifically about the prodromal stage of schizophrenia, like the following:

UPDATE:
I’ve added the specific description of the symptoms here, in case the link above is broken. It’s a direct quote of this page in case you have trouble with access. What are the DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia?:
The specific DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia are as follows:
The presence of 2 (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), with at least 1 of them being (1), (2), or (3): (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and (5) negative symptoms
For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in 1 or more major areas (eg, work, interpersonal relations, or self-care) is markedly below the level achieved before onset; when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of interpersonal, academic or occupational functioning is not achieved
Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for a period of at least 6 months, which must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated); prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symptoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions
Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms or (2) any mood episodes that have occurred during active-phase symptoms have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness
The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse or a medication) or another medical condition
If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms or schizophrenia are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated)
In addition to the 5 symptom domain areas identified in the first diagnostic criterion, assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for distinguishing between schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",schizophrenia
399,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?

401,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.
Image Of The Human Brain - Unsplash.com
After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.

402,"This is a really good question.
I read a book called, “Schizophrenia Healed”. It was by a British man who had been hospitalized several times. He got saved and through prayer, effort, and years, his doctor said that he showed no signs of the illness.
He said that of the schizophrenia patients he knew they all seemed to manifest symptoms at 20–22. Why that particular age I don’t know. Maybe because the body is totally done with growing and it changes your emotional perspective? Not sure.
Of the family members that have the illness it did seem to manifest at that age. Before that they showed symptoms of apathy which was mistaken for depression. However at the age of 22 it was as if their perception of reality changed, and they never got “right” no matter how many medications and counseling.
In the British guy’s book I mentioned there was a component of rejection. His mom never wanted a boy. His relationship with his mom was also a source of anxiety for him. Whenever he had to go see her he would get severe depression afterwards and would need to be monitored closely.",schizophrenia
403,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
404,"I don’t know the actual statistic, but in my case I think I’ve pretty much recovered from it.

I calmly explained what was happening to the 911 operator. The cops came (I left the baseball bat I was wielding inside) and took me away. On the way to the hospital, I asked the cops a question.

405,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
406,"I had the opportunity to be a member of a team of researchers that identified and treated early onset psychosis - either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychosis before the brain converted into full psychosis. The symptoms that people first develop are not the same as the symptoms that people who are having an acute first episode. Onset symptoms are called PRODROMAL or Subacute ( the period before) . During the study we treated individuals between the ages of 12 and 25 over 10 years. The average age of onset of symptoms was 15.8 for males and 15.6 for females. All of our clients noticed that something wasn't right in the way they were thinking and or feeling. They knew something was changing but didn't know what or why. They didn't have a good reason so they would try to make one up mostly for their parents sake.
A classic example : 14 year old male with history of grandmother with paranoid schizophrenia. Always has been outgoing at school, A student , sometimes A few B’s , plays soccer , runs track and plays ultimate frisbee in the Spring . Has a big group of friends and enjoys spending time with his family which includes 2 older brothers , also in high school.
Stressor: a recent refusal 2 weeks ago by a girl to the dance with him. This really hurt his feelings. Grandfather who he was close to passed away 2 months ago. Since then his sleep and appetite have been off. He has missed soccer practice 4 times, and didn't show up to his game this past Saturday because he was “ tired”. He hears a slight buzzing outside that won't go away and he swears someone is whispering his name at class just to bug him. Because when he turns around no one is there. He thinks maybe he is imagining it and he just needs more sleep. He has been staying in his room while he has been at home because every time he sees his brother Jack , Jack’s face elongates . He also got a C on a test this week because he it was just to difficult to understand all of the material he was suppose to know. . He doesn't understand what is happening but knows that it is strange and he wants things back to normal.
This is an example of a typical onset and a client that we would enroll into the study . As you can see the symptoms are there but it depends who is looking and what they are looking for . Pulling away from activity , decline in grades and isolating from family were classic prodromal negative symptoms that clients shared.
I hope this was helpful.

408,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
409,"For me it appeared when I became aware of other religions and mythologies and also when I delved back into being Christian. I think to be Christian or catholic is supposed to be a tangible spiritual experience that one should strive for and some people like me god needed to do a lot of unraveling to to get me into form. I think where I also was studying non Christian religion some of these concepts crept in and I was practicing more than one religion at once but Jesus was more or less like, you apparently have time, if that’s what your interested in, let me show you. For me scizophrenia was the state of shock at coming out of living to myself that I was an atheist. For me scizophrenia was also demons trying to get their jabs in before I came to an understanding of how to have a spiritual self defences with things for example like intercession of saints.

411,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends.

412,"It is most definitely real, and one of the most researched of all mental illness.
I have been a hospital patient several times due to mental illness. Specifically due to major depression and panic disorder. I met quite a few folks suffering from schizophrenia.

The only obvious sign was when you spoke with him. His speech structure was all over the place and incoherent as to what he was trying to say.

It is our interpreter of what we see, hear, smell, taste, touch. If something is going wrong with it in a major way, why wouldn’t my ability in at least some of these areas not be impaired?
Even before I was diagnosed with it this was not a hard concept to grasp. What seems hard to believe is drumming up some kind of conspiracy theory behind the illness. What seems weird is saying that I’m under some kind of demonic oppression.
People. Shit happens. This illness sucks. It has ruined my life and it probably will literally be the death of me one day. It doesn’t help me to question the reality of it - there’s no hope in that direction. My brain has ceased to be normal and probably never will be again.",schizophrenia
414,"Yes it do. But its just a term made by doctors to describe the mental state of a person for whom a different kind of reality is created by his mind. But who knows, maybe the reality created by the mind of schizophrenic person is actually real and the one we see is false.
Its just that the reality that we perceive is the same as majority of the people and hence the reality of the minority people is considered as mental illness.",schizophrenia
415,"Does diabetes exist? Does heart disease exist? Does cancer exist? Does opportunity limiting stereotypes and misconceptions exist? Yes!
Schizophrenia is not, ""split personality."" There are several sub classes of the disease; disorganized type is, by far, the sub type with which I have most frequently encountered as a community based social worker. An individual with schizophrenia can lead a relatively meaningful and satisfying life provided they receive appropriate treatment and follow thru with the recommendations of their physician/psychiatrist.
The predominate symptoms of Schizophrenia are hallucinations and delusions and the presence and or increase in frequency and/or severity are an indicator of psychosis (a break with reality). People with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses doesn't seem to receive much attention unless it is relation to gun violence which is unfortunate on many levels; not the least of which is depersonalization of a class of individuals who share the same disease. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be a victim of crime rather than the perpetrator, especially when untreated and exhibiting bizarre behavior. It is important to distinguish between hallucinations and pseudo hallucinations. A hallucination is seeing, hearing, and/or smelling something that is not present in reality; the person experiencing the hallucination believes it is reality based. The most common types are auditory and visual with olfactory hallucinations being the least common. A pseudo hallucination is similar to a true hallucination in every way except the person is able to distinguish the hallucination as internal and not reality based. A delusion is a belief or conviction that is not true or reality based and usually of an outrageous nature such as believing you are a clone or that you are the only, ""real,"" person and everyone else are robots. As one learns more about the nature of the symptoms it becomes apparent how horrifying it must be to the individual having the experience. The likelihood of experiencing these psychotic symptoms are greatly reduced in severity and frequency in those individuals who follow their treatment protocol which usually includes medication, counseling as well as community support services. Schizophrenia is so real that it impacts just about every facet of the person's life. A CST (community support worker) helps the individual develop and maintain a strategy for stability/symptom remission. The CST will provide support in the form of assistance with finding and maintaining employment and/or housing, medication management (usually providing assistance and oversight with the filling of weekly med. planners), addiction services if appropriate, money management, assistance with legal issues as well as a myriad of other challenges that are difficult to manage unsupported while the individual is spending most of their time trying to cope with this disease.
There is a computer program that provides a simulation of schizophrenia symptoms. A previous employer utilized a drug rep. that had access to it and brought it in. He would not say anything except put the headphones on and hit start. For all I knew he could have been hooking me up with the latest Pearl Jam single. The experience was so unsettling I was shaking for several minutes and that was only a minute of exposure. Imagine a lifetime with these symptoms. After the experience, it occurred to me how irresponsible that was of the drug rep. as he didn't know anything about our team. This program could easily be a psychotic triggering event for individuals with several different conditions. If there is still any doubt about the reality of schizophrenia; this program will likely dispel the myth that there is no such thing as well as promote empathy for people who face the challenges of coping with schizophrenia daily.

416,"As a Schizophrenic and a Psychology student I can assure you that yes, Schizophrenia is a real disease.
Unfortunaly, this disease is still unknowed at its core in the actuality, being highly misanderstood and proportionaly having less variability of treatment.
When we talk about Schizophrenia, we talk about a reality disruption that affects our cognitive capacity of racional thinking. In your mind, the unreality you think its real can be recognized by anyone, except you. Anyone that hear what you say when in crisis Will think exactly the same: “thats not possible”.
When i was in crisis, i thought that things i heard on television was about me, or for me.
I thought that famous persons were talking for me, trying to help me.
Thats ocasionaly named Persecutory Delusion.
Another types of Delusions can be found in Schizophrenic people, such as somatic delusion and the delusion of greatness.
Also, you can hear voices, voices that are not actually there.",schizophrenia
417,"Yes. And also people do see the spiritual realm.
Some go crazy by it.
And those are in the hospital.
Demons take over or angels over human bodies and well.. they end doing crazy stuff humans will judge as crazy. Its like.. do you dream? Do you remember your dreams? Is it just a halluncination or your brain making up stuff? How real is your dream? And how real is your current life?
Now.. the issue is: do humans act weird or freak out?
You see.. when you realize the nightmare of your life.. most people become depressed, angry at their parents, hateful, etc. They hate their lives or their 9 to 5 job.
But think about it. Isnt everyone life but a dream?
Some become drunks and alcoholic or druggies to cope with life and death and depression.
They have “mental health issues"" right? Sort of. But your question was : is schizo real? As real as a dream and our lives. But when they start acting crazy or cant cope.. we take them to the hospital.",schizophrenia
418,"People diagnosed with ‘Schizophrenia’ do have a serious problem and importantly this is known to be a life significant issue, what this throws is serious problems in how the person is affected by treatment or for the some part, mistreatment.
Psychiatry is very good at ‘life operations’; changing the course of flow of a life, but sadly this ability helps many without long term diagnosis, but not necessarily diagnosed ‘schizophrenics.’
From the vantage point of Australian psychiatry it does not get better.
It is important to. isolate and put the patient, called ‘consumer’ here, at a point where they have to come to terms with something not many can fathom.
Mental discipline is necessary from the patient and watching TV and smoking don’t work.
There are real reasons why the patient succumb to poor mental healthy thinking that is not their own choice.
Most sufferers are in a moment of emergency which is why very powerful drugs are employed, but no acknowledgement from psychiatry as to the real advent of such is from factors they ignore.
Childhood trauma, usually sexual molestation. mDNA in womb eg having high testosterone levels will effect mental health because of life adaption stress. Sensitivity could be a factor too. More molestations of males occur in society- rates of diagnosis in males higher and at sexual prime 19–22. Women's peek diagnosis age is around 30 when sex or reproductivity is more important an issue in women.
What has not been examined is that a person suffer an actual time of break- breakdown when they become separated from humanity on a mental level- such requires artful psychiatry which did occur in Victoria under a freudian -relationship model, when it was in practice until 2004.
The idea of shoving such populations together in back streets is a hideous betrayal of humanity to sufferers who for courage and sometimes valour makes war heroes look like chicken goof offs.
Liberal politicians like Jeff Kennet and Mary Wooldridge actually helped, but Labor just wants to look like they help the oppressed by handouts but no answers- state and federal- they like it how it is- someone has to be worse off than you, how else can you control the state ?
If there seems no hope ,live in a licensed dream of Dan Andrews- Royal Commission,( needed as the hope was on fire from neglect .)",schizophrenia
419,"Yes. I support and work with people almost everyday with people who have the diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I see everyday, the people that I support engaging in self talk, and responding to things that I and others do not see.
Often, they aren’t too bothered by their hallucinations, some actually are nearly always chatting like friends do when catching up, laughing etc.
But on the flip side, I have seen first hand someone use a razor to cut their throat because they couldn’t cope with their voices. I’ve also seen someone talk in many different voices, because she has so many voices that she engages with.
Medication can help, it never takes away the hallucinations completely. It does however keep them out of hospital, for the most part. Sometimes, they will need to go back to hospital for a medication review, or to be treated by medical professionals.
So yes, Schizophrenia is definitely an illness",schizophrenia
420,"Doctors and medical scientists have often been wrong about illnesses in the past, and the present is no exception! I would say there is a significant possibility that schizophrenia is not a real disease and is instead caused by people perceiving things differently than the way most people perceive things! For example, some studies have shown that schizophrenics are not fooled by certain optical illusions such as the hollow mask illusion, where as non-schizophrenics are fooled. But let us take this one step further! Most people in our society tell the exact opposite of the truth about many things, yet most people are not fooled by those mistruths! For example, society claims that people have inalienable rights and that school knowledge is highly valuable to employers. Yet both of these things are patently false as people’s rights are frequently taken away by the justice system, and employers want college degrees not necessarily knowledge! There is a significant possibility that schizophrenia is actually a result of people not realizing that society is lying about most things! In other words, schizophrenia may occur when a person perceives things differently than most other people, and this difference in perception combines with the lies that society tells about most things!",schizophrenia
421,"Every disorder is a cluster of behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that clinical professionals often see occurring together. The question of whether or not any given disorder actually exists, or is a real “thing,” is actually a question about whether these things really do exist together. As such, it touches on philosophical issues, and (speaking as someone with an undergraduate minor in philosophy & religion) such conversations can get pretty hairy and confusing.
In a word, you have opened up a can of worms. Let me see if I can bring things down to a m ore practical level.
During my career I certainly observed plenty of instances where the defining traits of schizophrenia were present and apparent. (Ii those days it was called the 4 A’s - which stood for Ambivalence, Affect, Autism, and … I’ve forgotten the fourth one! Oh well - the ravages of time. [Edit to add] The fourth trait was Association, a cognitive function which is affected in schizophrenia.
Here is an excerpt from the Merck website:
“Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis (loss of contact with reality), hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized speech and behavior, flattened affect (restricted range of emotions), cognitive deficits (impaired reasoning and problem solving), and occupational and social dysfunction. The cause is unknown, but evidence for genetic and environmental components is strong. Symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood. One or more episodes of symptoms must last ≥ 6 months before the diagnosis is made.“
So yes, those traits do tend to occur together. Whether or not that makes schizophrenia an actual “thing” that exists takes us back into the murky philosophy of it.
I’m not sure if I addressed your actual question or not, but I hope I at least did not waste your time.
Great question. Difficult, but great. Thanks!",schizophrenia

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

Schizo affective disorder is almost the exact same as schizophrenia except there is also a mood disorder present. This may be deppression or Bi-polar mood swing type thing. I had a psychotic episode around 2016. I heard voices and whispers almost constantly, telling you terrible thing’s or speaking about your current situation in some manner, further confusing your sense of reality. Strange and paranoid thinking such as you may be Christ or that your neighbor is planning to kill you or watching you. And despite seeing evidence that these thing’s are not actually happening you still carry on as if they are infact real because your ability to tell real from fake is almost completely gone.

426,"Does diabetes exist? Does heart disease exist? Does cancer exist? Does opportunity limiting stereotypes and misconceptions exist? Yes!
Schizophrenia is not, ""split personality."" There are several sub classes of the disease; disorganized type is, by far, the sub type with which I have most frequently encountered as a community based social worker. An individual with schizophrenia can lead a relatively meaningful and satisfying life provided they receive appropriate treatment and follow thru with the recommendations of their physician/psychiatrist.
The predominate symptoms of Schizophrenia are hallucinations and delusions and the presence and or increase in frequency and/or severity are an indicator of psychosis (a break with reality). People with schizophrenia and other mental illnesses doesn't seem to receive much attention unless it is relation to gun violence which is unfortunate on many levels; not the least of which is depersonalization of a class of individuals who share the same disease. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be a victim of crime rather than the perpetrator, especially when untreated and exhibiting bizarre behavior. It is important to distinguish between hallucinations and pseudo hallucinations. A hallucination is seeing, hearing, and/or smelling something that is not present in reality; the person experiencing the hallucination believes it is reality based. The most common types are auditory and visual with olfactory hallucinations being the least common. A pseudo hallucination is similar to a true hallucination in every way except the person is able to distinguish the hallucination as internal and not reality based. A delusion is a belief or conviction that is not true or reality based and usually of an outrageous nature such as believing you are a clone or that you are the only, ""real,"" person and everyone else are robots. As one learns more about the nature of the symptoms it becomes apparent how horrifying it must be to the individual having the experience. The likelihood of experiencing these psychotic symptoms are greatly reduced in severity and frequency in those individuals who follow their treatment protocol which usually includes medication, counseling as well as community support services. Schizophrenia is so real that it impacts just about every facet of the person's life. A CST (community support worker) helps the individual develop and maintain a strategy for stability/symptom remission. The CST will provide support in the form of assistance with finding and maintaining employment and/or housing, medication management (usually providing assistance and oversight with the filling of weekly med. planners), addiction services if appropriate, money management, assistance with legal issues as well as a myriad of other challenges that are difficult to manage unsupported while the individual is spending most of their time trying to cope with this disease.
There is a computer program that provides a simulation of schizophrenia symptoms. A previous employer utilized a drug rep. that had access to it and brought it in. He would not say anything except put the headphones on and hit start. For all I knew he could have been hooking me up with the latest Pearl Jam single.

427,"Let’s just stick with the facts, and hold at the same time the notion that suffering is real, no matter what it happens to be called. It is not a denial of someone’s suffering to tell the truth about science. It’s really not so difficult to get your information from the place which has conducted the lion’s share of research on the taxpayer’s dime (billions in dimes , actually), the NIMH. Now let me quote a recent NIMH Director, Dr. Thomas Insel, who wrote, “Psychiatric diagnoses are reliable but not valid”. What he meant by reliable, is that clinicians speak a common language. NIMH will tell you straight that we have no biomarkers for any mental illness, and that means that we have no physical, objective evidence. This is why there are no objective tests. If you take this fact, and then come to the conclusion that people with diagnoses of “schizophrenia” are either faking it, or being 100% misled, then you have missed the boat. I know a number of people, in my work, who have recovered from a diagnosis of “schizophrenia”. I would never in a million years suggest that the intense journey they experienced was not real.",schizophrenia
428,"Yes, most definitely.
Although more recent DSM editions have divided the disease into a more accurate subdivisions including or not including elements of paranoia etc., the overall diagnosis of schizophrenia is still germane to the topic of mental illness.
Schizophrenia is overly used as a description of behavior, but not well understood by the general public. Delusions are commonly used as the differentiator in diagnoses. These delusions follow a pretty common thread of sexual or religious ideation, with thoughts of paranoia pervading the person’s waking mind.
Sufferers can imagine they have been followed or are being listened to by government or religious authorities, and also commonly complain of sexual harassment by these same authorities. Idle ramblings can accelerate into full blown psychosis, in which the sufferer loses track of all reality, knowledge of time, place, persona.
This is especially important in consideration of how many sufferers are wandering around homeless, and not receiving any meaningful care.",schizophrenia
429,"Oh yes, please be assured that is the case. Just the other day I was reading research (on recovery from psychosis) which said that 67% people recover completely from it. Of course that research was from the US, and I am not sure this would be any but their statistics. But the reality is that many recover in every part of the world.
My own phd is focused on recovery from psychosis (which happens in both schizophrenia and bipolar). I personally know at least a few who have recovered from schizophrenia right here in India itself.
And in case you did not know, John Nash recovered and did not take any medication for at least 25 years of his life. So be assured it is nothing extraordinary, but a matter of dedication and discipline…a majority can recover. But it does not happen by putting psychiatry as the leader of one’s life. Get that clear.",schizophrenia

Often some kind of medication that alters brain chemistry will reduce or alleviate those symptoms, so it appears that these behaviors and perceptions arise from faulty brain chemistry.

432,"I am 46 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia 1.5 years ago by multiple psychiatrists, so I am qualified to answer this as I am experiencing this every day, every hour, every 5 minutes.
I have obtrusive thoughts. I also get tactile sensations of something touching me. It used to feel like something was gripping my right shoulder. At one point, I felt like something was putting wings on my back where I actually felt feathers spring forth one by one in sequence row by row. At the time, I thought I was chosen by God but had been tricked by the devil and it was inside of me. I was completely delusional and hallucinating.
I’m no longer having delusions but I keep getting unwanted thoughts. I am also still getting constant tactile feelings of something touching me or a sensation of a spider crawling on the left side of my ribs. I sometimes also feel something crawling on my back or poking me and get the sensation of throat or lung irritation.
I also get goosebumps all the time as this is happening even right now as I am typing this. It tells me ""I am here."" It even admits to causing the throat irritation. Now, it’s saying that I should not type this out and to stop. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"" in a demonic deep inhuman voice.
When I lay down, I feel snakes crawling underneath me and writhing around. I can also feel something occasionally crawling on me or poking me.
This is classic schizophrenia.
I think the unwanted thoughts are demonic in origin. I cannot audibly hear them with my ears but they are voices in my mind. They are sometimes quiet and behave like a thought but at other times that sound like a person, my voice in fact or they sound like something totally demonic.
One thing is for certain, they always seem to say bad things about God. The voices are definitely from someone else. I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
When I first started experiencing schizophrenia, the voice would pretend that it was my own internal voice and thoughts except they would say evil and cruel things and from out of the blue, they would say “Satan” or “Lucifer” to me over and over. I was freaked out by it and scared out of my mind because I am a Christian.
It even said “my father in hell” when I was shopping for a Bible at a Christian store. I kept wondering, what is wrong with me? Why do I keep thinking negative things about God? Why do I keep thinking about the devil? I would even pray and say, God, why am I thinking this? Please help me! Make it stop!
Then I figured it out. There was another presence with me. I could feel something touch my skin and grip my shoulder or move along my left side. I was horrified and then I felt something move around me. It felt like I was able to detect movement from the spiritual world and could feel something sit down next to me or I could sense footsteps that felt like a vibration to my perception. I know that it was not actual movement but it’s as if I can feel something vibrating my actual perception around me. Almost like it’s a vibration to the camera of my vision. I can even hear a thumping and feel a force of movement when it steps. It just bumped my chair and I can feel it moving along my back and I am about to stop typing and brush it away. But I know it will just reappear a moment later so I am ignoring it for now.
After I figured out that it was not my voice, I stopped hearing my own thoughts in my head. Then, it spoke to me and said that it was a devil and that it was not going to leave. It told me it would be there until the day I died and went to hell. Then it would enjoy tormenting me forever. I was terrified. I even argued with it and said that I was saved because I accepted the LORD Jesus Christ as my LORD and Savior.
I’m telling you it is not my own voice. It is not my mind that is making this thing up. This thing argues with me like it’s another person. It even talks while I am talking and I can’t think two things at once which proves that it is external to me and not me. I can’t think of two completely different things to say at the same time. When we think, it is about something related to what we are talking about. We think about what we are going to say next and the best way to say it.
We can’t think two different things at once. Then again, I guess we can when we lie. All I know is that I just want this to go away but it doesn’t.
The voices I am hearing in my head says things that are completely different to what I am thinking and how I am as a person. They are my complete opposite. They say things that I would never say. Blasphemous things about God and now it’s trying to get me to not believe in God.
It even lies and says it is god but I know that it isn’t. Even when I say ""I don't believe that"" it will try to continue the subject but when I tell it that I know it’s not God, it says ""you got me"" and it gives up.
When I hear this, I just remind myself that God is good and cannot tell a lie. He is full of love and compassion. He would never torment me.
This thing is wicked and cruel. It tells lies all the time. Plus, it is constantly trying to trick me into thinking about selling my soul to the devil by saying things in the first person like I am the one thinking it. I would never do such a thing.
It likes to torment me and make things crawl on me or underneath me when I am laying down. It almost feels like a snake. Its hard trying to fall asleep while this is happening. It’s a total pest. No good being would ever do such a thing. It keeps touching me even as I am typing this by making something feel like it is moving along my back. It’s trying to distract me and pester me. It is even causing a tickling sensation in my throat.
I’ve prayed for it to leave and even went to two different churches where they do deliverance they prayed over me and nothing works. I often pray and continually ask the LORD for forgiveness. Each day, I am still in this personal hell. God help me.
However, now that I know the voices are not my own, I must admit that I feel a lot better once I realized that they were not from me. That they were coming from something else. At first, I could not understand why I would think such a things about God, who I love. Now that I know it is something else, it's easy for me to dismiss the things that it says because I know that I am not the one thinking it.
It’s still disturbing though. No Christian would ever want to hear something singing ""Sweet Satan"" in Jimmy Page's voice from “Stairway to Heaven” played backwards in your head all day. This thing is always twisting things around and it seems to be one step ahead of me when I am thinking something. For example, when I am praying and think my father in heaven it says hell just as I am thinking heaven.
Every day I pray for God to drive this thing to the hell from which it came but this continues every day. It’s now been 1.5 years.
Also, when this started happening and to this day, I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
One other thing I want to point out is that this creature can even play music or bring up scenes from movies to illustrate a point. On occasion it will make a sound in my head like the devil from The Exorcist. Other times, it says things like they are my own thoughts without an actual voice. In fact, most of the time its how it communicates except when it wants to be really annoying. Then it talks in a voice that sometimes sounds like my own or it warps it and sounds like something completely demonic.
Whatever it is, it is not human. It says things no human would dare say. Things that I would be afraid to say.
It totally sucks ‘hearing’ voices. I would not wish this upon anyone. I just felt it laugh at me just now.",schizophrenia

It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
434,"I am 49. I have schizophrenia from past 5 years- a sudden late onset. I have been mostly hearing voices and feeling movements and tactile sensations on my body and have had a delusion (although only once, right in the beginning 5 yrs ago that lasted a few days). I also had mild paranoid thoughts that only lasted a couple months off and on but nothing serious or sustaining- this happened as one of the first signs. I have never been hospitalised. I have also been a Vipassana (mindfulness) meditator for 20 years so I am a strong observer of my mind. Professionally I have been an Electronics scientist and software engineer, done great in academics and career. Hence I am qualified to write this answer. I will keep improving this answer. This is my personal observation and experience of schizophrenia, not based on any religious beliefs. I have also read many schizophrenia papers, talked to people suffering from it in person, through forums or social media accounts and Quora.
Based on my experiences (no beliefs) I am theorising it here. It’s upto to you to believe it. Two things are for sure-
The role of mindfulness meditative practices is imperative to understand schizophrenia and
There are outside forces in schizophrenia.
What is schizophrenia?
Firstly I would like you to check out the TED talk on “How to control someone else’s arm” to understand how we behave when neurologically connected. If our nervous systems are in contact one of us behaves as a master and the other a slave. Thus we can give commands to the other and the other has to follow our will. This has also been confirmed in an experiment called brain to brain communication by university of Washington. You can google it. Now, with this background let's go further.
Secondly, for the medical industry who is doing research- please don’t ignore the details of the symptoms and stress less on statistics. Investigation of schizophrenia needs some physics and metaphysics- just a biology or chemistry view won’t suffice. Also it may be prudent to consider external interference as the starting theory for schizophrenia.
Cause-
Finally in my view and personal experience - schizophrenia is a phenomenon where an external entity (possibly an evil spirit or demon because the activity is demonic by nature) with malevolent intention connects to a human mind and body to do harm. Neurologically it can be seen as a multi mind phenomenon where two minds are connected neurologically. Their mental content (beliefs, feelings, etc) can travel through the human neurological barrier and manifest on the human body thereby allowing the evil spirits’ mind to be felt by the human as if his own. Thoughts, feelings and behaviours of the human thus get affected because the minds of the entity and the human being are connected. An induced thought or feeling causes irrational beliefs, symptoms and behaviours in the human being. I’ll be sharing this in more detail further down.
Why would an evil spirit be able to connect with a human?
If the human’s neurological, physical or mental barrier is weak due to stress, anxiety, depression, nervousness, thinking, muscle weakness, too much thought or feelings etc. But still if human awareness and cognition is strong he or she will be able to distinguish between the evil spirits’ mental content and it’s own.
How these spirits connect I don’t know. But they surely harm by bombarding the human being with vibrations of all kind- due to their connection sensory media like voices, images, smells, feelings etc and physical movements are generated causing sound, visions, etc and tactile sensations in the human. They can also play with the human faculty- memories, beliefs, thoughts and feelings. The idea is to weaken the human faculty mentally and physically so they can be harmed, controlled and possessed. Sometimes sexual harms and pain or torture is also inflicted upon the human being by using movements and vibrations. (I have experienced all the symptoms) Voices help in keeping the connection between the human and the entity alive, it also helps with control. For example if you keep talking to someone it’ll be difficult for the person to concentrate or pay attention on his activities. These entities can be distant and hidden in some cases and evident and within the human beings space in some cases- causing a range in which people experience schizophrenia.
Demons or evil humans?
For a long time once i started experiencing these symptoms, especially voices, I had this theory that these are lowly humans who have learnt some cheap tricks in cults or got access to some kind of signalling devices so they can do such harms. Because who believes in evil spirits? And so I thought they are doing this for terrorism of some kind. My hope was I could catch them some day. For example I thought they would “commit the mistake” of spilling out their names or where they live during “voices” interaction etc. So i would suddenly ask them- “whats your name” etc. But over time I observed their extreme ignorance and extreme “continuity” of harms (they never stop) and feel that this can’t be the work of a human being, not even a deranged psychopath. Humans can’t be so ruthless and cannot do harms “continuously” because they would need to take a food or bathroom break at least? These beings never stop. So its more plausible that these are evil spirits of some kind and for the sake of ease I am calling them demons. Another reason for assuming them as evil spirits or demons is that what they do matches well with what is written or spoken about them according to various spiritual philosophies or texts. Still I am open to the idea of this being a human cultish or witchcraft activity but mainly would like to emphasise here that there is clear interference from outside- not any delusions. Or rather any delusions are actually a result of the play of these demonic beings. So the theory is- “there are outside malevolent harmful forces present in schizophrenia that are the cause of the symptoms”. Who or what they are , we need to investigate and theorise later. Right now we can just investigate the nature of interaction and how the manifestation causes the symptoms. (Many voice hearers and schizophrenics say the same thing- that there are outside forces- demons or targeted individuals theory- but this is ignored by medical science). What I am trying to say is that majority of humans who are suffering from a severe case of schizophrenia- at least hearing voices and feeling tactile sensations, surely attribute the cause of schizophrenia as “external”.
My case and the harms
In my case the demons violate my physical space and live with me. (There is a physical presence and violation I feel and their intention is to possess my whole faculty- which is basically about solving their life’s problem “forever”. If they violate the human space and get inside others they can experience the human faculty which is far superior than theirs-for example my demons like to enact facial expressions very much- they keep tapping into my memory for images and act out various expressions- these expressions can travel to them and help them “feel” the sensations and the expressions. That gives them the “feeling” of being alive or being “someone”. Seemingly they have subtle bodies and so the attachment to a physical form like us) They are also very interested in sex- it is the highest vibration they can enjoy. Their other driver is sexual energy which they collect and feed on to live.
They don’t eat, drink or sleep. They talk to me - it started with berating words for the first couple years (no impact on me except for concentration issues) to gain control over my mind but they had a lot of difficulty defeating my logic. They gave up and now it is normal conversation mostly about themselves- what they want etc (mostly to enjoy harming someone- logic is: since they can’t be happy no one else should be) and do movements using harmful vibrations (heat/burning) that harm my body physically. They can create physical pressure on my body and cause pain, strangulate my throat, cause me to cough, give me pain anywhere, block my thoughts, cause a limp in my walk, give me dream like states, do physical harms etc. All this is temporary and changes. According to them it is their “way of life”. They enjoy harming and are incapable of anything else. The voices say “Maza aata hai”. That is why they do it.
I’ll give you another example of their harms- they had told me about their intention to want me to be disabled (5 years ago) by showing me the image of a wheelchair- my legs and arms should not work because that means I will be on the bed and in a susceptible or vulnerable position which they prefer. They used the word “parapleigic”. I had to google it because i did not know what it meant. At that time I barely heard one or two voices once in a while with rare physical violations. Anyways back to the story, so they kept their word and started harming my legs by doing repetitive front and back movements and in the past two years I have been harmed so much that my feet has enormous swelling due to the inflammation caused by this and walking is now difficult for me. I already have a disability due to schizophrenia. Recently it pushed something burning like sensation into my left arm (shoulder joint point) so now my left arm is twisted. It keeps inflicting pain in it every now and then. I got an X-ray done day before yesterday and the technician found that I have an affected tendon in my left shoulder. The demons don’t let me use the left arm, if I use it to wear clothes or lift my arm for something they immediately instill pain in me. They can also “control” me. Just like in the TED talk “How to control someone else’s arm”. They have also harmed my lower organs by inflicting pain and movements doing physical harms whenever they like. Once the harm is done they are able to send some kind of flux which supposedly collects the sensations on my body and sends it to them- they now being able to feel my sensations. These are not delusions. My legs and arms aren’t working. Btw many schizophrenia patients report this kind of torture which is completely ignored by doctors (I have read all scientific research on schizophrenia).
In my case the harms are too much and the demons don’t hide themselves. They also tell me what they are doing next. I don’t think I was a schizophrenia candidate at all. Some demons are afraid to come in, so they get stuff from multiple people and prefer being distant. In some cases penetrating a human being may not be possible for various reasons like very good mental and physical health etc. Hence it is not possible for everyone with schizophrenia to know there are other beings connected to them.
Also btw my demon says this- “I want someone to stop me, who can stop me. I can’t be caught.”
Telecommunications Signaling
I have studied Electronics engineering and Computer Sc and worked in telecommunications software. I have also done semiconductor electronics research in US. I know a thing or two about signaling. To those who are not initiated to the basic concepts of telephony- voice is modulated after getting mixed with a carrier wave of high frequency so it can be transmitted and sent to a remote location. I want to share that there is signaling happening on and around me all the time. A signal shower comes in and fills my aura (I don’t know what really aura is but what I mean is the area around me that might contain my subtle energy and defines me). I feel it clearly as a flux. It happens at least once a day and especially at night when I am lying down. It fills me up and then movements begin around me or on me to harm me. It seems to me that these movements which have harmed my physical self significantly seem to cause my own signals or flux to be transmitted. The movements are “back and forth” repetitive movements across my body parts. Also the communication with the entities has a lot of methodology - for example they talk to me continuously until I say something in response. The moment I say something (in response to their talking because it’s difficult to ignore) a flux is transmitted from my body to outside somewhere. They are always on the look out for me to talk and respond- as if they get something out of it. Something about the movements and my talking to them helps them. I think they are using carrier wave technology in the same way- (this is nether a joke, nor my belief, nor a lie) when I say something the connection between them and me gets activated (both ways) and transmission of my energy or something else is possible. Sometimes I worry if these are humans and remotely connecting to me because then we are in grave danger. I also think (and have been told) that the more of my vibrations they have , the more control they have over me. They are also after sexual energy. I also don’t know why they tell me stuff- maybe they are too confident that they won’t be caught. Sometimes I think they are human but then what I don’t understand is why would they harm so much and that too continuously. I have refrained from certain topics in this write up for the sake of the not jarring experience of the reader. But there are extremes in the harms they do.
Realm of imagination/ tactile sensations
This is a theory but based on factual observations and also something that medical science will validate. These beings connect with us through our imagination circuitry- creating images, delusions inside us. For those who feel a lot of tactile sensations, and even see auras of beings entering the mind body system in your vicinity- it is not your delusion. It is this beings connecting through our imagination system which is also connected to our motor neurons. When you see an image and feel beings moving around or across you it is the motor neurons connected to the imaginary circuitry that are activated. Like when we imagine something we feel those emotions in our body and can even feel as if we are doing something?
Like if I haven’t completed my homework and I am afraid of going to school tomorrow let’s say I start imagining this- I am walking to my school and seeing my teacher, I feel afraid or avoid him since I haven’t done my homework and then I imagine the teacher sees me and is getting angry at me- while these images play on my mind, my corresponding emotions as well as feeling of walking etc can also be felt during the imagination process although nothing is real. Thus motor neurons and other neural circuitry is activated in imagination. This is already verified by medical science. Now in schizophrenia what I am saying is that patients are NOT imagining anything themselves- they are forced media onto these portals. These demonic beings are utilising the neurological circuits of imagination when it comes to projecting images and tactile sensations on the body. They for example may connect with you and play with images in your mind such that such imagination- paths are triggered. These are not delusions as understood by medical industry. These are external entities having access to your nervous system and playing with it. It is important that medical research pays attention to these things.I know this by noticing keenly for 4 years. Not any beliefs. Currently “everything” is loaded under one term- delusion and people are given psychotic medicines for it believing that they are imagining everything themselves. Medical Imaging has shown that when voices are heard and all these other symptoms manifest- the imagination areas of the brain are activated. But the difference is that we are not doing this by our own selves or due to our own illness- it is happening because the spirit energies connected to us are playing with our system.
Connecting material-
They have multiple invisible substances and mediums that they insert into my space which numbs body sensations and act as a medium to throw things like movements, vibrations into it. This is not my imagination. I can feel it very clearly. One of the stuff inserted has a slippery feel. It is organic. It could be a collection of their gross feelings like greed or something else because (where would demons keep “stuff”). Once they insert it in and around my legs for example they can throw in a movement style like someone else’s walking style. Then when they activate it my legs move like that. The medium keeps the memory of a movement inserted (like Bollywood actor Devanand’s walking style) or facial expression (like Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore’s smile) intact and can be played just like a movie again and again. But mostly they use these mediums or substances to harm you physically- using up and down, back and forth movements to inflict pain and break down your body to make it weak, sexually harm you etc. They have access to our memory so they can download any media and get movement styles ,facial expressions etc from it. They can show the image of a film star for example and download her smile onto my face - the feeling of that facial expression comes into my face. I won’t look like that but I will feel that I have a similar expression on my face- the feeling is similar. If you knew well how mind and body works this could be understood easily.
The flat affect in schizophrenia
The flat affect in schizophrenia is the person not feeling much emotion even while talking about a traumatic event etc. In other words he or she doesn’t seem to exhibit any emotion. I have been dealing with schizophrenia for past 4–5 years, I see it clearly as demonic interference and I can explain what happens and what causes this effect.
Everyday since schizophrenia began as hearing voices in my case, a shower of vibration started coming over me. The shower would be very clear, and would only last for a minute or two in the beginning. It would be also very light and I did not really know what it was for or what it did. But it was clearly a shower of vibrations. Now as months and years passed this shower started becoming a strong flux of vibrations entering me every night from the top of my head. Once the vibrations became palpable I started observing what it did (and continues to do now). The vibrations feel very slippery, craving-like that slide around me- it has a feathery feeling. I have strong aversion for this vibration. It has an organic quality and surely has a heedless or greed-like quality to it. Once it slides in, it covers me everywhere in my body and suddenly all the vibrations I was feeling until now- my own vibrations of pain, heat, numbness, tiredness, itch etc on my body - suddenly vanish. Suddenly there is no feeling. Because of this newly added external layer that acts like a cushion. Here is the side effect- since I don’t feel my own vibrations anymore it also makes me feel “ok” however bad the situation- as in I am no more in any pain or tiredness etc. Because I can’t feel my feelings. It’s through my feelings that I come to know how I am. Now that awareness is gone. But I know this is not normal and is happening because this new additional cover of external vibration is hiding it.
I’ll explain this by the concept of Vipassana meditation since I have been a practitioner for 15+ years. When we sit to meditate on our feelings objectively in Vipassana we first always encounter feelings on the surface of our body especially those caused by outside vibrations or stimulus like the fan running and air moving, the touch of our clothes, someone talking etc. Our mind remains outwardly focused until we can slowly focus our mind on our icy and become capable of seeing what’s going on inside. Until the outside vibrations are dominant we won’t be able to focus on our inner vibrations. This is what happens in schizophrenia. There are outside demonic forces that play with our senses- in this case our body feeling which causes our mind to focus on the outside stimulus only kit allowing us to pay attention to or be aware of our inner vibrations. This causes most schizophrenics to be not aware of their body sensations which causes them to seem to have this flat effect or monotonality of emotion.
Varying symptoms in different people-
Since every person is different and every demon is different and the capabilities and strengths vary, the harms, type and the extent of harms vary in every case- for example in some people with schizophrenia voices are not so persistent as others, in some cases it is about paranoia, in others it’s about seeing scary images etc. Some people go through a lot of torture. Some people hear voices only once in a while. Hence not every one is able to observe or deduce that there is outside interference due to demonic beings.
Paranoia and feeling of control-
The feelings of paranoia and feeling of being controlled by someone are “real” in schizophrenia. The reality is that those feelings are being generated because of the presence of demons and the harms they are causing but since people may not know this they feel a loss of trust in general because they know something is wrong but what or who is unknown. Demons help with the other part. Firstly they have access to our memories, feelings and thoughts. They can play with our feelings, images, sounds etc. Beliefs are formed because of unwholesome feelings and negative thoughts. Demons can insert negative thoughts inside us and make us fall for untrue beliefs. If you especially have mistrust with someone they can accentuate those feelings.Since they have access to human perception and cognition due to their “vicinity” this is possible.
Demons can play with our awareness and cravings and using some of the mechanisms above actually “control” our actions. They “can” make us do something. (I’ll elaborate this later.)
Why is schizophrenia found in families?
In case of schizophrenia it is found in families because demons once connected to a member of the family can connect with other members as well. They are always on the lookout. Sometimes they can connect to more than one member at a time especially if they are living together, in the same space. I know this because my demons do this all the time - at least they try very hard, I don’t know if they are successful. I know they can play with members living with the schizophrenic because there is easy physical access.
Which symptoms are psychosis/delusions and which are NOT?
You might ask me what if this whole thing is a delusion? It is not. I want to clarify what is a delusional state that people experience and what is not and why- “delusion being not being able to see reality at is”.
Hearing voices is NOT a delusion, NOT an auditory hallucination as currently believed in the medical industry. It is a REAL experience because people can hear voices while being fully aware of their present reality. How it is happening? Due to connection with another entity that has access to our mind. When two minds connect there is telepathy- communication at the mind level. Please read my answer about hearing voices here
B P's answer to How would you explain hearing voices
2. Seeing images is NOT a delusion- Many people see images while closing their eyes or see these images continuously for a long time- especially scary images, visions etc. Those are the games of the demon. Why I am saying these are not delusions because while seeing them people don’t lose their awareness. They see the image clearly, the image is being formed inside their neurological system and being fed to the eyes.
3. Feeling tactile sensations is not a delusion as explained above in the “Imagination” section. I can clearly feel the movements which are very deliberate and intentional. These movements can be easily palpable by any human being if you put your hand on the area where the patient is feeling the movement. These are not movements of my body- these are movements from outside on top of me. I can feel two types of movements-1) back and forth, up and down, pressure on body etc - these over a period of time cause pain, inflammation ne degeneration of the body part- for example my feet are harmed so much by these continuous movements that I can’t walk and have swelling 2) intentional movements intended to achieve something like feeling a hand grab me, rub on me, take some stuff from one side of my body and put in on Ian other side repetitively, sexual movements - movements done intentionally to arouse sexually, a hand pushing me or pushing stuff inside me etc. These kinds of movements are experienced by other patients of schizophrenia as well. I’ll add paper references later to this post for evidence.
4. Psychosis or Delusional states where people see things that are not there- these ARE real delusions and these happen to some people with schizophrenia which is due to presence of outside entities. These are mostly multimodal in nature involving a no of senses especially visual. It is the visual component of this that causes the losing of awareness the most. Visual illusion is always the most powerful . What is it like? Like watching a 3D movie and being in a dreamlike state- except all feels very real. But again the reason is demons only.
Here people lose awareness of themselves and start seeing things that are not present for example they may see their dead grandma sitting on a chair etc. This is a delusion although still a play of the demon. The demons are able to do multiple things since they have connection with the human mind- access images, feelings and memories. For example they can choose to bring up a childhood photograph of mine from my mind and show it to me as an image. So while I am typing this for example suddenly an image of my baby time is projected in front of me- I know my imagination is being used because it is not using my normal vision. They can also send harmful vibrations and play with your awareness, increase your cravings or aversions etc. The delusional states of seeing weird images or being in dreamlike states are created by demons by playing with all of the above. Since they have access to memory and imagination they can “create” images of our dead grandma, friends etc as well, to confuse us. That is why ppl see their dead relatives etc.
What causes delusions?
There are separate physical areas in our brain that function as imagination and reality especially in the context of eyes or seeing. The area that sees things as real is the spot right above our eyes on our forehead- the point of meditation and Ajna chakra. The imagination area is right behind it and a little above in our brain. When we imagine our eyes look there. We all know this- it’s behind this spot and a little towards the top. Try it yourself. See what is in front of you and then imagine something. You’ll see how the vision is different- one is using normal vision, one is using imagination. Maybe the focal length or where the image is formed is different in these cases. I think the presence of demons and their play connects these two areas. Due to this, what a person imagines (which is planted by the demon) “seems” real. You hear stories about a schizophrenic seeing his grandma sitting on a chair and perceiving it as real. Also the demons play with imagination a lot using it as a portal to generate and transmit images. Our mind is not able to be in the present due to this.
How can schizophrenics know that they are having delusions?
They can’t know while they are having the delusion. But the delusion ends and they realise that what they are seeing is not true. Now they see there is just an empty chair in front of them, no grandma. There is some sense in us that tells us - this is the truth. Here they are experiencing full awareness. The state of awareness is always a restful state so they go back to it sooner or later. Thus they can know that they are having delusions. You know they are experiencing awareness when they are seeing what you also see. This is just an example in context of vision. Vision plays a very important role in schizophrenia. It is tampered with the most because it can cause the most delusion. Also schizophrenics may have some special dream experiences. Demons are beings living in the field of delusion- which is the place of complete imagination, no reality. So perhaps there is a way or portal for them to connect to our imagination or dream pathways. This can be investigated- can we connect through dreams?
Schizophrenics not feeling any sensation-
The demons are able to play with human thought and feeling. Many schizophrenics have reported this and I would also validate the clear violation of physical space , people in scientific papers have reported auras entering or leaving. These are not delusions. In my case they keep inserting some substance (maybe their own gross feelings) into my physical boundary - this has a mushy and weird feel but is invisible. It slides along my body surface, suffocates me and also immediately takes all my own sensations away. For example if I was feeling pain until now suddenly the pain vanishes. In my case they have also inserted that into my body through the mouth for example. Also after the insertion is done they have control over the movement of this substance or thing etc. They use that to do movements in the body.
Understanding this needs some Vipassana knowledge-We all know that when there is a sensory stimulus to us, our mind and body system responds with a sensation in the body associated with a thought or even more complex- action. My training through Vipassana has taught me to observe this very well. When we sit to meditate we always start with gross sensations especially things we feel due to a stimulus from outside - if the fan is running in summers we feel the wind on our body. Then as we keep meditating we go deeper and start feeling our inner subtler sensations. It is the awareness of these inner sensations that keeps us vigilant about ourselves and what is happening inside us. But if the outside stimulation is a lot going inside is not possible. For example if someone keeps talking to you especially close to your ear, or there is too much visual stimulation, your eyes are open, something is scratching you- our mind can only focus on these outside things and sensations originating due to stimuli from outside.
The same principle is happening in schizophrenia - the voices, the movements, the feelings due to these insertion of outside stuff, images, etc are constantly keeping our minds focussed on the outside. Especially we are unable to feel our own internal sensations of pain, numbness, tingling, burning etc when this outside stuff is present. That is why schizophrenia patients are not able to “feel” much. They mostly feel numb. Sometimes this can also mean a complete lack of awareness of one’s condition. It is the sensations that tell us how healthy or unhealthy we are. Schizophrenics can often be wrong there not having access to most of their sensations.
In my case they have used the substance to do all kinds of movements and vibrations inside me physically that harm the body. I have injury like pain everywhere in my body- I have access to this pain sometimes. (Doctors are “appalled” to see my condition) I prefer the painful feeling to no feeling because I prefer to be aware.
Once they have physical access of you very little can be done.
(I’ll share more about this later)
Medical science-
Medical science has not reached that place where they can prove the existence of invisible beings OR if these are humans connecting remotely. Such knowledge exists in meditative observation of reality. So schizophrenia will remain unsolved for a long time unless medical science joins hands with “Mindfulness” that offers plenty when it comes to the functioning of the mind. Another things is that it is very important to take people’s symptoms seriously not writing them off under an umbrella word of “delusions” and thinking of them as folks who have lost their mind due to their own craziness or incapability. Medical science is also very “tools” and “senses” based. It only believes in what can be verified by tools or the senses. But mind is very vast and deep and beyond the senses. Observation of an aware mind must be accepted as well even if it’s a minority.
Schizophrenia is not caused by childhood trauma or abuse even though there may be connections. These are scientific research done in western countries where drugs use, broken families etc is very common. Other countries should do their own research and get their own findings. I have lived a very happy childhood and adult years and have a strong family. It maybe that your family has an “association” with demons over past years without you knowing even going back generations which can cause these issues. There is a concept of “karma by association” in Buddha’s teachings.
Spirituality is able to explain this much better because it accepts the observation by a present mind as enough validation. There is nothing “irrational” about the presence of demonic beings in the universe who may have lower minds and subtle bodies. We should look at the universe very humbly.
Power of demons-
One thing is clear - demons or these evil spirits (or even evil humans connecting remotely) are not powerful at all. They are very ignorant and pitiful. Very deceptive. They only seem powerful because they are instigated very easily and can harm for no reasons. They are only capable of very low vibrations. These beings are threatened at everything. They also have NO moral limitations.
How demons enter you?
I don’t know if it’s the demon’s body themselves that is in my space or something they are connected to that they can insert or transmit into my space. There is a invisible physical thing that moves around in my space which has a mushy feel and is used to put pressure, instill pain, on me. They can also send vibrations inside me that feel like an electric flux of burning and heat entering me from outside. It’s not the same thing as feeling neurological burning pain inside me. I am able to distinguish between when it’s a violation and when it’s not, clearly. These are termed as tactile hallucinations by the medical industry but there is nothing hallucinatory about it. Other people can feel those movements or vibrations on me too, they are easily palpable. This is the worst that can happen to you. So clearly not delusional.
Why demons connect?
Demonic nature- demons (even if these are humans who know some horrible techniques) have a “superior” life once they connect to a human like this. Their continuous feelings of hatred, aversion, wanting to harm get an object. Harm is their craving. And their craving is satisfied. They enjoy it. The demons are extremely ignorant, deceptive, and harm continuously. They also don’t eat, drink or sleep. I have experienced this personally by waking up in the night to find activity happening on me in the form of movements- these are pain inflicting movements which they do continuously until they move on to a different activity. It used to shock me earlier to see them do something continuously but not any more.They are very repetitive in their actions.
Karma- Theirs and ours- Why they connect with only some of us? We may have karma with them. According to spirituality it is possible that these beings were part of our families, social lives etc in some past life that did not end well. If you don’t believe in spirituality or past life karma then here is the other reason- we became very weak mentally or spiritually as a result of a difficult situation and our own thinking patterns and became susceptible to attack by such forms. Why I am emphasising on karma is that there are many weak and disabled humans who never encounter any evil spirits in their lifetime. It is possible that this happens because they don’t have such past karmas.
Human nature- why did it happen in my case - my observation is this- I am very idealistic in nature and don’t go for survival even in difficult situations. I stick to the good principles and doing the right thing however sometimes it’s very challenging and causes me to be in vulnerable states. I also don’t ask for help easily. I am also very accepting of the universe and all beings. So the doors are open for all. I seldom think about protecting myself and care a lot about “others”. I have realised that this mentality leads to a mental and bodily potential which makes it easy for others to enter you or affect you easily. This is not a good thing and can create circumstances for harm to come to you- so self protection is very important. The demons connected with me long time (many years) ago when I was alone, not in a good place and not doing a job, although the manifestation of the “disorder” took time.
Early signs of schizophrenia
How they connected with me and how this transpired over many years? I have written about this in another Q&A here-
Ana's answer to Can you notice if you start getting schizophrenia? What are the first symptoms you experience?
Responsibility for schizophrenia-
The responsibility for our wellness always remains ours no matter what situation it is. I want to make it clear that I am not pushing the responsibility of my own mental illness on something else like demons. The responsibility is still mine. My practice of Vipassana has taught me that my mental patterns or tendencies alone are responsible for my condition or situation. And there is karma. Clearly I wasn’t strong enough, vigilant enough or aware enough or well enough in my good times to let something like this get into my consciousness. Now I have to suffer more. But I would like people to learn from my experience and be very vigilant about themselves so such harms don’t come to them. Because once this happens the challenges multiply.
Not seeing it as a demonic problem-
There is an advantage of not seeing this as a “demons problem” because it takes away the “fear” or “panic” this would cause and keeps the responsibility to our wellness ours which is important. It also protects our false “ego”. But truly it is only our karma - our own intentions, thinking, feeling or doing, our lack of vigilance that brings us such situations.
But knowing this phenomenon as external interference helps us see the problem in true light and solve for it accurately- it should give enough clues to science about what to investigate. For example mirror neurons and the content of voices should be investigated because I think that is at the basis of how all this transpires. Accepting the external agencies also removes a lot of the stigma attached to folks with schizophrenia.
Another important thing I feel is that schizophrenia surely has something to do with how we interact with “others”. There is something weak or erroneous about that causing this problem to manifest. It may helpful to retrospect or reflect on how our interactions with others are not mindful and put us in a weaker place. Are we forgetting about ourselves when interacting with others? Are we giving too much? Are we listening too much? Are we too empathetic or socially anxious. These are indicative of a weak neurological mental barrier that is weakening us creating opportunities for such entities to connect.
Self protection is key-
We have to stay away from negative vibrations and not be in low mental states for long, alone and without support. If you are aware of your weaknesses (being too nice, pleasing others, discounting yourself, not knowing how to survive, not taking care of yourself, not able to ask for help, low self esteem etc) it is important that you start working on them early on by finding paths of self realisation like yoga or meditation practises etc or going to a therapist and using psychology as a tool or getting social support- asking for help from a friend etc). It is important that you are strong and you look strong to others so others don’t take you for granted or harm you easily. We all have to be very vigilant about our present and past karmas.
Lastly, I am asking for your compassion for those who are suffering because schizophrenia is a very complex phenomenon and is not caused by mental craziness of any kind. This can happen to very good, capable, sane and rational people who have some neurological weakness (even high anxiety) which can be true for anybody these days and which may not have manifested yet. Please do respect the experiences of people with schizophrenia. What they say they are experiencing is true. This is critical in solving this social metaphysical neurological phenomenon.
About me
I wouldn’t have believed all this myself if someone came to me 3–4 years ago and told me. I had an old aunt (dead now, blood relation) who had once told me many years ago that beings visit her, she sees and hears them etc. But I did not believe her and tried to rationalise it to her logically how it was not possible. Relatives also mostly made fun of her. My siblings also have some symptoms of this disorder. I feel like I am not a typical case of schizophrenia because I was doing extremely well in life when this misfortune suddenly hit me- they just found me in the wrong place and wrong time, living alone - enough opportunity to do harms and experiment. I know this now because they are always hunting for others while connected to me. Now going through all this and so much suffering, I have to accept this unfortunate fact. I am very unwell now physically.",schizophrenia
435,"I’d say the simplest way to look at it is to think of it like dreaming or drug trip. What essentially happens in schizo is that one’s subconscious mind starts leaking into conscious reality.
As an example, if you dream that you woke up for the day and started getting dressed and what not, only to be awakened by your alarm clock and actually starting the day for real, well it is kind of like that. In that scenario, you aren’t consciously aware that you are still dreaming, it feels completely real.
Well in schizo it’s like one’s senses perceive information a bit incorrectly at times, and then their subconscious mind fills in the gaps. But since it feels real like a dream, they aren’t aware of it not being completely real so to them that is literally how they experience reality.
It is a bit more complicated than that from a clinical perspective, but in lay terms it is like when in a dream you can dream up an entire scenario with virtual people that you converse with, who seem completely real to you. Except there is no REM going on and it happens during waking hours instead of when they sleep. And what is “dreamt” aka hallucinated gets superimposed on normal sensory input data.
If you’ve ever been really tired, and thought that you saw or heard something that turned out to not be what your brain assumed it as, it’s a lot like that, but with schizo the “volume” as it were is turned up louder. And with paranoid schizo it’s a bit like a waking nightmare, but not all psychosis is paranoid.
Another easy way to look at it is to imagine for a minute that you had two radios. Imagine that one radio is the “dream world”/subconscious mind station, and the other radio is the “waking world”/conscious mind station. With a healthy mind, as one is waking up, the dream world radio starts getting the volume turned down, and the waking world radio gets turned up, to where you’re only able to hear the waking radio. With a schizo mind, the waking radio will play at normal volume, but the dream radio will also be turned on, making it harder to hear the waking radio. And if it gets too bad, the dream radio will be so “loud” as to drown out the waking radio. And it becomes incredibly hard to figure out which radio is blasting what information.
I realize from a neurological perspective, it is not quite 100% accurate of analogies that I presented. But the way I explained it is the simplest way I’ve come up with to give someone who has never experienced psychosis a frame of reference for understanding what it is like.
I’m not sure if this is the kind of answer you were looking for, but I hope that this is helpful.",schizophrenia
436,"Schizophrenia is a serious disorder which affects how a person thinks, feels and acts. Someone with schizophrenia may have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary; may be unresponsive or withdrawn; and may have difficulty expressing normal emotions in social situations.
Contrary to public perception, schizophrenia is not split personality or multiple personality. The vast majority of people with schizophrenia are not violent and do not pose a danger to others. Schizophrenia is not caused by childhood experiences, poor parenting or lack of willpower, nor are the symptoms identical for each person.",schizophrenia
437,"Here is how the National Institutes of Mental Health defines schizophrenia:
Schizophrenia
Overview
Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. Although schizophrenia is not as common as other mental disorders, the symptoms can be very disabling.
Signs and Symptoms
Symptoms of schizophrenia usually start between ages 16 and 30. In rare cases, children have schizophrenia too.
The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.
Positive symptoms: “Positive” symptoms are psychotic behaviors not generally seen in healthy people. People with positive symptoms may “lose touch” with some aspects of reality. Symptoms include:
Hallucinations
Delusions
Thought disorders (unusual or dysfunctional ways of thinking)
Movement disorders (agitated body movements)
Negative symptoms: “Negative” symptoms are associated with disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Symptoms include:
“Flat affect” (reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone)
Reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday life
Difficulty beginning and sustaining activities
Reduced speaking
Cognitive symptoms: For some patients, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more severe and patients may notice changes in their memory or other aspects of thinking. Symptoms include:
Poor “executive functioning” (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)
Trouble focusing or paying attention
Problems with “working memory” (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)
If you are trying to self diagnose, please don’t. As soon as you can please seek immediate support from your doctor who can direct you to the appropriate mental health support systems. It is a difficult disorder to diagnose but it is treatable.
Best of luck.",schizophrenia
438,"Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by 2 or more of the following:
1. Break from reality (psychosis) - not knowing what's real and what's not
- hallucinations: sensing things when they aren't really there: seeing, hearing or feeling sensations without actual stimuli
-delusions: rigid ideas or beliefs that have no base in reality, and are hard to contest. E.g., ""people are out to kill me"".
2. Disorganized speech: There are strange patterns of speech like making up new words or repeating randomly.
3. Disorganized behavior: Staying in one position for long, ritualistic movements without cause, excessive and irrelevant laughing or crying, reduced hygiene and self care.
All these should persist for a time period of more than a month. For such behaviors persisting lesser duration, other diagnoses on the psychotic spectrum are given - e.g, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder etc.",schizophrenia
439,"It is a mental disorder that is genetic, and is caused by excess levels of dopamine in the brain. The excess dopamine is what causes auditory and visual hallucinations (although the visual part is usually less common). People with this disorder often have delusions. Paranoid delusions are the most common, as well as grandiose thinking. Examples of paranoid delusions would things like ""the government is spying on me and out to get me"". The latter would be ""I am the smartest person in the world, and other people are simply lesser mortals."" It can be treated, effectively, with medication and therapy. Common medications include Latuda, Seroquel, Zyprexa, and many more. These medications work by reducing the dopamine levels in the brain, and they usually are quite sedating. These are newer medications and are anti psychotics. The first generation treatment usually was Thorazine. It works in the same way, but is incredibly sedating. It was often used in hospitals if a patient was violent, or disruptive. It will literally make you drool.",schizophrenia
440,"Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Heavy experiences on psychedelic drugs like LSD, DMT, or anything psychotropic can put people in a similar mind state that schizophrenic people experience and people usually feel more empathetic towards them after such an experience but is nowhere near comparable to the sheer agony an individual can suffer at the hands of this illness.
The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Medical researchers believe biological and environmental factors may contribute to the illness.
Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when symptoms have subsided. Treatment with medications and psychosocial therapy can help manage the condition.
The disorder affects slightly more than one percent of the population and is found to run in families.",schizophrenia
441,"Schizophrenia is a brain disease. It begins before birth. Symptoms do not usually show themselves obviously until early adulthood, because the earlier developmental errors are not ‘uncovered’ until a next stage of brain development: a normal optimization of the brain that occurs in young adulthood.
Schizophrenia is identified by specific symptoms - delusions, hallucinations. These must not be caused by some other medical issue or by substance abuse.
For a very long time, the patient also had to have some other rather unusual symptoms - what used to be called ‘The Four A’s’ - Alogia….um…I forget the other ones. We now refer to them as ‘negative symptoms,’ negative in the sense of ‘things taken away.’ Emotions, ambition, drive, planning….desire - to do anything. Emotions.
Most people do not realize that over 75 different neurological signs are associated with schizophrenia. There are a large number of cognitive symptoms as well. Children can show neurological signs like hemi-neglect and other unusual symptoms, even in infancy, even if their symptoms don’t become obvious until young adulthood. Physical clumsiness is very common for years before symptoms become obvious.
People who start to show obvious symptoms of schizophrenia early in childhood(like my brother-in-law) often show such severe hypotonia (low muscle tone) at birth that their little legs flop completely sideways. They very often show a drastic deterioration in posture right before onset of symptoms. Caregivers often describe how the child would lean against them even before their symptoms started.
Schizophrenia is genetic. Most people think that genes just ‘determine traits’ and then go to sleep. This is not true. Genes affect how we function every day. Genes are our basic source of information about how to develop prenatally, how to develop after one is born, how one functions day to day, and how one ages.
Schizophrenia is very often inherited. Nearly all the people I have known in the past 50 years who have schizophrenia, had a parent who had it. For a very long time, this wasn’t something people talked about. Mom and dad were just ‘divorced’ or ‘mom ran away’ or ‘dad went to a rest home’ or ‘dad never stayed in one place long.’ In the past, it was often said that the parent had ‘TB.’ This would explain why the parent was gone.
In fact, a study made some years back concluded that almost 90% of people who had schizophrenia knew of no relative who had it*!! I just love studies like that(sarcasm). They show a societal pattern, rather than informing us about the illness itself.
Because genes make mistakes sometimes, people do sometimes get schizophrenia without either parent having it. There are a couple possibilities there:
each parent has enough schizophrenia-like gene patterns that when they have children together, some of their children will have schizophrenia.
the parents had other disorders that are genetically related to schizophrenia, such as severe depression, bipolar disorder, etc.
as noted above, the offspring simply was never told about a schizophrenic parent or close relative, and they inherited schizophrenia.
a set of genetic spelling errors occurred when the offspring was conceived. A lot of research is going into what causes these spontaneous spelling errors. In most cases, ‘they just happen.’ But there are in fact ‘gene genes’ that affect how genes function - how slippery or sticky they are, which can affect whether they make coding errors when being copied.
the schizophrenia symptoms are caused by a medical disorder such as lupus, an ovarian tumor, dementia, etc. This is rare, but it does happen sometimes. Usually the doctor is tipped off because some symptoms she sees are not at all typical of schizophrenia, or there is a family history of these other medical disorders. Treating the underlying disorder, in some cases, will clear up the schizophrenia-like symptoms. In other cases both the underlying disorder and the psychosis need to be treated.
Schizophrenia doesn’t inherit in the percentages we find in those tidy Punnett Squares we learned in grade school. This is because schizophrenia involves multiple genes, not one gene, and is not about ‘dominant’ or ‘recessive,’ but due to much subtler ‘spelling errors’ in the gene code.
Have you ever tried to flip five coins and have them all come up ‘tails?’ This is basically how multi-gene disorders work. It’s ‘harder,’ statistically, to have the gene misspellings in multiple genes all turn out as needed to cause the illness.
If I have one parent with schizophrenia, my lifetime risk of having schizophrenia is around 14%. Yes, I told you since it involves multiple genes the numbers were going to be different!
What if I have two parents with schizophrenia? That risk takes a big leap up. 30–40%. How about if I have family loading(multiple close relatives have schizophrenia)? That risk goes up more.
How about if my identical twin has schizophrenia? This is a trick question. Identical twins are not genetically identical. Hang onto your hat…. your risk of schizophrenia if an identical twin has it is around 60%. That is precisely because identical twins are not genetically identical. And in fact, there are other genetic disorders that both identical twins do not always get.
What does that risk factor mean? Well, probably not what you think it means!
What it means is: “If I had 100 people who had one parent with schizophrenia, I can say that about 14 of them will get schizophrenia.’ And if I ask, ‘Fine, but WHICH people of that 100?’
Now you are going to see the limitations of that number. It’s a statistic, which means it applies to groups of people. Unless each person’s genetic patterns are studied in great detail, you can’t say specifically which of those 100 people will get schizophrenia. You can say ‘it’s gonna be about 14 people.’
*Many people who have schizophrenia have told me this, and then described a parent who was without any doubt, schizophrenic.",schizophrenia
442,"Schizophrenia is a type of mental illness that affects how the brain works. This leads to chronic problems with disordered thoughts and behaviors. It usually requires lifelong care and treatment. Researchers estimate that schizophrenia affects approximately 0.3 percent to 0.7 percent of people (between 3 in 1000 and 7 in 1000). Schizophrenia affects people from Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by continuous or relapsing episodes of psychosis. Those with the disorder experience distortions of reality, such as delusions, disorganized thinking, or hallucinations. Schizophrenia occurs in both men and women, of all ages. While men habitually develop symptoms in their late teens or early 20s, women develop theirs in their late 20s and early 30s. Also, while exact estimates are difficult to acquire, it has been estimated to affect about 1% of the population. There are a number of common misconceptions about this disorder. For instance, some people think it causes split personality. Whereas, schizophrenia and split personality (rightly termed dissociative identity disorder) are two different disorders. Some of the symptoms are Hallucinations, Delusions, Disorganized thinking and speech, Negative Symptoms, Decreased Emotional expression, Lack of interest in focussed activities.
Diagnosis of schizophrenia Diagnosis of schizophrenia may be carried out with the following:
Physical exam: To rule out other problems that could be responsible for the symptoms being displayed, and to also check for related complications.
Tests and screenings: To rule out conditions with similar symptoms of schizophrenia, and also screen for alcohol and drug abuse. Imaging studies, such as an MRI or a CT scan, may also be required.
Psychiatric evaluation: Mental health status is checked by observing appearance and demeanor, and inquiring about thoughts, moods, delusions, hallucinations, substance use, and potential for suicide. Family and personal history are also discussed.
CAUSES:
Family history and genetics
Environment
Viral infections like Herpes
Exposure to toxins like Lead, Gasoline, Paint etc. and neurochemicals
Brain and body risk factor
Lifestyle factos like stress and life changing events like deaths bereavements.",schizophrenia
443,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends.

444,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
445,"Some of the best books on schizophrenia are written by Dr. E. Fuller Torrey. He helped me understand my mother’s illness better than anyone. His sister also had it.
There is still much that is not known about schizophrenia. For example, while it apparently has some genetic components, not all identical twins both have it.
Scientists do not know what causes it, although there are many theories.
It is typically identified with severe psychosis, but it is very important to keep in mind that it is an illness that is not easily overcome. It is not the person’s fault that they cannot just “pull themselves up by their bootstraps.” Nor, is it the fault of the person’s mother as Freud often theorized.
Schizophrenia must be treated. Without treatment, the person can easily end up on the streets talking gibberish in the middle of winter wearing no coat for protection.",schizophrenia
446,"One of the main reasons that schizophrenia creates such problems, is that we don’t understand it very well at all. One of the main group of theories is that schizophrenia occurs as a result of a disorder in brain development, the results of which only become obvious later in life. In fact its become obvious that some subtle signs of neurological damage is often present well before the symptoms of schizophrenia are seen. Its thought that the symptoms reflect the nature and extent of the problems caused, though these problems effect the brain at the microscopic / molecular level. One of the main ideas and the basis for most drug treatments are problems in the neurochemical pathways in the brain, that use Dopamine, we already know that this theory is inadequate. This makes it difficult to identify the areas most effected.
Its sometimes thought that its not a single disease state but a group of disorders that present with similar symptoms. We know that the predisposition is heritable, though no single genes have been identified as either necessary or sufficient to cause it, in fact many hundreds of genes have been implicated. Currently its common to divide schizophrenia into the types that show mainly positive symptoms (things added), like hallucinations, delusions, problems in emotional control, over activity etc or negative symptoms, like withdrawal, low motivation, low volition, slowed thinking etc. Over time these two presentations seem to become much more distinct, those with negative symptoms appear much more difficult to treat and clearer evidence of brain damage can become more evident. Paranoia tends to be associated with a late onset and a much more specific set of symptoms.
The only way we can identify schizophrenia is by observing what people say and do, a lot of symptoms have very specific elements. Hallucinations are usually auditory and are of human voices, these may give a commentary of the persons behaviour, may echo the persons thoughts or make unpleasant value statements about them or might confirm certain delusional beliefs. Some voices may be perceived as commands and the person might feel compelled to obey them. People might a range of feelings that have no clear source, so they then look for possible reasons but can’t reality check effectively. When we try to make sense of things we generate lots of possibilities but almost instantly dismiss the least likely, a schizophrenic might simply accept anything that comes to mind, however unlikely. We have the ability to focus our attention on what is relevant, we can be in a party but attend to a conversation with a single person, this becomes difficult for people with schizophrenia so that everything around them demands the same attention, this overwhelms our ability to think. There are many other possible features and ways of eliciting them to make the diagnosis. The Drs will also look for evidence of other conditions that could explain some of the symptoms and treated.
There are lots of other ideas that might play a part in the development of schizophrenia and there is a strong association with other conditions like Bipolar disorder and autism.",schizophrenia

He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know.

For example, she could smell cigarette smoke and thought her twin brother was smoking when he wasn’t. She would hear helicopters that were coming to take her away. She would see people and dark shadows that made her shake with fear. During a psychotic episode she has trouble sleeping, eating and regulating her emotions. Anger is a very common emotion of the unmedicated schizophrenic. Unfortunately that is the only version you see in the media…the suicidal, homicidal, uncontrollable one. My daughter also has cerebral palsy and would never hurt a fly when she is healthy. When she is sick she gets angry at the disease and why she has to have it but doesn’t lash out at people. Relationships are very hard to maintain when you have schizophrenia because you are less likely to reach out to others and prefer to be alone. That being said she is never truly alone because of the voices that she hears in her head. The meds can help quiet them but they never fully go away for her. In a severe phase the voices become mean and try to command her to do things. I am so grateful for the medication that helps those who suffer from this very debilitating and unusually cruel mental illness.

Introduction
With schizophrenia and the schizophrenic disorders there is confusion in the patients’ minds about who they are, what they see or hear around them and this causes severe social problems for them.
Psychotic symptoms, delusions, hallucinations and bizarre behavior are more or less represented in each of these conditions. Subtypes of schizophrenia are described under various links.
Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder where the patient experiences a multitude of strange symptoms such as loss of contact with reality, false beliefs, false perceptions of sounds and images, abnormal thinking, reduced motivation and flat affect. As a result these patients, when untreated live in their own world, find it extremely difficult to communicate and to trust people around them, which makes it awkward for loved ones, friends and strangers to understand them. This leads then to social isolation, work disturbances and often marital conflicts and divorces. Secondary depression often sets in and frequently leads to suicide.
Statistical data about schizophrenia
The worldwide prevalence is 1%. Both men and women are equally affected with schizophrenia, however it starts earlier in men(peak is from age 18 to 25 years) than in women (peak is between 26 and 45 years of age). It is rare in childhood or early adolescence, but does occur in 4 to 10 children out of 10,000. First degree relatives of schizophrenic patients have a 10-fold higher incidence of schizophrenia than the general population.
Adoption and twin studies have shown that the major factor is the genetic component, but there is a significant environmental component, which is also effective.
Causes of schizophrenia
The exact cause of schizophrenia is not known, but there is a biological basis. The popular model at present is a vulnerability model, where there is an underlying minimal neurological vulnerability. On top of this come environmental stressors such as a broken marriage, leaving home to go to the army, moving to another town to find work, the loss of a loved one etc. , which then causes the brain metabolism to derail. Often the disease itself can feed into this negative cycle by causing loss of work or relationships and leading to homelessness and poverty. This will then tend to make schizophrenia chronic and very difficult to treat. Ref. 10 points out that there are different brain metabolic patterns for different subcategories of schizophrenia. The brain metabolism can be positively influenced by a knowledgeable specialist with nutrients rather than major antipsychotic medicine or nutrients can help reduce the amount of antipsychotic medicine required to control schizophrenic symptoms.
Schizophrenia
Among schizophrenics brain studies over the years have consistently shown some structural changes such as an enlarged ventricular system(= the fluid filled chambers in the center of the brain). Certain parts of the brain such as the hippocampus and the temporal lobes are smaller, but the basal ganglia are enlarged. This can be detected with imaging studies. The cerebral cortex in patients with schizophrenia tends to be small in size. With the help of the PET scanner, where brain function can be visualized such as glucose utilization, abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex can be shown in schizophrenics, but not in normal controls.

Author/Lance Dillinger",schizophrenia
453,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
454,"Schizophrenia is basically a mental disorder characterized by loss of contact with the environment, or unable to tell what is real from not. Schizophrenia has many types, including paranoid or catatonic schizophrenia. Schizophrenic people suffer from delusions and hallucinations and may range from mildly tame to grandiose, dangerous ones. The word “schizophrenia” is of New Latin origin.",schizophrenia
455,"Some of the other answers here are misleading. I am a mental health clinician and I specialize in schizophrenia, among other things.
If you are having unusual experiences which involves seeing and hearing things that others do not, then it would be a good idea to have this checked out by a mental health clinician.
Schizophrenia is the name for chronic psychosis. Psychosis is a symptom which includes hallucinations, delusions, and sometimes confusion, among a few other symptoms.
Hallucinations often, but not always, occur in the form of voices that a person hears as though they are coming from somewhere nearby. It is not usually possible to tell the difference between what is a real voice and what is a hallucination. Hallucinations can also be visual, tactile (touch), or any other sense.
Voices often, but not always, come in the form of persecutory and/or command. Persecutory are always putting you down. Command tell you to do something.
Voices are not always a bad thing. Some people hear helpful voices.
Delusions are like thought and belief hallucinations. A person is convinced that something is true when it is not, for example a person will believe that they're being followed by some people. They do not have any ability to understand that it may not be happening or that the beliefs are not true.
If you have the symptoms, there are treatments available to reduce their severity. Talk to professional mental health clinician to find out your options if you do have psychosis. Plenty of people live full and successful lives with good treatment.
I wish you well in your journey.",schizophrenia
456,"I cannot speak to schizophrenia.
But I can tell you that psychiatrists frequently misdiagnose, and the medications mask the symptoms of known illnesses, often for years, while the patient slowly grows sicker. They are brutally incompetent at what they do, and I would not invest much respect in their pronouncements.
Get to a real doctor before its too late.
I know this truth because I lived it.
I thought I would struggle to write this response, as I received the results of my biopsy results yesterday. It is a long, complicated and sensitive story.
I cannot cheat the details, so I apologize for the length.
This new diagnosis was a bittersweet moment, bringing a decade-long journey to end. I have a “significant” case of “small-fiber neuropathy,” meaning the fine nerve fibers in my hands and feet, and arms and legs are severely damaged.
This condition causes a lot of pain.
The pain causes anxiety, irritability and insomnia, which worsens the pain. It turns into a viscous cycle when not treated properly. One that affects your behavior.
(Because your nervous system regulates everything, it can also have an unknown impact on the heart, digestive system and the brain).
For me, the symptoms date back 12–15 years.
I am not completely sure about the timeframe. A psychiatrist had prescribed a stimulant medication. I remember my hands and feet started burning as if on fire. It hurt SO much. But it was also a mystery, not a known side effect.
My psychiatrist simply told me to stop taking the medication.
Burning extremities are a common sign of a neurological disorder, but he did not once question that possibility because psychiatrists are not obligated to rule out other possible causes. And there is no accountability for their mistakes.
While the medications masked the pain to some extent, they also made me sicker. In particular, the antidepressant Cymbalta, now prescribed for nerve pain too, masked the symptoms, but it gave me worsening depression and suicidal thoughts for years.
Once I stopped taking Cymbalta, I NEVER suffered from suicidal thoughts again. But I cannot count the years I lost to a psychiatric misdiagnosis.
There were many over the years, but the worst was Bipolar II.
For that, I was put on multiple classes of medications, and yet I . Just. Turned. Sicker. Slowly but Surely. Over the years, until…
There was a serious, suicide attempt in 2012.
Then, I had my first breakthrough.
At the hospital, I was approached by the state’s leading bipolar researcher about participating in a research study.
He was the first psychiatrist in twenty years to use any kind of official diagnostic tool. Using the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview), I spent two days and four hours with him, pouring over my life story. In the end, he declared me misdiagnosed Bipolar I or II.
This insight opened my eyes to the fraud we call modern psychiatry, and it sent me on a journey to unravel my relationship with it for good.
The tapering process took years, especially for Klonopin (a benzodiazepine - an addictive class of anti-anxiety medications).
But I finally made it, and I never went back.
During my benzo taper, my hands and feet started burning again.
This pain creeped and radiated, often so intense I described it as being sunburned from the inside-out. Like my whole nervous system was inflamed.
Through those years, I had argued I had the right to assess my baseline.
But, when I got to there, I found pain. Intense, physical pain.
Not a mental illness. I saw other doctors too.
Family practitioners. Pain specialists. And even neurologists. Not a single doctor mentioned small-fiber neuropathy as a possible diagnosis. I even had a nerve-conduction test, but the results were normal.
Then, I was writing about my pain experiences here on Quora.
Two months ago, someone contacted me. Someone with the exact same experience. He stopped taking Klonopin after many years. His hands and feet started burning. He was diagnosed with small-fiber neuropathy.
I had never heard of it, but I instantly knew I had it.
I researched it and learned the skin biopsy was the most definitive diagnostic method. I called my neurologist and asked for the test.
Now I know I have a serious case, as of yesterday.
But the emerging symptoms date back a good decade, misdiagnosed Bipolar II at one point, and masked by psychiatric medications, even though they made me so sick I was disabled and suicidal at times.
So what caused it?
Fifty percent of cases have no known cause.
Autoimmune disorders can cause it.
My doctors have dismissed this idea outright.
Alcoholism can cause it.
I’ve been sober for going on seventeen years.
Diabetes can cause it.
Nope. Don’t have it.
Neurotoxic medications can cause it.
It is the one thing I can pin it on.
We know it happens to cancer patients from chemotherapy. And I believe psychiatric medications can cause it too.
There is also an important book, Anatomy of an Epidemic, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in investigative journalism, that reaches a similar conclusion.
I took multiple classes over two decades, so who knows?
But I suspect Klonopin and antidepressants were the main culprits.
I do not have a better answer.
Psychiatrists must be held to higher diagnostic standards.
Beyond me, I have known two women misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder when they had Graves Syndrome. I have interacted with people who had cancer, misdiagnosed with depression, stalling life-saving treatments.
I have known two people misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, and they spent their lives in and out of mental hospitals. It is a controversial diagnosis, and it is quite possible you were misdiagnosed.
So, I would seek a second opinion.
And another.",schizophrenia
457,"How do you know they aren’t normal? Diagnoses are like rectums. Everyone has one. The DSM-V is bigger than a NY phone book. It lists thousands of diagnoses, and gets bigger every year. A huge industry has been built up around this.
We all have weird experiences. When I lie down to take a nap, I often “see” visual images and hear “things”. Semi dreaming. I often experience others as semi-demons. That’s where the mythology of demonology and religion come from. We do experience others, at times, as demons.
Life’s interesting and difficult. If you think you might want to kill yourself, you probably should seek some help or ask yourself why and work to change it.
If you decide to start seeing someone because you have “occurrences”, set some limits. There are many, many “therapists”, Psychologists and Psychiatrists out there who will be perfectly willing to “help” you as long as the dollars keep rolling in. Set limits.
And there are medications that will mask symptoms, you might need one. Or not.
Above all, don’t get totally invested in the “Mental Health” helping myths.",schizophrenia
458,"Honestly, I am not a psychologist and you should go into a therapy (or at least a consultation)…but, there are people that face this without being Schizophrenic.
Schizophrenia is more than just hearing a random word in your head (that happens to me all the time) cause that’s like remembering a memory from a decade ago for no reason (which happens to a LOT of people). Its symptoms range from delusions, memory loss, compulsive behavior to apathy, speech disorders, detachment, and hallucinations. NOW, don’t diagnose yourself…cause you can’t. There are even psych degree students who learn about these symptoms and find connections between themselves and mental illnesses they don’t experience.
Also, if you wanted a “fake diagnosis” from Quora repliers, you need to give information. When did they start? Were there other symptoms occurring that timeframe? Have they stood in the way of your daily life? Do you hear no voice, your voice, or someone else’s voice? Have you experimented with hallucinogenic drugs or painkillers? How long have your symptoms lasted? Have anyone around experienced the same because it may be caused some outside, natural occurrence (strong allergies, drugs given, insect or bug bites, etc)? Have you been sleep deprived for a long time or gone without sleep for two days straight regularly? What is your current social life? Do you want more interaction with peers, friends, or family? When was your last checkup? Do you take hormone or shots which have been known to cause changes in moods and brain chemistry? There are a lot more….but I’ll finish.
Just to end wrap it up, there are so many factors don’t automatically fall on the worst case or even the more dangerous scenario. Reach out to trained professionals, discuss with close friends/family, and STUDY facts and surveys around what you experience. Good luck.",schizophrenia
459,"I struggle mostly with suspiciousness, which psychaitry instantly labels “paranoia” and sensory overload. I sense and believe that I’m surrounded, watched, sometimes followed by many people or other beings, I often feel crowded and prodded with sights, sounds and touches. It’s very overstimulating and overwhelming and I usually question where things are coming from, why they are targeting me or why nobody else can perceive or sense these things. It’s stressful and isolating, because nobody else seems to share these experiences. I sometimes startle badly(even causing me to pull muscles in my neck) due to sudden, unexpected and at times unidentifiable sounds or by sensing I’m being touched by whooshing air, insects or fingers. These “hallucinations”(which I don’t think are actually hallucinations) don’t really scare me and I can usually just brush them off in little time, but it doesn’t stop them from causing me to startle or experience sensory overload, which in turn can lead to feeling agitated and unable to tolerate anyone being around me or talking to me.
At times I think all these things are part of a plot to drive me crazy, like some type of psychological experiment is being conducted, testing how I respond and I think there may be an interest in me specifically, because I’m not a Homo Sapien(but another type of human) and I’m considered a threat because of my ability to perceive things that some powerful people wish to keep secret. I’m never certain of this theory, unable to prove it even to myself . It’s hard to wrap my head around just what is happening and why. In any case, I don’t think I’m mentally ill. The more I get labeled psychotic and paranoid or get locked up in psych wards, the more I suspect that of also being part of some plot or gaslighting scheme against me.
I know that some of what I sense, perceive and believe is, in the opinion of others a sign of “mental illness”, so I must constantly put a lot of effort into “seeming normal”, only talking about what others think is “normal”. It’s an exhausting and estranging effort, which is why I try to be alone as much as possible, it’s the only time I don’t have to “pretend to be normal”. It’s been really hard lately, because due to the pandemic, my teen is at home with me 24/7 and although we have a very good relationship, I can't get much needed space and time to be alone and be myself for a few hours . I hide many of my thoughts and experiences from my teen as well, not wanting to worry her . At least the pandemic’s social distancing means I don’t have to be around any other people, which is helpful, enabling me to keep my stress levels lower than usual. I’ve not been hospitalised in 8 months now, which is a long stretch for me.
Edit: it's now been about a whole year since my last hospitalisation and for the past couple of months I've been doing very well, feeling more relaxed and secure than I have in a long time. Probably because I've been able to spend so much time in my safe home with just my sweet teen, barely ever interacting directly with anyone else. The balance is delicate though, as soon as I am obligated or pressured to interact directly with others, my anxiety, suspiciousness, stress, agitation are exacerbated, though not as severaly as before. I've had a lot of time to let my nevous system recuperate and strengthen, increasing resilience. I hope once the pandemic social distancing measures are relaxed and I’m expected to interact more, I will not take a sharp turn for the worse. I've actually been applying and enrolling in training programs to hopefully be able to work again in the near future. Things are looking up for now.
Edit 2024; I moved to Spain with my now young adult child(who in the meantime has moved to France) and have been able to remain hospital-free for nearly 5 years. Over the past two years, I completed a memoir about my experiences with the mental health system. Now, I’m just waiting to hear back from publishers.
.
People say l look mostly “normal” , when I am around them put in the effort, like in this selfie(I’m terrible at making selfies and I won’t let anyone else photograph me anymore)
But they don’t see me like this(being detained on Golden gate Bridge during a “psychotic episode”
Here are some drawings I made just doodles or sketches I made

461,"You clearly have sufficiently disturbing symptoms to seek professional help, which is the best way to reach an accurate diagnosis. It would be unreasonable to trust a guess, even by a seasoned professional, based upon a few symptoms shared over the Internet.
While your symptoms describe a distorted perception of reality that in broad outlines might be characterized as psychosis, not all such symptoms mean schizophrenia. One of the first steps in diagnosis would be a medical evaluation to rule out the many physical conditions that can produce similar symptoms. A few of the common ones would be drug toxicity, hyperthyroidism, Cushing’s Disease (excessive cortisol secretion), and tumors or infectious diseases of the nervous system. (I once encountered a patient who insisted that someone was following him, but the figure always appeared in his peripheral vision to his left. The patient turned out to have a tumor in his right occipital area, which mediates vision from the left visual field.) A physical and neurological evaluation together with a battery of blood tests and imaging studies (CT or MRI of the brain) would rule out most of these.
Dissociative disorders can also mimic schizophrenic psychosis. These may be based upon past trauma rather than an underlying biological imbalance, and they tend to respond poorly to medications and better to psychotherapy. Some clues may be hallucinations in more than one sensory modality (vs the auditory hallucinations that most frequently characterize schizophrenia) and at least some awareness of the unreality of the distorted perceptions. Correlation of the onset of symptoms with an identifiable traumatic event can be another clue.
A competent psychiatrist should be able to sort out the medical issues and come to a reasonable working diagnosis that would take into account all the presenting symptoms, including the perceptual distortions and the compulsive behaviors. Please seek help promptly so that you can find relief.",schizophrenia
462,"Schizophrenia is a diagnosis that can only be given by a qualified psychiatrist. As a diagnosis, it is generally useless to patients, except that it does tell you that a professional expert thinks there is something wrong with the way you behave. It also qualifies you to have health insurance pay for treatment if you have health insurance that pays for mental health treatments. Other than that, it is meaningless. It’s just a label that means something to experts. That doesn’t stop a lot of ordinary people from thinking they know what it means, but mostly they are wildly off in their understanding of what it means.
To heal from schizophrenia, it is necessary to understand the events you lived through and how they caused you to get into the habits of behavior you have that earned you the diagnosis. This takes a lot of talking about your past, especially about relationships with caretakers. You will be looking for experiences and your reactions to those experiences to see where you started behaving in ways characteristic of schizophrenics.
Then you’ll need to understand what is going on in your mind when you behave in these ways and you’ll need to practice seeing that you are doing these things at or close to the time that you do them. This takes lots of practice because it is really hard to notice what we do when we do it, and it is particularly hard to notice the feelings associated with these experiences. Often, we don’t have the words to describe these feelings, or even know how to describe our experiences, so that takes a while to learn and to get good at it.
Eventually, you get so you can notice what you are doing and feeling when you do and feel it. You can see what is triggering these behaviors. Then you can try to respond in different, more effective ways. Again, this takes creativity and practice — years and years of practice — in order to change the way you react to triggering events.
Along the way, you will probably discover that there are various different part of you, and many of them seem to work in counterproductive ways. You may find that you disagree with yourself, sometimes so much so, that you attribute parts of you that you disagree with to other people. It can feel like these other people have somehow invaded your mind. This can be really scary.
It works better to understand these other people as parts of yourself who think in very different ways from the self you identify as yourself. It helps to have a more expansive notion of self (even to think of yourself as a combination of selves). Then you can work to accept these different views of reality and different ideas about what to do, and integrate yourself into a more cohesive and cooperative whole. You can value your different parts and different internal points of view without feeling fractured or like you don’t know who you are. But this takes years of work and the development of compassion and kindness for yourself.
You can get help from therapists for this, but lots of therapists are more scared of schizophrenics and so they aren’t really helpful. The best help comes from others who have had similar experiences, but have managed to integrate themselves. There are emerging schools of psychology who believe in a more compassionate view towards people with schizophrenia, but they represent a small minority at the moment.
Healing from the splitting of selves that typically happens in people diagnosed with schizophrenia is a labor intensive process that takes years of work. It is probably work you will be doing the rest of your life. I say this to be hopeful, not discouraging. I say it to be realistic. The behaviors that get labeled as schizophrenia make it difficult for others to understand you and trust you. Learning to integrate yourself enough to be able to get along with others is challenging and time intensive work. But it is very doable. It just takes a long time, and medication is not a magic solution.
Medication might help provide some relief, but it just relieves symptoms. It doesn’t address the underlying problem. The only way to address the underlying problem is by this process of coming to understand yourself. Personally, I would skip the medication and go straight to the productive work. But everyone is different, and some people are in such dysfunctional shape that they feel a need to take medications that will numb them to the awareness of different aspects of themselves. If you numb those parts of yourself, you can’t integrate with them, so medication delays healing, but sometimes is necessary because the pain of awareness of the other selves is simply too much to bear. But I think that simply understanding the pain is bad, but it will be overcome if you do the work can be enough to bear it while you do the work. But everyone is different, and for some, medication can be useful.
In any case, first things first. See a psychiatrist if you want a diagnosis. But if you don’t care about diagnosis, and want to get started on healing right away, start going to meetings of people like you. There is an organization called Hearing Voices that runs support groups all over the country — maybe even all over the world. This is a great place to find others who share similar experiences, and it can be a great relief just to talk openly about what you experience with others who understand.",schizophrenia

If you hear a clear voice answering back to any of these questions you may have a condition. Here are some aspects to keep in mind.
Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling. People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment.
There are five types of symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, and the so-called “negative” symptoms. However, the symptoms of schizophrenia vary dramatically from person to person, both in pattern and severity.",schizophrenia
464,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
465,"It does sound like schizophrenia, yes. For advice refer to other answers. I'm not gonna give you advice, but I may give you hope.....
I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1997, and I've been on medication ever since.
The good news though, this doesn't have to rule you.
With the right meds, family and friends, I work a well paid full time job, and live in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend.
You've a lot of shitty times ahead of you, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I know, I walked all the way through it.
Good luck.",schizophrenia
466,"The main symptoms of schizophrenia are divided into two categories. Those being positive and negative symptoms. Positive would include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thoughts/speech. Negative symptoms would be lack of motivation, emotions, interest, and speech.
The best way to know for sure if you have schizophrenia is to get it diagnosed by a professional. I knew, though, that I had it a little before I was diagnosed. It was just called psychosis then, it was before I reached the six month landmark of having symptoms; once you have symptoms for six months, you can be diagnosed with it.
And absolutely you can be successful with it. I'm only in high school right now, but I've heard of plenty of people that are successful with it. I'm doing pretty well myself, but that's mainly due to therapy and medication. My plans are to go to college and gain a master's in political science. Hopefully that comes true.",schizophrenia
467,"That my life isn't over.
The images and voices seem real. I think they are real.
I can still live a somewhat normal life.
There are times where I distort reality.
I have never felt more alone.
During my psychosis, my hygiene is non-existent.
The suicide and substance abuse rate is 20 times higher for us.
It is hard to make friends.
You think everyone is talking about you, I mean everyone.
It's extremely hard to comes to term with a diagnosis.
Your life is forever changed.
I don't let it define me. I am stronger than that.
116 days sober, almost 4 months!!!",schizophrenia
468,"How real the voices sound.
When you read about “hearing voices” or having “auditory hallucinations”, the phrases kind of carry this meaning of “not real”. So you probably often think that if you ever “hallucinated a voice” you’d obviously know it wasn’t real.
The voices will shock you with their strange sentience and ability to come from outside your window or from passing cars etc. It’s the #1 reason why I believe it’s so hard to “have insight” about your condition as a schizophrenic. Because every waking moment you have these voices that are trying to prove to you with all their might that they are these omnipotent beings with powers you couldn’t possibly understand.
They will mimic your friends or family members and make it sound like the people who you loved and trusted actually hate you. As you walk past your brother in the hallway you’ll hear a voice (that sounds exactly like your brother and comes from the direction of his body) say “Fuck you asshole!”
I went to the funeral of my aunt and all I could hear was my family members telling me over and over again to “Go to hell” as I sat and stared between the cracks of the coffin and its lid to try and see if my aunt was really inside or if this was all some elaborately staged hoax.
It’s why when you first start hearing voices you suspect your neighbors and anyone around you. The voices can come from the wall that separates your room from your neighbor’s and it actually sounds like someone from the neighbor’s house is talking through the wall to you.
They don’t just repeat random things either (although they can and do do that as well), they can respond to things you say out loud or things you think about. I had an Apple Watch for several years, and whenever I would say to the watch “Hey Siri!” the voices would respond (coming from the watch) “Hey asshole!”
Last night as I finished blow drying my hair they said “Thank you for blow drying your hair” in a weirdly sarcastic tone.
Never in a million years would I have suspected a schizophrenia diagnosis. The only reason I even got one was because I had already been seeing a psych for depression and she got to sort of watch it unfold.",schizophrenia
469,"Thank you for your question.
One feature you describe sounds to me like illusions, rather than auditory hallucinations. Illusions are as you describe, thinking that something odd may be there, and the focus is often on how odd it is, and on whether it’s real or not.
The other feature sounds like something related to paranoia.
Both of these are also found in some people with schizophrenia.

For treatment, you might try a few things.
(1)
Did you start taking any medications or drugs recently? This could be a reaction to what you are taking. Mention these to the doctor who prescribed the medications and get them to adjust the dose.
(2)
Some physical illnesses sometimes include psychotic symptoms. Some cancers, for example, can be accompanied with psychosis. Get a medical check up and rule out or treat any physical illness that you have?
(3)
There are dietary sensitivities that some people have that can create psychosis. Wheat gluten, for example, can cause psychosis. To screen for gluten sensitivity, you’d stop eating all wheat gluten for a couple of weeks, and then challenge your body by consuming a lot of gluten quickly and see if the symptoms return. (You can try this with vegan meat substitutes that are made with wheat protein, for example, seitan). Other common psychotogenic ingredients include artificial colors, artificial flavors, and some other things.
(4)
It makes sense to cut out anything that crosses the blood brain barrier easily, like caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, etc. Cutting these out will give your brain a chance to regulate itself better.
(5)
Getting a lot of endorphins from exercise can help. You don’t see many marathon runners with major mental illness for example.
(6)
Spend time with people who care about you. Take on roles of responsibility in society, so that you have to care for others. This will give you skills to counter difficult emotions.
(7)
If you end up very anxious, you might try a brief dietary intervention of fatty foods. Two or three avocados, or half a pound of brie cheese can settle a person down after about 30 minutes. This is similar to the effect of an Ativan pill.
(8)
If symptoms get worse get yourself to a medical professional. The early onset period of schizophrenia can be challenging and potentially life threatening. Sometimes short term drug interventions are used to counter the symptoms, and settle a person down enough to function well. If you are put on medications, don’t go off of them suddenly, since that will trigger a relapse of symptoms. Instead, you’ll have to taper down to zero over a long period of time, even a few years, while at the same time living a very healthy life.
I hope the above helps! Good luck!
Disclaimer: The above is a recounting of my personal experience. I’m not a medical professional, and the above is not meant as medical advice. Schizophrenia is a potentially fatal illness. Trust yourself and seek medical care if you need to.",schizophrenia
470,"In 1991, my medical license was revoked for Axis I schizophrenia (chronic) without any allegations of malpractice when I was 40 years old making me life time unemployable. According to online psychology tests I have no mental disorders just an INFJ MBTI personality type. According to psychiatric theory I have active schizophrenia which has remained untreated and out of control for nearly 30 years. Drugs make schizophrenia into a chronic disease so right now there are ~4.5 times as many people disabled with schizophrenia as before Thorazine was started so be very careful. TLC is the very best care not drugs. Please watch at least all the videos I give you.

471,I have that problem too. No you're not crazy but there's people out there that want to make you think you're crazy. Are to drive you crazy. There is strange things happening . I had a stalker I thought I was going crazy and no one believed me. At the very end I contacted the police and they investigated and they told me ( you definitely have a stalker ). Even my hubby at the time didn't believe. My mom came and stayed with me and my stepdaughter they knew it real. My mail was stolen and opened and then put back in the mail box and that's how he got my phone number. I had to start carrying a gun otherwise I might not be here today. He even cut my phone line and that is what the phone company told. So ladies beware if you're too pretty they'll come after you. Beware of weirdos,schizophrenia
472,"the biggest truth you need to wrap your head around is that you cannot figure this out on your own. you need a professional or multiple professionals to come to a sound diagnosis and map out treatment plans and get your functionality back.
how can someone know if they have schizophrenia: they go to a professional who does a series of inventories to arrive at a differential diagnosis of schizophrenia. there may also be physical examination by a neurologist and a thorough consideration of history of head trauma, for example.
the symptoms of schizophrenia are spread out among the following:
positive (added to normal experience) symptoms…hallucinations, delusions
negative (something subtracted from your experience that is present in most people’s experiences) symptoms…avolition, anhedonia, alogia, (selective) mutism, flat affect
disorganised symptoms (these are bizarre or incongruent behaviors). formal thought disorder is a big one and I've dealt with that. I deal with that, I guess…it’s not entirely resolved or anything. inappropriate affect, bizarre behavior or comportment.
it can include an affective quality…for straight schizophrenia, most of us don’t have a standalone depression diagnosis, but we’ve endured post psychosis depression…which really might just be negative symptoms…there’s considerable overlap between the two.
so that’s why you need a professional, by the way. you can’t diagnose yourself properly because you don’t know how to differentiate the finer points of diagnosis. and they have the expertise and experience needed.
anyway, last facet: cognitive issues…these can be aided by cognitive remediation therapy, but cracking repeatedly takes a toll on your brain and you end up slower or suffering from brain fog.
hope that helps…but, seriously, find a professional.",schizophrenia
473,"The hallucinations (seeing things that are not there and hearing sounds that only exist in your imagination) and delusions (false beliefs that people want to harm you) are symptoms of psychosis, experiencing psychosis is not necessarily a sign of schizophrenia as many things can trigger psychosis including depression and drugs, but the fact that you pick cups and return them and you have to go back to step over a leaf makes me think you might also be dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder, the best thing you can do is seek proffessional help for diagnosis and treatment, when seeking proffessional help mention all the symptoms because they are all important in diagnosis and might point to more than one illness, also if you are put on medication please take them, usually they can help you return back to a normal life.",schizophrenia
474,"If you really want to know if you are schizophrenic, then you have to see a psychiatrist. You also have to buy into the psychiatric understanding of humanity. That means seeing yourself as “sick” or “disordered” if you get a diagnosis of schizophrenia. That means taking medication that will prevent a part of your mind from working normally in order to suppress the experiences that get you labeled as schizophrenic. You’re welcome to do that if you want. However, I think it will lead you into a world of hurt.
People who buy into the psychiatric view of humanity tend to end up with a great deal of difficulties. They are stigmatized for having a disorder. They are medicated which has many side effects and can cause people to think and speak slowly and cause their fingers to shake, and cause them to need all kinds of medications to deal with side effects. Plus, it never really makes them feel like themselves. At best, it can make it so people can not stand out as being weird, which might make it easier for them to get along with others. But it has a huge cost in terms of being who you are.
For some people, being able to get along with others is a trade-off worth making, even if they aren’t themselves. For others, it can make them worse — even causing people to commit suicide. It’s impossible to know in advance whether you will be able to live with the consequences of psychiatric intervention.
There are alternatives to the psychiatric approach. If you want a less stig...

475,"This is not really one of those “I might have this” situations. A lot of medical disorders come with vague symptoms that may or may not be present for the majority that have the condition. Not so with schizophrenia. Psychosis quickly consumes your entire life, and you start living according to something that cannot possibly be real.
It’s almost like your reality testing mechanisms are not operating. You don’t notice that your thoughts are starting to become so out of line with literally anyone else’s, it’s difficult to have conversations with people about anything normal. At that point it seems prudent to turn inward, into this reality you’ve so carefully constructed, that no on else seems even capable of understanding. If you try to share it is usually in short bursts—situations that can and do easily spiral out of control. It’s not even clear why that happens, you just know it usually does with so called “normals”.
Looking back, it seems so gravely evident that something was entirely amiss upstairs, for years. But at the time it just felt so real, it was too difficult to divorce myself from the situation and take a step back. “This is not normal. You are living on the street, talking to yourself, eating from trash cans. What did you expect would happen moving to a strange city with $3000?”
I wasn’t talking to myself. That was my defense. For years. I wasn’t just talking to myself, I’m telepathic. People can hear me. Certainly the person I was talking to, or at least part of their mind, was reacting to my words. But where is the evidence of this? You’re the leader of the world, but no one cares about you enough to give you a place to live? People suck. Was my answer. This cannot work the way he expects it to, that would be a path outside of alignment with the interests of society as a whole, to have this path through utter non-sense to a meaningful life. So just as easily the world turns against you. Not the whole world. Some of the most powerful actors on the planet, this is Los Angeles.
Telepathy has been around in some form for hundreds of years. It’s a closely guarded secret in certain aspects of society: law, medicine, government. No one wants these people to be insane. But if you follow the money, it would be insane not to. Democratizing access to these technologies is the next logical step.
Take music, for example. That’s a form of mind control. Making people think certain things with certain combinations of frequencies repeated in their brains. It doesn’t work on everybody, but with the masses it can be quite powerful. If people became aware of this, a power structure would develop between artists in the same genre, competing for viewership.
Expand this to any form of structured thought or discourse. Where many people have had the same education for hundreds of years: law or medicine. Doctors and lawyers have long been recognized as experts in their fields. But to be an expert physician, or an expert lawyer, is something else still. But not something entirely different, after all, all physicians are experts at something.
What if, long ago, structured legal and medical thought led to huge conglomerates of legal and medical knowledge, indexed by then-current experts in their fields. Libraries of human medicine and legal practice, gatekeepers to which would be their oath or call to the bar. Once this is completed, their mind gains access to 100’s of thousands of man-hours of labor, cataloging, filtering, the very thoughts of doctors and lawyers all over the planet. This could already exist, and nobody talks about it because it would sound insane. But that would explain how they think. Perhaps I'm envisioning a future, where truly telepathic technologies bring us to a point where we have to consider database architecture in structuring professional knowledge this way. That’s an interesting concept to consider.
See how the psychosis, or elements of thought developed during psychosis, can seem real enough to discuss as though it is reality? I can look at those thought patterns now and see where I might be veering too far from acceptable perception to be accepted outright as more than just the ramblings of a crazy person. Basically the moment I mentioned telepathy, that flag goes up. *This might not be real.*
And that’s how you have to think. Could this be real? Censoring all your thoughts this way can be awfully tiring. But it has to be done, and leads to a poverty of thought. What’s left over might not be enough to structure a normal conversation around. Not to mention the medication which prevents free-flowing thought and comes with a host of side-effects.

So here's wht you should do
Get yourself an appointment to get diagnosed!
So that you can either save yourself from unnecessary stress or get yourself to be treated or medicated.",schizophrenia
477,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.
Source: Schizophrenic, currently off my meds (I should be on meds, I will decide based on my symptoms) and working a nice high paying job. I intend to write a book about my experiences and monetize it. I have what is called “awareness” I know that I am sick. Many schizos are not as lucky as I am. The “paranoid” type of schizo, seems to leave mental reasoning and faculties intact. I still have my radio detection device, my brass helmet (to guard against radio waves etc.) and other countermeasures. At the time it all made perfect sense. How am I dealing with it? Well I have a schizo friend who says there is no upside to it, everything is terrible. I disagree. If and when I choose to make my illness public, I will have the ultimate excuse. And I have an excuse to be lazy, to not shower, to not cut my nails. It’s fucking great. I am taking ownership of my schizo, and will probably publish a book about it. By the way, delusions of grandeur is another symptom of schizophrenia.
Take care and good luck… one of the main ways people “recover” from schizophrenia is to help others. Problem is not everyone is the helping type, and not everyone needs help. I will see who I can help in this life, but first I have to look after myself. And make the most out of the time I have, because life expectancy of a schizo is 15 years less.",schizophrenia

480,"For the majority of people , subacute symptoms or prodromal symptoms start around the age of 15 or 16. You may start having less motivation or less initiative than you had previously, for instance you may not feel like playing basketball anymore or singing in the girls choir and you don't really know why, you may have interrupted sleep or start to sleep more than usual and your appetite may change. You may start having thoughts that seem odd or bizarre, that you don't dare tell anyone, or you may start coming up with some really wild ideas, for instance you may start thinking more about religion , space, infinity etc. You begin to notice that you hear everything at the same decibel, like people's voices, the fan, the clock ticking so its helpful if you spend more time away from people so it won’t be so loud. You may see flashes or lines out of the corner of your eye. You may hear your name being called but when you turn there is no one there. Sometimes people can get scared that other people are talking about them in a negative way, or watching them or putting things in their food . During this time you know your thinking might be off but you can't figure out why you are thinking this way- in other words you still have insight . Without getting help at this early stage your insight slowly disappears and you start believing your thoughts more and more over time. At some point if you go without treatment you are unable to tell what's real and what's not real.

481,"I can only answer this from the point of view of a mother of a son who has schizophrenia. I first noticed a deep, dark depression, worse than any depression he’d ever had. He withdrew from everything and everyone, wouldn’t answer phone, texts or emails. Then he lost his girlfriend and job. His girlfriend told me she thought maybe he was manic or something. He routinely posted gibberish on facebook, phrases that didn’t make any sense and often with made-up words. Next, his roommates kicked him out because he couldn’t pay his rent. I brought him home and that’s when he went completely psychotic. He told me his thoughts got blocked, that he was hearing voices and his behavior had just become totally erratic. He would get lost when he left the house. He became unable to function in the real world. He agreed to go to the ER and he’s been in therapy/on meds ever since. He exhibited most, if not all of the classic symptoms of the disorder.",schizophrenia
482,"It’s definitely gonna vary from person to person, so I can only speak from my own experience.
Usually what I’ll notice at first is increased anxiety and obsessive thought. Now this one can be kind of tough to spot because I’m already quite obsessive and anxious. But if I notice I’m starting to question things far out of the norm, then I see it as a warning sign.
For instance, if I begin to sift through memories looking for inconsistencies in the fabric of them it’s a sign. If I begin to question reality, it’s because I’m slipping. It can be quite tough because all logical thought is slipping away from you. You aren’t thinking through things step by step. Your taking leaps and stumbling all over the damn place with your reasoning. You take something like a lack of birds chirping in the morning as a sign that your whole life is a tv show.
Next is the emotional differences. Some people lose their emotion during psychosis, and that happens to me only at the very peak of the episode. Before then there is this rising fear and paranoia that I can feel inside me. Not just fear about walking down a dark hallway, I believe that while that’s irrational, it’s not quite psychotic. I’m talking like refusing to eat or drink because you believe the government is poisoning your food and trying to kill you.
Now if your trying to see if a family member is going through psychosis, my mom once told me that I’m like “a cornered cat” 24/7.
Again that’s only my experience with it.",schizophrenia
483,"Schizophrenia is a challenging disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally.
In some people, schizophrenia appears suddenly and without warning. But for most, it comes on slowly, with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning long before the first severe episode.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia
In this early phase of schizophrenia, you may seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive to others. You may start to isolate yourself, begin neglecting your appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. You may abandon hobbies and activities, and your performance at work or school can deteriorate.
Most common early warning signs include:
Depression, social withdrawal
Hostility or suspiciousness, extreme reaction to criticism
Deterioration of personal hygiene
Flat, expressionless gaze
Inability to cry or express joy or inappropriate laughter or crying
Oversleeping or insomnia; forgetful, unable to concentrate
Odd or irrational statements; strange use of words or way of speaking",schizophrenia
484,"below are some early warning signs of schizophrenia:
Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating
Suspiciousness or uneasiness with others
A decline in self-care or personal hygiene.
Spending a lot more time alone than usual.
Strong, inappropriate emotions or having no feelings at all
Signs Of Early Or First-Episode Psychosis:
Hearing, seeing, tasting or believing things that others don’t
Persistent, unusual thoughts or beliefs that can’t be set aside regardless of what others believe
Strong and inappropriate emotions or no emotions at all
Withdrawing from family or friends

485,"If you go after Emil Kraepelin, a German doctor shizopphrenia has 4 stages
The first stage is shown by retreat and colapse of the social environment.
The second stage is shown by Paranoia which manifests in feeling followed or just the feeling that people constantly talk bad about you.
The third stage is shown by not responding to emotions people would expect you to like f.e. laughing when you actually should cry and you articulate incorehently.
The people who are in the fourth stage repeat actions all over again for hours, f.e. looking at the wall and saying a name or something like that.

486,"In the initial phase, they can experience that everything that is happening around them is directed towards them and have a sinister meaning. Then, they become withdrawn and become suspicious towards people around them. They start talking about some odd beliefs for eg. they have supernatural powers, there is some conspiracy going on to kill them etc. They start experiencing hallucinations, commonly auditory hallucinations where they hear some noises or voices. There are other forms of schizophrenia where patients thought process may be jumbled up and speech may be incomprehensible. Because of above preoccupations there job performance/academic performance/family and social life gets disturbed.",schizophrenia
487,"I had the opportunity to be a member of a team of researchers that identified and treated early onset psychosis - either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychosis before the brain converted into full psychosis. The symptoms that people first develop are not the same as the symptoms that people who are having an acute first episode. Onset symptoms are called PRODROMAL or Subacute ( the period before) . During the study we treated individuals between the ages of 12 and 25 over 10 years. The average age of onset of symptoms was 15.8 for males and 15.6 for females. All of our clients noticed that something wasn't right in the way they were thinking and or feeling. They knew something was changing but didn't know what or why. They didn't have a good reason so they would try to make one up mostly for their parents sake.
A classic example : 14 year old male with history of grandmother with paranoid schizophrenia. Always has been outgoing at school, A student , sometimes A few B’s , plays soccer , runs track and plays ultimate frisbee in the Spring . Has a big group of friends and enjoys spending time with his family which includes 2 older brothers , also in high school.
Stressor: a recent refusal 2 weeks ago by a girl to the dance with him. This really hurt his feelings. Grandfather who he was close to passed away 2 months ago. Since then his sleep and appetite have been off. He has missed soccer practice 4 times, and didn't show up to his game this past Saturday because he was “ tired”. He hears a slight buzzing outside that won't go away and he swears someone is whispering his name at class just to bug him. Because when he turns around no one is there. He thinks maybe he is imagining it and he just needs more sleep. He has been staying in his room while he has been at home because every time he sees his brother Jack , Jack’s face elongates . He also got a C on a test this week because he it was just to difficult to understand all of the material he was suppose to know. . He doesn't understand what is happening but knows that it is strange and he wants things back to normal.
This is an example of a typical onset and a client that we would enroll into the study . As you can see the symptoms are there but it depends who is looking and what they are looking for . Pulling away from activity , decline in grades and isolating from family were classic prodromal negative symptoms that clients shared.
I hope this was helpful.

488,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health condition characterized by a range of symptoms that affect thought processes, emotions, and behaviors. The symptoms are generally divided into positive, negative, and cognitive categories.
1. Positive Symptoms
These are symptoms that add abnormal experiences or behaviors:
• Delusions: Strongly held false beliefs, such as paranoia (thinking others are out to harm them) or grandiosity (believing they have special powers).
• Hallucinations: Sensory experiences without external stimuli, such as hearing voices (most common), seeing things, or feeling sensations that aren’t real.
• Disorganized thinking and speech: Incoherent speech, difficulty staying on topic, or talking in a way that doesn’t make sense.
• Abnormal motor behavior: Unusual movements, agitation, or catatonia (lack of movement or responsiveness).
2. Negative Symptoms
These involve a decrease or loss of normal functions:
• Flat affect: Reduced emotional expression or showing little to no facial emotion.
• Avolition: Lack of motivation to engage in activities or carry out daily tasks.
• Anhedonia: Inability to feel pleasure or enjoyment from previously enjoyable activities.
• Social withdrawal: Avoiding social interactions and isolating oneself.
• Alogia: Limited speech output or difficulty in conversation.
3. Cognitive Symptoms
These affect memory, attention, and decision-making:
• Impaired memory: Difficulty retaining or recalling information, especially working memory.
• Poor concentration: Struggling to focus or maintain attention on tasks.
• Disorganized thinking: Trouble planning, organizing, or making decisions.
Early Warning Signs
Before schizophrenia fully manifests, some individuals may show:
• Social withdrawal
• Decline in personal hygiene
• Unusual or irrational beliefs
• Increased sensitivity to sensory inputs (sounds, lights, etc.)
• Trouble sleeping or changes in sleep patterns
• Sudden academic or work performance decline",schizophrenia
489,"This is a really good question.
I read a book called, “Schizophrenia Healed”. It was by a British man who had been hospitalized several times. He got saved and through prayer, effort, and years, his doctor said that he showed no signs of the illness.
He said that of the schizophrenia patients he knew they all seemed to manifest symptoms at 20–22. Why that particular age I don’t know. Maybe because the body is totally done with growing and it changes your emotional perspective? Not sure.
Of the family members that have the illness it did seem to manifest at that age. Before that they showed symptoms of apathy which was mistaken for depression. However at the age of 22 it was as if their perception of reality changed, and they never got “right” no matter how many medications and counseling.
In the British guy’s book I mentioned there was a component of rejection. His mom never wanted a boy. His relationship with his mom was also a source of anxiety for him. Whenever he had to go see her he would get severe depression afterwards and would need to be monitored closely.",schizophrenia
490,"So I think the trick part of this question is the word “ normal”. There are many people who have schizophrenia who are considered very normal by, say, their co workers. Of course their co workers are not administering a psychiatric evaluation that would give the interviewer information into the person’s mind and would be indicative of how someone with schizophrenia thinks. They would not be privy to the information that the man actually believes the whole lunch room hates him, has stolen his lunch for past 2 years because he wears purple on Thursday and the FBI is watching him beside where he parks his car and follows him home every day. He simply goes his work, smiles, does his work, doesn’t mention any of his problems to anyone, and leaves on time. This “normal “ person has schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
491,"Based on my experience as a mother of a young man who began to show signs of psychosis around the age of 17, and with the benefit of hindsight, I would say that signs are there from early childhood that might (“might”) result in a schizophrenia diagnosis years later. In my memoir The Scenic Route, I discuss the following possible signs in detail:
solitary - does not run with “the pack” ; may prefer company of one friend only; does not “engage” others
interest in fantasy - e.g. literature, fantasy video and card games
prefers to let others decide for him/her (difficulty making choices); this can be construed as a form of apathy
altruistic by nature
ghostlike (pale, quiet, uncanny way of slipping into a room without being noticed)
May develop severe acne in the teenage years. (Dr Abram Hoffer made this observation)
Winter birthdate (Dec. 21 - March 20) (for nothern hemisphere)",schizophrenia
492,"Signs of schizophrenia generally occur between the ages of 16 and 30. It’s rare for anyone to be diagnosed with schizophrenia after the age of 30. The first signs are auditory or visual hallucinations and psychotic episodes may occur frequently during the course of a lifetime.
There are three stages for the disorder, the prodromal or beginning stage, the acute or active stage and finally, recovery or residual phase.
Schizophrenia is difficult to diagnose in the early stages and requires the attention of a professional.",schizophrenia
493,"Everyone has different symptoms when first developing schizophrenia, so my symptoms might be completely different than someone with the same diagnosis. However, I will still state what happened to me.
For the first time in my life, I was tired. I was 14 years old. Before this, I could wake up for school and stay awake. I wasn’t quite a morning person, but I had no trouble staying awake after getting out of bed. This suddenly changed. I would be in class, and my eyes would start rolling in the back of my head without me even closing my eyes. I’d have microsleeps all day despite getting a full night of sleep. It felt terrible. I was constantly exhausted no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.
My feelings toward my family suddenly changed. I felt that they were against me in some way, I’d constantly argue with them. I was always on edge around them, I was afraid they would hurt me. This fear lead to me hating them for a bit, sadly.
I developed very odd rituals. If I did not throw ice cubes into my pool, I would die. Every time I went onto my back patio, ice had to be thrown into the pool.
I loved being alone during this time. I looked forward to being home alone, but once I was actually home alone, I still felt as though there were people there. I’d walk around the house asking who was there. I looked for cameras, as I thought my parents were trying to catch me doing something I was not supposed to do. I would look up at the ceiling and say things like, “I know you’re there.” “Stop recording me, I know what you’re doing”, ect.
I had what I called my “emotion breaks”, which were little voices that would pop into my head. If they said something mean, I’d think it was my anger trying to talk to me. If they said something happy, I’d think it was my happiness trying to talk to me. I believed that my emotions had come to life in my brain, and they were talking to me.
I had very odd moments of confusion. I would be doing my normal thing, like homework, and suddenly, my brain would shift. I would very suddenly believe something very strange. For example, one time I thought that there were secret tunnels in my house that lead to the mall, I thought I had to find them to get to the mall. I would get up and look for them, wandering around my house, then I would think myself out of it. I would start having rational thoughts, like “Have I ever seen the inside of these tunnels before?” “Wouldn’t I know where the entrance was?” “I thought I got to the mall by car” Then I would realize, after a few minutes, there really aren’t any tunnels.",schizophrenia
494,"There is a debate that schizophrenia can’t be presented in children under the age of six. There is proof of children having it younger than that age. It was thought that they couldn’t hallucinate. HA! There are several families and cases of families that have documented cases with their children. There are two young ladies who are in prison right now because they presented with schizophrenia at the age of 12 and it was easier for a jury to think of them as not being mentally ill, just evil than to think that if they had just been diagnosed earlier the little girl they hurt would still be without her worst nightmare. Of course there will be a huge community who will say I’m full of bull shit.",schizophrenia
495,"Some people with a really high genetic loading may have symptoms from a very early age. Since it is considered normal for children to have imaginary friends, a diagnosis is not commonly made in very young children. Adolescents are also expected to behave inappropriately, but when they go past a certain point, some are diagnosed and begin treatment between 10 and 18. There is a big increase in diagnosis at around 20, when society starts to expect a person to start becoming 'responsible'. There are also people who do not start having symptoms at all untill they experience some sort of trauma or stress. The stress of being suddenly on their own may be responsible for many of those who are diagnosed beginning to have symptoms. It is hard to guess how many people have symptoms for years before being noticed, and how many are exposed to stress or trauma that triggers the beginning of symptoms.",schizophrenia
496,"To all readers,
When you feel depressed.
You want to be alone more without reason or unable to get well without others without reason.
You feel you start day dreaming a lot and very realistic without reason usually either anything fantasy or past memories (it's ok in love, about family, occassion, future or any worry
This are starting phase before anything really to start in schizophrenia.
Later all anger, sadness, loneliness and darkness takes shapes.
So always try to be good and stop being jealous about anybody for any reason. Jealousy is good in drama or movies, in real life a jealous person is only a problem and reason of sin in other's life too.
Always have time and act for yourself in freetime apart from social media, even if you hate it and body is not ready. Never expect compliments in return , please . Do it for yourself and happily.
You're priority and you're important in your life , first.
Do everything for yourself and act kind to others.
Thank you

497,"First, I was just answering my thoughts with my own thought, meaning I had an active conversation with myself; it seems normal at first. Then, strangely, I hear the radio or TV seem to be talking about me (or at least I suspected it was about me). This seemed to just go away at first, with 2–3 week intervals, and then it became a week, and then just days apart. I was actively having a discourse in my head. Well, it must have made me think that I was on to something different that just a handful of people on Earth have, so I kept this to myself. This made it difficult to turn back at this point. I guess it’s just the way it works. Our brains trick us into believing something that just isn't “normal”.
There were also times early on when people I didn’t know really did seem to know me; I mean, I hear them talk about me, which I just brushed off. Strangely though, they seem to know what's going on in my head. One time a mad man cursed me in the street, saying that I should stop what I’m doing or we're all gonna die! Just crazy you know, so this got me deeper and deeper into my insanity.
Sometimes when I looked at people their faces seemed bent, and so I just ignored all of these. In the early stages, I think the best thing to do is to have a healthy conversation with a “real” friend, and to visit a psychiatrist.",schizophrenia
498,"As a forensic psychologist who worked in State hospitals for decades and diagnosed patients for legal purposes (such as civil commitment) I think I am qualified to answer this question.
People who suffer from schizophrenia may show some signs early in life - extreme shyness, social insecurity as well as a kind of emotional rigidity - but overt symptoms such as paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations typically emerge in late adolescence and early adulthood. Interestingly, in women, the development of symptoms may emerge much later, even in middle age. There clearly is a genetic role in schizophrenia, as first degree family members often demonstrate the same brain anomalies as the person who suffers from schizophrenia but may or may not develop the symptoms.
Schizophrenia is now understood to be a “spectrum disorder,” like autism. The sufferer may have a severe case or a mild case and everything in between, and the severity of symptoms may vary widely over time. “Antipsychotic” medications may help to ameliorate some “positive” symptoms, such as hallucinations and florid delusions, but typically the patient will continue to demonstrate “negative” symptoms such as social isolation and paucity of speech. Positive symptoms frequently return because the patient has stopped taking the medications due to unpleasant side effects - obesity, metabolic syndrome, etc. - or because the symptoms are no longer present so the patient quite sensibly thinks, why keep taking these terrible meds if the disease is gone? This is the most frequent reason for re-hospitalization.
Anyway, the simple answer to your question is late adolescence and early adulthood, but there is of course tremendous variation. Some research indicates that if you can see the signs earlier and begin treatment, the outcome will be better.
I could write for a long time about his question but I hope this helps….",schizophrenia
499,"I'm aware but when I look at other people's lives who think they're not “crazy” I often wonder who really is the crazy one. I'm not obese, I'm not addicted to porn or TV or any kind of screen, my credit score is damn near 800, my body is not for sale online or offline, I'm not begging some man to be his other woman, I'm not pretending cheating is love for years, I'm not sleeping with random strangers every weekend. Please have your shit together before you feel emboldened to call someone else crazy. I would remove myself from the earth plane if I had to trade lives with most of the people who think they're better than me. Neurotypicals are hardcore delusional. There's a surface world of appearances and lies they cling to and then there's how they really are and how the world really is. If you dont cling to the cliches and stereotypes, you're “crazy”. If you dont have a mind and personality shaped by TV, TikTok, and other people's opinions/ traditions, you're crazy. I'd rather believe in magic than believe half the things fake, empty inside, mindless automatons believe. So sure. I know I'm crazy. But it doesn't mean someone else who isn't “crazy” is having a better life. Stay in your place, muggles lol",schizophrenia
500,"Schizophrenic people are not crazy for one. That is simply a stigma. It is highly offensive to people suffering with schizophrenia. I have psychosis, and many other symptoms of schizophrenia and I’m well aware. I’m not self diagnosing, however I have 3 schizophrenic friends, and none of them are crazy. Are they aware of their schizophrenia? Yes, they are. Are all of them aware? No, not all, but I’m pretty sure the majority of them are. Please don’t call them crazy, it’s highly offensive. They are struggling with a real illness, we wouldn’t call a brain cancer patient crazy, now would we? Schizophrenic people aren’t crazy despite what people say.",schizophrenia
501,"Yes, people with schizophrenia can know they have schizophrenia. The major hurdle is overcoming the denial about having the disease. A person with schizophrenia might know that things aren’t right, they might go to a doctor and get diagnosed, but the delusions associated with the disease can make it hard to accept having the illness. On the one hand, you have your brain telling you that everything is a huge conspiracy and that the doctors are really secret agents, and on the other hand you have doctors and family telling you you have a severe mental illness, so it is hard to figure out which scenario to believe.
However, when someone is medicated it is much easier to know that you have the illness, but it is still hard to accept that such an awful disease is happening to you. Then you have millions of dumb internet trolls talking about how schizophrenia isn’t real or how you can cure it with vitamins and exercise, so of course someone would want to believe they don’t really have this horrible disease.
That is why many of us who have mental illness, schizophrenia in particular, feel it is important to be open and share our stories about having schizophrenia. The stigma surrounding the disease creates problems in addition to the disease itself, but we CAN do something about the stigma by speaking up.
It took me a long time to really accept my illness, and I’m quite sure I wouldn’t have ever fully accepted it if I had not had medications. The delusions can be quite strong. But, yes, I would say most people with schizophrenia know on some level there is something wrong. It is a long road to acceptance sometimes.",schizophrenia

503,When I was in psychosis I didn't know.. I just believed I was being gangstalked and assaulted. I just had to get proof though I never could. It wasn't until a few visits to the psych ward and a general doctors appointment where I got the diagnosis and even then I didn't believe it. It's strange you know your mind doesn't allow you to comprehend new things when in psychosis and the diagnosis just seemed like they doctors had no clue. Well that's what I believed at the time. Now that I've been on medication for a few years I can safely say I agree with the doctors.. I do have schizophrenia. From time to time I experience hallucinations but I know they're not real after it happens. It's usually quite scary and not of the norm. Like for instance when I drive to the servo I'll see a dead body on the side of the road or a dead dog in the middle of the road just as I drive over it. I don't see it in the distance just last minute. It scares me for a minute then i know it wasn't real. Fortunately I don't have these issues often so I'm relieved thanks to medication.,schizophrenia
504,"This is a very good question…
In mental health there are concepts called “insight” and “judgment,” and the two go hand in hand.
There are different domains to insight including;
1. Insight into a person’s own mental illness - Recognizing that they have a certain condition
2. Insight into the need for treatment and/or medication - Recognizing that they need help with their illness and whether or not they need to take medication
3. Insight into their actions in social situations and daily life - Recognizing the effects their illness has on their day-to-day life and how they interact with others and function in society
An individual’s insight will impact their judgment and the decisions they make in their daily life; whether they choose to seek help when needed, whether they choose to participate in therapy and/or take their medication regularly if needed, and whether they make choices that allow them to adapt and function well in society.
The level of insight a person with schizophrenia has is arguably one of the most important prognostic indicators of how severely their illness will limit their ability to lead a normal life. There are people with schizophrenia who have excellent insight, recognize that sometimes their thought process is disorganized, that the hallucinations they experience and their tendency to sometimes be withdrawn are part of their illness, and that they have a need to take medication.
In those individuals we sometimes say that “reality testing is intact.” In other words, at that moment in time they recognize what is real and what is part of their illness. This can fluctuate over the course of their lifetime, and during periods of stress or acute exacerbations, they may temporarily fail reality testing, but ultimately their illness will have a much better course and they will often lead happy, fulfilling, and productive lives. I have known physicians with schizophrenia, for example.

505,"For me i didnt know until i had a psychosis break. I didnt know what happened. I woke up and i started acting weird hearing voices and thinking there was people outside… i packed clothes and left my home walking around aimlessly. The voices told me what to do. It got dark and i started looking around peoples yards. I kicked off my boots and ran til i couldnt anymore than i blacked out (i wasnt drinking ) next thing i know i was soaking wet with tee shirt n shorts on. A boy walked by and brought me to his place because i was disoriented. In the morning he asked his sister to give me shoes and enough bus fare to go home… i blacked out again and came too sleeping on the beach. Some man was watching over me gave me some water n a orange and flip flops. I was on my way home and blacked out again. When i came to i was in the worst part of the city which is where all the homeless people hang around. There were elderly woman sitting around me to protect me. Again i tried going home. Was on the skytrain and it happened again i blacked out. This last time i came to i was walking around the mall with no shoes. By then i lost my phone and bag i packed. My feet were black i havent showered in days looking rough. I dont even know if i ate or had liquid all those days i was wandering. After i left the mall i seen a fire truck going down the road with blaring lights n all. It stopped for me and i told them my stoRy. They called for an ambulance and the police came too. The parametics wanted to take me to the hoapital because i told all of them i was on hard drugs and taking pills..i didnt want to go with them so i started running away and they followed me i jumped into the back of the police car… they brought me into emergency and i talked to the dr. Repeated my stories so they had me change into a hospital robe. They took blood samples and urine samples.. I fell asleep for 12hrs they said after giving me some kind of pills.. The Dr put me in the Emergency phsycriatic unit where i stayed for three days… when i was feeling normal i talked to the nurses about a shower n more food… the psyciatrist told me im Skitzopherenic Bipolar PTSD Anxiety and Depression. I was put on medication. This happened 5 years ago.. I still have audio hallucinations daily. Its manageable i listen to loud tv shows or music.. Only time i have no noise is when i goto bed…

506,"I can tell you what is said about schizophrenics is that they believe they are not crazy, everyone else is crazy.
Maybe that is for the most part true with majority of them.
I can tell you from my own personal experiance with my ex husband who was diagnosed schizophrenic this isnt always true. He was a classic case. He heard voices, accuse me or others of talking through our nose. Ect… My ex husband knew he was sick. He didnt say it very often but he knew. There were times when we would be visiting his mom and he would start arguing with her, he would become angry and start yelling at her for having kids. (She had a histort of mental illness herself, along with other family members). My ex husband would start crying as he would yell at her for making him the way he was. He blamed her for “populating” and passing the mental illness on to him. He would tell her she was wrong and should never of had kids. That he hated his life, he didnt want to live this way.
He knew he was ill. Most days he didnt act like he knew, most days he believed everyone was out to get him. Most days he would say wasnt the one crazy. But there were those times I heard him acknowledge his mental illness. There were times when we were alone he cried to me and asked why he had to live like this. He tried to commit suicide many times, taking all his meds at once. I had him rushed to hospital to be pumped. I dont know how many others are like him, But he knew he was sick, and would rather die than to continue living. He is now homeless and off all his meds. He has completely lost it and I feel bad I cant help him. I know he deteriorated after I had to leave.",schizophrenia
507,"Well for a start, stop calling people with schizophrenia ‘schizophrenics', they're people just like everyone else. Actually some of the most kind, intelligent and thoughtful folk I know are diagnosed with schizophrenia, so no, they are not crazy, whatever that means. If you could define what you mean by crazy that would help. Some people with schizophrenia are unconventional, or don't conform to conventional beliefs or belief systems, that doesn't make them crazy though, it just makes those who think that of them very narrow minded and judgemental. And as someone else said this world is pretty insane in itself — we are killing the planet and each other and we know it and think it's perfectly ok, or certainly seem to (lack of action against it says as much).
People with schizophrenia are often much deeper thinkers and they question what we consider reality a lot more, so to call them crazy is insulting.
So stop dehumanizing and disrespecting them, because they deserve so much better, as human beings with so much insight on this mad world (even though having ‘lack of insight’ is one of the insults thrown at them by psychiatrists, ironically).",schizophrenia
508,"I would like to answer your question in two parts:
It is now understood to be humane to refer to patient’s with psychiatric illness as- either “person with schizophrenia” or “person with bipolar disorder” instead of “ a schizophrenic”. It also helps us to be able to differentiate the person from his/her illness. The individual is not the illness, however, he/ she suffers from a particular illness/ disorder/ condition.
Schizophrenia, as classified under the broader spectrum of psychotic disorders in psychiatry, encompass multiple symptoms, fundamental and characteristic of distortions of thinking and perception. The term psychosis basically means loss of contact with reality. Thinking as we all understand includes the manner in which our cognition functions. Distorted perception is rudimentary to psychosis. In this, a patient may have hallucinations (perception in the absence of a stimulus, eg: hearing voices in the absence of an actual person talking- auditory hallucination), delusions (idiosyncratic belief’s held with conviction, despite evidence to the contrary, and not culturally accepted). So, we can kind of think of psychosis-like a dream state. When we are dreaming, we do not know that we are dreaming, but when we wake up, we realize that what we saw, was a dream and not reality. Most often, with treatment, the patient’s suffering from schizophrenia, start realizing, that the voices they hear, or the delusional belief’s they hold are part of the illness (this often also requires psychoeducation along with medication, in order for the patient to build insight about their illness).
With treatment, yes, the patient can develop insight (understanding that one has a psychiatric disorder, that requires treatment) into their illness, however at the onset, most often, patient’s do not realize that the asperity of the disorder.",schizophrenia
509,"“Can""? Yes people with schizophrenia can be aware of their mental illness. Though it is also common for those with schizophrenia not to believe they have it even if they have been diagnosed. I'd argue that sometimes that's a normal response to an unfavorable situation. I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (which has symtoms of schizophrenia and a mood disorder as well), but when I first started hearing the voices I believed they were spirits. It was how I explained my unusual experiences. It's much easier to believe that than it is to believe that it could be a mental illness, especially a chronic one like schizoaffective disorder. My parents, who are not mentally ill themselves, are still in this denial phase. They believe it could still be spiritual because they want to believe that it is curable and that there is something that WE can do to cure it. But nonetheless, where I am right now, I understand that the evidence for my symtoms being mental is much greater than the evidence for it being spiritual. And now that I've come to accept that (at least for the most part though at times I still find myself wondering if it could be spiritual) I can move forward in working to minimize and treat my symtoms.",schizophrenia
510,"We are aware that you think we are, however that calls into question your own sanity when you start labeling people and judging them as well as stereotyping them. I recently was at a beach with my dog and went to go leave and ran across one of my old friends who I used to snowboard with way back in the day. He didn’t even say hello, but whispered to his friend that I was crazy right as I was passing him by- so I could hear it when he was whispering. That was crazy. Why would you do that to someone? And you are just going to talk about them behind their back and not say hello?
Treat others as you would like to be treated and I don’t see why we can’t all get along. But if you do stuff like that, it kinda brings out the worst in people- doesn’t it?
I also had another old friend I used to ski with- these two guys were ski patrollers at a ski area I worked at for 5 years- whom I tried to say hello to in the supermarket and since I hadn’t seen him for a while, maybe even ask how he was doing. He just gave me a short “Hi” and turned his cart around and ran basically. It was pretty sad. I guess they loved to be the heroes when it comes to broken bones and throwing bombs for avalanche control, but when it came down to actually having compassion for people who were hurt, they failed miserably. Much like most of modern medicine who is much better at putting you together after a car accident than giving a suicidal person a reason to live.
Then you wonder why schizophrenics think the world is against them? Really? You just talked behind my back and ran away… and after I started saying how I really feel on Facebook- after these girls had gaslit me in front of others and started calling me names and saying stuff like, “She’s just crazy” after I had broken my collarbone which they blamed me for but was in fact a skateboard manufacturer’s fault- I actually confessed to them I was a diagnosed schizophrenic who was living at my parents house on Social Security Disability- everyone stopped liking my posts or even responding to them. At the time of these girls (actually 22–24 year old professional longboarders) arguing with me on facebook and gaslighting me, along with a nasty email saying I “blamed others” right around Christmas and that I was going to get a present for Christmas- which turned out to be my identity being stolen.
So on top of my collarbone being broken because the board manufacturer couldn’t make a downhill longboard that didn’t flex and also drilled it out wrong, and my dog dying at the time, and my town almost burning down because of a wildfire, I’ve got this snot nosed kids on facebook telling me I’m crazy and calling me names, who are also probably the same exact people who stole my identity- who might have also has access to the credit card I used to pay for longboarding equipment from a shop they were sponsored by- and I’m not supposed to think everyone is against me? Also on top of that when I went into the ER after breaking my collarbone they just thought I wanted drugs, kept me there for 6 hours- took x-rays of the wrong area, and were just going to release me saying everything was fine when my collarbone was in fact in 3 pieces.
When I broke it, in the parking lot of the longboard course there was an ambulance driver on call for the event. Even I know from my limited first aid training that when someone is really hurt, you shouldn’t try to just pull their clothes off them, but cut them off if need be- but he helped me out of my leather jacket by pulling on it, and the last thing that everyone heard from me was the scream as he pulled my broken bones apart in the parking lot. I refused an expensive ambulance ride and had a friend drive me to the ER, which was where they didn’t even believe I was hurt. The ambulance driver who pulled apart my shoulder and made me scream so loudly was even from that very same hospital I went to, but I guess they never talked to each other obviously.
And finally, after hours and hours of waiting in the ER- it had gotten dark, they released me with a bit of Tylenol and a figure 8 brace to drive home alone 4 hours. I could have driven home much sooner, in the daylight and gotten a prescription filled for pain pills, but they didn’t even believe I was injured. Couldn’t actually listen to what I said was hurt. When I got the bill I had to pay for the extra x-rays they took of other parts of my arm that weren’t even hurt- and I never said were, and there was also an order for a drug test that was canceled at the last moment that I almost also had to pay for. ARE YOU SERIOUS? You can’t even give aid to an injured person in physical reality is what I learned there, but I guess this type of stuff doesn’t happen to everyone. Just me right?
Then it took a full year to heal. The doctor was so weird, he wouldn’t even touch my skin or clothes with an ungloved hand and just kept taking x-rays of my unhealed collarbone for almost a year. At the first sign of healing he said I was done and looked so relieved not to have to see me again or have to do surgery on me. But it hurt and hurt and hurt and hurt and I finally complained enough they did a follow up x-ray, and apparently the break has healed, but it shortened my collarbone on that side by about an inch and my shoulder is separated. That is what hurts me every single day now. It feels like its being ripped out of socket sometimes if I’ve been sitting at a desk for too long, and always hurts all the time. I knew when I broke it- it was a bad break. But no one wanted to do anything, and said it would heal. But it never has. It never has.
My dog also died at that time. He was having problems walking at first and we just thought he had sprained a back leg. He was a 5 year old Border Collie so full of life, it seemed impossible that anything more might be wrong. But this tumor in his abdomen got bigger, and finally he just couldn’t walk at all. I paid the vet $900 for his surgery, to hopefully remove the tumor. Just a couple weeks before we had been skateboarding. I thought he would be alright. But then they forgot about his appointment. After I had paid them money. It was so weird.
Its a bad thing when you think people are all after you and against you, but almost worse is to be forgotten about- completely written off the face of the planet entirely.
But we rescheduled, and my dog’s tumor was apparently too much, the vet called mid-surgery and I had to let him go then. He didn’t wake up. I didn’t want him to suffer, and at that point he really couldn’t even walk. It broke my heart because he had been rescued from a farm who had starved and beat him. I could just imagine that he drank out of oil filled puddles or those filled with farm chemicals if he got the chance- since they probably didn’t give him much water either- and that maybe why he had that tumor and died at such an early age. I always thought love could conquer all, and though I wouldn’t take back the years I had with that dog, like I said, it just broke my heart.
And all this happened at the same time. Coincidence? God once told me that everyone was against me and they were going to torture and kill me. It hasn’t been wrong about that, it just wasn’t in the way I anticipated when it first informed me of this fact. Its just never what you expect, that is what I learned from God. Never is.
But you think I am crazy for thinking the whole world is out to get me and that I am cursed? I am though. Lets look at the evidence…",schizophrenia
511,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time. It started to take a toll on my health. I lost a lot of weight. I was contently dying. I got thrown out of most of the motels in town, and was running out of places to go.
As the disorder progressed so did my perception of reality. I realized the problem was much much worse. However, once I discovered a paradigm that made sense I ma...

512,"I did. Everything felt unreal and I had a hunch it was schizophrenia. I went to the library and got books out about it. I tried talking to doctors but they said I was well. I should have shown them the crazy emails I was writing. I really think it would have helped.
My mental health got worse and after being sectioned twice I finally got my diagnosis of psychosis updated to schizophrenia. It wasn’t much of a surprise and I was glad to have it officially recognised. I first learnt of it at my first work capacity meeting.",schizophrenia
513,"I had my Psychotic break, my descent into Schizophrenia come to fruition on Sunday 5th May 2002, when a bunch of people turned up in my head, in a moment. They were not “disembodied voices”, as often described in the literature, they were fully-realised people I could see, inn a virtual space that went online in my head. For the next 3 years, I travelled the country, struggling to deal with the abuse and my experience, and never once did it occur to me it might not be real. In the first year, I was voluntarily admitted to a mental health wing of St Guys Hospital, London SE1, for about 10 days, before I discharged myself. They medicated me during my stay (with Olanzapine, an anti-psychotic), but as I remember it, they never once told me I was psychotic. If they did, I never considered it for a moment. 2.5 years later, living in an English town, I found myself unable to leave my room in a house provided by a charitable organisation, because of the immersive “reality” that I was physically unsafe. I got a knock on the door, and I nervously answered it, to find a middle-aged woman who identified herself as a nurse. I do not know how she came to hear of me. We spoke for a while, then she said she was going to find a safe environment for me, and get me help. It didn’t involve hospitalisation, it involved a care home-type environment, where, at 25 yrs old, I would be the youngest resident by about 3 decades. I moved into the home, and began interacting with a Psychiatrist. After 6 months, he diagnosed me with Schizophrenia. Until that moment, it had never occurred to me for even a moment.",schizophrenia
514,"Some do some don’t. Some for example lack insight into their condition. For example they are deeply paranoid and nothing you can say will convince them that they’ve lost contact with reality. These are hard cases and often these schizophrenics end up spending a lot of time in mental institutions because their paranoias take over their lives and they can’t function properly or at all, and might end up getting into legal trouble, etc. They often also don’t take their medications because they don’t believe they are ill.
I would however say that most have insight into their conditions and what’s happening (their symptoms) are not normal. It can be a very terrible existence. I think severe mental illness is the worst thing that can happen to someone.",schizophrenia
515,With my Schizophrenia I was almost choked to death by an ex boyfriend and about 2 weeks later started hearing voices. My surroundings seem so bright like the world is fixing to blow up. I have uncontrollable laughing where I cannot stop laughing. I thought it was my brains way of trying to get better but I googled and it's from a traumatic brain injury. I cant sleep. So ashamed of the things I do. I remember doing them but dont know why I do them. Schizophrenia is sooo lonely. People either think you are faking it or treat you horribly. Not realizing your in your own living hell on earth.,schizophrenia
516,"Yes. Quite possible. And this happens many times. But as Dr. Joshi said above, they have partial insight mostly. This realization or as called in mental health field as INSIGHT, generally consists of many components. The current model of insight in psychiatry suggests that patients - be it depressed or schizophrenic, or having a PD, or any other out of many 100s - can get insight partially and may not generally understand what is truly wrong with them. Such an insight may happen in any of the four domains - having an illness, need for treatment, recognizing symptoms that cause distress and are unusual, social consequences of current mental state. In any of the four mentioned domains can a person develop insight. So, for example, a person with psychosis may know that social responsibilities are difficult to perform so better to take treatment. Another one can be more aware of impending distress caused by hallucinating voices.
In general, individuals with psychotic disorders do not accept having a mental illness, so it remains more a medical diagnostic cum labeling issue. Rest other domains can be acceptable to them, depending on stage of psychosis and other factors. In fact, labeling does not help much in treatment many times. Anyone without having schizophrenia or with any other disorder may resist acquiring a label too. So it is quite natural and obvious for humans to resist having a label of a psychiatric disorder. Labels of mental illness should not be forced on them to be something necessary for developing insight. A good and mature clinician these days would never use coercion towards a mentally ill patient. Insight is something that develops gradually during the course of treatment, and not the only parameter of recovery.",schizophrenia
517,"Yes, though it took a while.
I started to realize that something was wrong when I started to hallucinate. Before that I had a bunch of religious delusions that I thought was just self-improvement. But as I started to get catatonic, my family also realized something was wrong.
We eventually got help, and it was there that I started to realize I was in the midst of a psychotic episode. But because I didn't know much at the time, my doctors and therapist taught me about it.
So yes, it is possible to have insight into your illness with schizophrenia. I have it and many others do to.",schizophrenia
518,"No. That was the last thing on my mind. And no, my symptoms weren't dramatic but they did develop rather gradually. The first symptom I could remember was when I was about 17 and I was feeling awfully sad. I was taking an advanced Calculus course and it had been causing me aniexty. Immediately, I assumed I was only stressed and did a lot of meditations and I started attending church like a madman! I was desperate for relief and frankly, I just wanted the semester over with. This helped a bit but it was more of a “Today, I feel okay but tomorrow, I feel terrible!”
I self diagnosed myself with depression. I battled this for about two years before I began hearing the voices. When it first happened, I assumed it was my subconscious but it was bothersome. It felt as if someone was talking in my ears and there was no way I could stop them.
I had many attacks and I would go into brain fogs. The brain fogs were the worse. I would sit in a place for hours, not moving and tried to think because I would forget so much.
Thankfully, with the help of a friend, I was able to get tested and treated. Some days are good, others aren't, but I like to keep myself motivated.",schizophrenia
519,"For me personally, I drank my way into psychosis. I had also stopped exercising and ate unhealthy food for some time.
I started going on long drives to clear my head and found myself reading truck labels as they passed by thinking they were trying to communicate with me.
I also thought that license plates on cars were meant to convey messages to me.
My long drives turned into a country wide road trip, that while really fun, was in retrospect very risky considering how often I drank and drove.
As I drank and traveled I thought that aliens and/or the government were trying to talk with me.
By the end of my trip, I stayed at a hotel in Long Island City for a few weeks. I would look out the window and watch trucks and cars drive by thinking that people were stalking me. I thought the TV was talking to and about me too.
Eventually I had enough and decided to call the police to report being stalked. They must've thought I was crazy because they called an ambulance to take me to a psych hospital. Then began my journey in and out of psych wards and homeless shelters.
So, to summarize, I didn't take care of my body for a long time and drank heavily, which I believe brought on several psychotic breaks.
I still get freaked out by cars and the TV but am now on meds that help with the psychosis I was experiencing. I also don't drink anymore and joined AA which has been psychologically helpful.
For all I know it's possible aliens and the government were trying to communicate with me and the only way I could prove it is to look for the patterns on TV, truck labels and license plates. I believe sometimes there are messages there, but then again I'm schizophrenic and the whole seeing messages thing could just be a self fulfilling prophecy.",schizophrenia
520,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

521,"Because schizophrenia is not a physical illness. It's a mental illness..
The main cause of schizophrenia is chemical imbalance in brain, which can balance due to medication, when person stop medication , symptoms again starts.
Chemical balance is depending on medicines. With the help of medication, person can live normal life.
Schizophrenia is controllable illness/ disorder, not curable .
Thanks…",schizophrenia
522,"Schizophrenia is described to be the prototypical psychiatric disorder and involves a schism in cognition, emotion and behavior. It is a major psychiatric condition. Like other such conditions, it can be effectively treated. However, we use the word cure cautiously because it appears to represent a notion that one will never be bothered by this condition again. Truly in that sense there is no cure for fever or headache either, because there is always going to be a possibility of getting fever or a headache again in life.
It is nonetheless possible to have good recovery and see the troubling symptoms of schizophrenia disappear. With the right support, a person with schizophrenia can be treated in a home or community setting and even if medical intervention and hospitalization is needed, it can be managed with a brief period and then the person can be back home and at work too. There however are sure and definitive requisites that need to be met to get a positive outcome. Here are some factors that can enhance the chances of a normalcy in life in spite of schizophrenia.
* Appropriate psycho-education about the condition
* A supportive, reassuring and encouraging approach
* Being able to talk to people, and feeling connected
* Working towards independence and self reliance
* Maintaining good work and personal relationships
* Having a supportive family who is involved in care
* A good treatment plan and compliance to medication
* Cognitive therapy plan to work on negative thinking
* Lifestyle changes to avoid/ cope better with stress
Recovery is an ongoing process in any psychiatric or psychological conditi...

523,"No, Unfortunately, scientists have not found a cure as of yet. The research and treatment that has been done in the areas of early intervention ( interventions stop the illness from being triggered) have been highly regarded. And along with that is all the work that has been done in the area of genetics. This is priceless information. Schizophrenia, a life long disorder can be managed to a great degree similar to diabetes. As long as the person takes medication as prescribed, has a good relationship with their doctor which promotes honest answers, lives a healthy lifestyle that focus’s on nutrition, good sleep and at least 3 or 4 times outside as exercise, keeps their reactions to stress at a very low level and has a good support team, people can live very satisfying lives.",schizophrenia
524,"It is a popular misconception about cure for schizophrenia . Which is not true . We have successfully treated 10,000 cases in last 30 years - contact any psychiatrist - will tell you various 10 options for complete recovery.
Yes some times it is true that 40 % are like diabetes - may require long term medication but can maintain normal life with medicine - you can call it cured with maintainence therapy - and rest 60 % does not require. Medicine depending upon the cause - available treatment - patient education understanding - family support - new therapy n new idea n update in research in psychiatry - stigma - follow up- compliance - etc . So do not get disheartened.
In some cases who take medicine regularly - once they are stabilised with regular medicine dose - that dose can be reduced to half - then again after 2. Month to half - then once a day - then once in 2 days - then once in 3 days - then once in a month. And gradually stopped with normal life.
In some cases this who are unable to take it regularly - they can be give - injection of the same medicine - now available - not daily - but once in 15 days - another available is once in 1 month - another available now a days in once in 3 month …and follow the same procedure as above - keep on increasing the duration and gradually stop.
In some cases - oral drops or liquid - to be given after mixing up in the any liquid who does not have any taste so person will not come to know about medicine - so by staying at home - with care taker - this can be the best option without knowing .
In some cases anonymous group - joining and listening how various patients improved - so i can also - like alcohol anonymous - group can help a lot .
Those who are tech Sauvy - schizophrenia group - on internet - can yield lot of information - about latest treatment which gives you a felling also - that i am not alone which helps in recovery .
In some cases addition of ECT to improve fast in all areas in. Just 15 days - can be a boon for such patient n relatives.
In addition to that - if you and the. Family and the society removes stigma of psychiatry and person removes the stigma of being schizophrenic - can help the world to remain free from schizophrenia .
So a request - consider schizophrenia as a disorder like malaria and spread - remove stigma n help the patient to live in society with proud.",schizophrenia
525,"No. there is no “cure” but some people are lucky enough to find that medication helps them function better. For some people, it can be one of the most mentally disabling conditions of mental illnesses. There are also people that recover.
Web M.D. writes:
Schizophrenia Recovery
“Some people do recover “fully” from schizophrenia. Ten years after diagnosis:
50% of people with schizophrenia recover or improve to the point they can work and live on their own.
25% are better but need help from a strong support network to get by.
15% are not better. Most of these are in the hospital.
Antipsychotic medications work well. One study found that symptoms go away in about 70% of the people who get treatment. Their social occupational functions often improve within 6 months, although that score may not rise much after that. Your quality of life can get better most of the time.”",schizophrenia
526,"It's entirely possible that it can be cured, we just haven't figured out how to do it yet; mainly because it's a complex and varied illness, and the mechanisms that cause and constitute it seem to originate in the one part of the human body we know the least about - the brain.
I think there's every reason to be hopeful of a cure in the future. The way that mental illness and the mentally ill are viewed and treated by the medical establishment has improved enormously over the last 50ish years, and both neurological and neuropsychiatric research is accelerating. The more we know, the closer we get.",schizophrenia
527,"I have a schizoaffective diagnosis because I experimented with sleep deprivation so I was said to have insomnia and a mood disorder but really just staying awake for the first time for as long as I did and in the circumstance I did had me not control my aggression well.
I say that because I don't know what your circumstance is.
I suppose a diagnosis means you either displayed symptoms or a physician decided you had symptoms.
What would be a cure for your thinking? I suppose cognitive behavioral therapy or adjusting your way of thinking could be considered a cure. If you feel that sharing your experience means you continue to think the same way; consider long term changes and seek growth. It's hard to leave or forget meaningful experiences. It's harder to be told what you've done or tried to do is symptomatic.
Maybe you have an imagination. Psychiatry basically considers imagination the prerequisite for delusionary thinking and hallucinations. Maybe practice expressing your imagination in different ways that are more commonly socially acceptable. Personally; I talk to myself for company and motivation. I say things like; “You've got to..”, “Are you going to..”, and in the next sentence, “Let's see..”. I imagine people don't understand the context but I train myself. I am my motivator. Perhaps you do something similar. I might be considered to have multiple personalities, as I compartmentalize different thoughts so as to not “cross threads"".
Maybe you see a different entity or basically something outside of yourself. Maybe you'd say, “Should I do this entity?”, of course, that's a very general expression so it has to be understood in your own context. Maybe you “see"" or “imprint” a separate idea onto something that what everyone else does; sort of like imagining a painted wall has a different colour paint. You are seeing something that's not there? That's a hallucination? Perhaps; it's imagination and your way of expressing doesn't maintain socially acceptable norms.
I am not sure what you experience so I can only attempt a general offer to change your mind. If you change how you think; perhaps you would be cured. If you change how you express; perhaps people would not detect anything. Don't hide your thoughts is my suggestion but if you want to be cured; begin changing your habits.",schizophrenia
528,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?

529,"Schizophrenia can’t be cured by psychiatrists who don’t care. They write prescriptions for psychotic patients but they don’t listen to what they have to say because the physician would need to be interested in this patient instead they want them out of their office ASAP.
Schizophrenia can be cured, embraced, and a person can learn coping skills to get some control over their feelings. It is easier to do this when your brain is working at full capacity however some people find that getting a major tranquilizer chemical dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, and histamine lobotomy can give them a sense of relief causing them to experience feeling a calm mood. If the way the chemical lobotomy makes your body work causes you any distress you must tell the physician immediately so that any additional doses of medication will be stopped. If you keep taking a major tranquilizer drug you can deteriorate physically and mentally over the period of your continued drug use. You may become so psychotic that you can commit suicide after you couldn’t find a competent psychiatrist or doctor because none had the professionalism necessary to consent to supervise your major tranquilizer drug withdrawals so that you end up no longer using major tranquilizer mood drugs.
Many people have to live with their schizophrenia symptoms. It would be nice if we were respected as members of the community who face challenges instead of everyone turning their backs on us and leaving us to be eaten alive by negligent psychiatrists.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) did a study in which they compared the health outcomes for people in countries where all patients identified by a psychiatrist as psychotic are prescribed major tranquilizer drugs versus people living in countries where people could not be supplied with major tranquilizer drugs (branded as antipsychotic drugs). The result was that the people who were major tranquilizer drug users would become more chronically ill physically and mentally over time due to side effects of the medication. People in countries where they weren’t major tranquilizer users have a high rate of complete recovery from schizophrenia which permitted most citizens to live as active participating members of their communities.
The pharmaceutical industry has invested in lobbying that people who live with schizophrenia are all psychotic and need antipsychotics to manage their psychosis symptoms because antipsychotics make psychotic patients so manageable they will no longer be a danger to themselves or others. My experience is if someone is having a bad antipsychotics mood drug trip and doesn’t kill someone in desperation or anger then they never would have harmed themselves or someone else prior to medication in the first place.",schizophrenia
530,"Schizophrenia is not a disease or diagnosis per se. It means “We have decided we don't like the perceptions you communicate and we don't really know what the f- to do with you.” It is a “diagnosis of exclusion” and with the exception of mauve factor as a blood marker, it only means WTF. So, since “they” don't know WTF, you or your family and friends more or less have to figure out what went wrong, when if possible, what went right, and how to restore your health. Since it's a WTF response, it follows that there isn't a coherent response re “cure” no matter who claims to be a degreed know-it-all. There are books on the topic, and resources here and on Twitter.

532,"Johnathan,
Schizophrenia is a medical disorder within the brain. The brain is one of those parts of your body that can be changed very little. It is your body’s computer system.
When there is a virus downloaded, it is not always fixable. I have medical things I cannot change about myself. My height, my eye color, my inability to do math or learn new languages.
I’m sorry but there are things that medicine has yet to be able to medically fix. Hopefully in the future, schizophrenia will be one of them that is.

533,"These are two questions that often come up when discussing mental health. And while there is no single answer that is right for everyone, there is some important information to consider when thinking about these disorders.
First, it’s important to understand that schizophrenia and psychosis are not the same thing. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder that can cause delusions, hallucinations, and abnormal thinking and behavior. Psychosis, on the other hand, is a symptom of mental illness that can include hallucinations and delusions. So, while someone with schizophrenia may experience psychosis, not all people with psychosis have schizophrenia.
With that said, there is no “cure” for either schizophrenia or psychosis. However, there are treatments that can help people manage their symptoms and live productive, fulfilling lives.
For people with schizophrenia, antipsychotic medication is often the first line of treatment. These medications can help reduce hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms of the disorder. In addition, psychotherapy and other support services can be incredibly helpful for people with schizophrenia.
As for people with psychosis, the treatment will ...

534,"Schizophrenia is a brain disorder. There are physical differences in brains of people who have schizophrenia that are absent from brains of others. People who have schizophrenia also have unusual brain chemistry metabolism of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. Finally, there appears to be a genetic factor.

536,"Because treatment for any mental illness is not perfect. You will take medications that won't work for years until you find one that does. You will spend the rest of your life taking those medications, and talking to a therapist all while just trying to be “normal”. You will want to be able to work, date, and have a family. But for too many with mental health issues that's not how it goes. Let alone someone with schizophrenia who is convinced medication is not a solution and won't do anything to do better to get to “normal”.
There also is no “cure” for schizophrenia. I will always struggle with it. Some days are eorse than others, but it's how I know the medication is working. I get “new days”. Not one bleeding into months of the same bs symptoms everyday. I will struggle with this everyday, for everyday of my life. You don't “shut it off” or “stop it”. That's not what mental health issues are. It means in the best times of your life, you only feel suffering. And the worst of times? Someone without, can only judge you. They will judge you for not showering, cleaning your house, or even eating. Getting out of bed to do ONE of those things, requires celebration.

538,"I can answer this based on experience. First, how old is your brother, I'm guessing in late teens to older twenties. Usually it gets diagnosed around 16 to 18. My brother was 17 when he had a breakdown at work. He had signs from a young age at mental illness, very moody, anxiety, extreme outbursts.. but my parents wouldn't believe it, they saw mental illnesses as some failing on their part, would never take him to psychiatrist. Fast forward, my dad is gone, my mom dies, only me and my sister are left to care for my brother, I'm 22 at the time she is 20, he is 19. We both work full time, he gets social security after a 2 year battle. The next 10 years, this is my example, I can't say if it will be the same for you, were a complete nightmare. The doctors, nothing against them they do their best many are very caring and this is hard, kept diagnosing him with various mental illness. New medication, New treatment, random break downs, hospital stays, institutions, back home, repeat. FOR TEN YEARS. At my expense and his welfare. My sister helped as she could but eventually had her own family. So, after all this I am 33, My brother is 30, he is on medication, in a mental health facility similar to a nursing home, going to college, on social security, eventually will move to an assisted living apartment, I still help support him. This is as good as it can be for him and I. He has trouble everyday with things that I can't even really understand. At the same time, while I want to help all I can, there are limitations. He does much better in a supervised, regimented, organized, social, environment. In all the years living at home with me, regular life was too much, he couldn't keep track of medication, doctor visits, personal hygiene, cleaning up after himself, trying to go to school. It wore us both out. Finally, in the setting he is now we are both much happier, and he is more like himself. So, you can have a life, a real life,but it may come with some limitations, I hope this helps.",schizophrenia
539,"Psychiatric medicine never cures schizophrenia. Psychiatrists think it is a permanent condition and do their best to make it so. In the 1950s, before psych drugs existed, two Canadian psychiatrists named Dr Hoffer and Osmond, discovered how to actually cure schizophrenia, with large doses of Niacin (vitamin B3) and vitamin C. Even without any treatment at all, 1/3 recovered spontaneously and never had another episode. Another third recovered but had occasional recurrences. Another third did not recover on their own but could be controlled with Niacin and vitamin C. This was the beginning of orthomolecular psychiatry. I practiced orthomolecular psychiatry for 30 years - treating mental illness with nutrition, after testing for nutritional deficiencies and toxicities. At the Princeton Bio center, we got thousands of people off of psych drugs, or prevented them from starting in the first place. That institution no longer exists, but doctors like Kelly Brogan are continuing this work. For more information, see her books, or Natural Medicine, by Bonnie Camo MD.",schizophrenia

It can be the talk or action. Going out without control, when realized mind gets troubled and is called Schizophrenia. Conscious mind thinks that something is wrong that I am not able to control.

Schizophrenia can be the outcome of constantly dipping back into psychosis to many times leaving you trapped between the two,,,!!!",schizophrenia
542,"My psychiatrist told me that finding the right combination of medication is like being a chemist…everyone is different, reacts differently.
They now have DNA tests you take that illustrate which medications are compatible with your genome.
So, after finding the right combination of medications, you might have psychotherapy. I was discharged from psychotherapy because, after a year, I didn't need it any longer. My problems were your problems. Mental illness wasn't navigating my life. My pain was your pain. I fight hard through schizophrenia. I try so hard.
So, now it's just medication monitoring with the psychiatrist every 4 months for 15 minutes.
Now. Is treatment working? I still have hallucinations, multiple times everyday or none at all for 5 months. And everything in between. The Negitive symptoms persist and I feel I am deteriorating. The major depression symptoms come and go. Sometimes symptoms from both completely level me, or I may just have symptoms from one and very few times, I have symptoms of neither. Those days are rare, but fantastic.
Windows and waves. If I dip in the world of psychosis or fall deep into the marianna trench of depression, the medication pulls me out. They become shorter episodes and not as intense.
Otherwise, I set goals for myself everyday. I need a sense of accomplishment in my life, since I was very high functioning before the illness. Sometimes I fail my goals, but its okay... I try again when I feel better.
I dont leave the house much, and have been training myself how to be a mechanic. I am still learning, but I can do quite abit…I just put new timing cover gasket, water pump and gasket and oil pan gasket on my daughters car before she left for college. The car is working great for her.
I am capable of intelligent work, I just have some bad side effects that prohibit me from any full time employment…I am trying to work part time, but I have no idea which symptoms I will have tomorrow, so I am afraid. Not lazy, afraid of getting fired. I have a nice pension i receive, so I am grateful for that.

543,"I have schizophrenia. Here are ways to help myself deal with the illness.
Avoid loud, crowded venues. Lots of people, noises and bright lights leads to heightened emotion and alertness. No concerts for me.
Don't watch News (or any gut-wrenching drama or violence) on TV. News creates suspense, heightens emotion, increases alertness. All three things, in my case, lead to psychosis.
Take meds religiously. And don't miss doses.
Try not to eat processed foods (commercial bread, packaged foods, candy, etc). Hard, because I'm a junk food addict. Heavy ultra processed food intake can start my psychotic symptoms flaring within 24 hours.
Avoid all conflict, especially family conflict. If I can't avoid it, I leave. Mid sentence, mid gathering, doesn't matter. Just leave. Not having a psychotic episode is more important than worrying about the appearance of rudeness.
Go to therapy. Even when I think I'm doing fantastically well, my therapist points out areas where my thinking is still delusional. Therapy was necessary to recognize the extent of my delusions (I thought I was a small rodent and my family was hunting me….) Yeah.

545,"Thanks for the A2A.
“Normal” is a relative term and schizophrenia is a diverse disorder. These two points make it difficult to give a fail-safe answer. The answer can be ‘yes’ or ‘no’ depending on the case (person with schizophrenia) in point and what exactly is one referring to when using the word ‘normal’.
Schizophrenia is a disorder where the very experience of reality is distorted. Who the person used to be before the onset of this disorder may not exist anymore. Thus the word normal takes on a new meaning even if the person with schizophrenia is capable of holding a job and living independently with adequate medical and therapeutic intervention. Some examples could be: they have to fight paranoid thoughts/ doubts everyday, they have to ignore the voices in their head, they struggle with making simple decisions, they cannot and do not enjoy socializing, focused thinking like problem solving feels effortful, etcetera. Having to deal with such problems everyday is not ‘normal’ even if people with schizophrenia have learned to cope up with these issues. These schizophrenia induced altered experience and behavior become a part of their everyday living and a new baseline or ‘normalcy’ is established eventually over time. This level of functioning is mostly below the level of functioning people with schizophrenia were capable of before the onset of the disorder itself.
Please remember once a person has suffered a severe mental disorder like schizophrenia, the very nature of their everyday struggles becomes qualitatively much different from those without such disorders, the mentally healthy people. I personally feel the tag ‘normal’ is misleading. However, it is very much possible to live a meaningful, productive, engaging and even happy life even when one has schizophrenia. The quality of the life for such people will be invariably determined by their lifestyle choices (diet, exercise, medication, therapy, socialization), social support (presence and involvement of friends, family, spouse, children), personal factors (motivation, intelligence - both emotional and intellectual, level of productivity), and life circumstances (presence or absence of stressors like other health problems, financial problems, real or imagined threat, etc).
Living with schizophrenia is difficult. However living well despite schizophrenia is very much possible. Turning away from herd mentality of what is ‘normal’ and ‘not normal’ can take off the pressure to blend in. If you have schizophrenia (or someone you know has schizophrenia) just know that - it’s okay if your (or your relative’s) reality and struggle doesn’t match with that of others; accept yourself the way you are (or your relative the way he/she is). If you are having problem with such acceptance seek counseling or therapy. You (or your relative) should take periodic medical consultation keep from becoming a threat to self or others. The rest should be fine. People eventually learn to live with themselves when they want to live well.
Hope this helps!",schizophrenia
546,"Hi yes they absolutely can! I had my first psychotic break at 20 yet wasn't diagnosed as schizophrenic til I was 40. I managed to know when I was close to the onset of full blown psychosis and would take 2 to 3 days off work and just stay in bed and take Thioradazine tablets that would knock me out with awful side effects. This happened about every 4 years.
Then when I was diagnosed I was working a very high pressure job and couldn't take time off work so went to the doctor and asked for some medicine that I could take all the time. Round about then, Thioradazine use was discontinued by the Medical Fraternity anyway due to it's high risk of causing heart problems.
That was 15 years ago and I have changed meds several times under a psychiatrist's supervision until we have found the one that works best.
In that time I have had children and raised a family (I am female). Stayed happily married and had a career in banking (white collar, non executive) and studied part and full time and developed a hobby into a second career.
I still become psychotic about every five years which now means I am admitted to a psychiatric hospital for two weeks each time. I am quite ok with that.
My family and extended family have been very supportive. My employers never knew as I feigned a kidney condition instead. Medical certificates for work just state ""A Medical Condition"" not particulars - so that too is covered.
I have some problems with goal setting and motivation but have accepted all the help I can and done research into developing strategies to offset this.
If the symptoms reappear strongly then I go see my Psychiatrist to decide if I need to temporarily increase my dosage. My General Practitioner also works closely with my Psychiatrist so that in an emergency I can see her and she can communicate with my Psychiatrist if I can't get an appointment with the latter on short notice.
I live in Australia and when I was bringing up my children the Mental Health Service gave me a trained Case Manager who would visit once a month to make sure I was coping at home. This was not a Social Worker it was someone from the Mental Health Team. I really appreciated them.

548,"I would say that “normal” doesn’t really exist, but I guess I know what you mean.
A person with schizophrenia can lead a life that is fulfilling. They might also live a life that is “normal” I suppose. It depends on the person really. If by “normal” you mean working 40+ hours a week at a job, having a spouse and children, and participating in life in a sort of “normal” way…yes I guess it is possible, but I would say that for most people who have schizophrenia there would be some kind of alternative formation of what is “normal.”
You have to remember that having schizophrenia still means that you are living with a disability, so the disability has to be managed in some way. Most people who have schizophrenia will need to be stabilized on medications in order to lead a “normal”-ish life, so that in itself is a bit not “normal.” In the US that means that someone with schizophrenia will have to have access to medical care usually through some kind of health insurance. In the US that means you need to either have a job with medical coverage, you need to be wealthy, or you need to be on something like disability and receiving government health coverage in some way. So, let’s say someone is more “normal” and they have a regular job that provides health insurance. Not only will the job be stressful, but there will be stress from having to worry about if they lose the job that they will lose insurance and lose medical coverage which provides medications that keep them sane. In essence, there’s kind of a lot riding on the job with medical insurance, and it adds a lot of stress. But what is bad for schizophrenia symptoms? Stress.
Then I guess you want to add on the stress of having a nuclear family if we are aiming for “normal.” A woman who has schizophrenia can have children, but there will definitely be added dimensions to any pregnancy, because she’d need to either go off all medications or still be on meds which can be a risk too. But let’s just say the kids have already been born. As any parent can tell you, raising children is still stressful and expensive. People with schizophrenia are often not employed or are marginally employed. I would say that they often are discriminated against in employment although I don’t have numbers to back this up. So, they will likely have less money than “normal” peers unless they are wealthy through inheritance. But we were going with the regular job and regular kids and regular spouse and everything.
I guess the odds of a person with schizophrenia having a completely “normal”, average, uneventful life are slim. Most people without schizophrenia don’t have “normal” jobs and “normal” kids and “normal” marriages and “normal” everything, although there are some people who do. Having schizophrenia means you will likely have more stress and less money. At the same time, stress can trigger symptoms. “Normal” people have trouble finding compatible spouses, so you add the dimension of having a really stigmatized illness to that, and you’ll find that the dating pool drops significantly. “Normal” people sometimes have kids with special needs, so that could happen to a person with schizophrenia too.
So, I would say that the statistical odds of anyone having a “normal” life are low. The odds of someone with schizophrenia having a completely “normal” life are much lower. But there is a HUGE difference between “normal” and having a good and fulfilling life.
In society we tend to judge people as having achieved a good life if they have a good job, if they have a successful, “normal” family life. But there are many many other ways to have a good life. I would say that “normal” shouldn’t even be the goalpost. “Normal” is like the mean number when you are measuring something. Sometimes even if you measure something and there is a mean number there might actually be no data that hits exactly on the mean number. Normal is like this. Sometimes people hit the mean, but a lot of times they don’t, so “normal” is just this idea we have out there about what is “normal” meanwhile no one is living a “normal” life.
So, TLDR (too long don’t read): Is it possible? Yes. Is it probable? Not really. Is it necessary? No.",schizophrenia
549,"I can sympathize because I was likely born with schizophrenia. I consider it a gift now because it has made me more compassionate in a world that needs more loving people. I try to listen and offer encouragement but it can take a toll. That’s when I have to rely on my support network to keep me from going downhill. It’s about finding the right balance.
Until I had a breakdown, I wasn’t told that a chemical imbalance of the brain runs in my family. You weren’t supposed to talk about mental wellness, which I still don’t understand. I think attitudes are changing, though, to more compassion thanks to groups like the Invictus Games. I’ve found it helpful to build a support network that includes these wounded warriors.",schizophrenia
550,"Yeah most of us do. The only ones who probably wouldn't are very low functioning schizoids but they are extremely rare. Thing is, on the outside is where it seems completely normal. I have a girlfriend, I have friends, I spend time with family, I have a job and I go to uni. Seems pretty normal right? I couldn't really care much less about any of it besides my girlfriend and my education. Friends are nothing to me, these are fake relationships and so are my relationships with my family for the most part. Uni is important because music is my life's passion and I love my girlfriend. My mask gives me a normal life or the appearance of one. Normal for me would be my life right now without friends, family or a job I hate. I will ask though, what is normal? I assume you mean compared to neurotypical lives but even they are very different from each other. We just happen to be missing out on a lot of the emotional side of it. I have ambitions, desires and hopes just like anyone else. My life is normal for me and that's what matters.",schizophrenia
551,Yeah but its extremely difficult and takes alot of patience and endurance. You got to realize whats in front of you that exists. The rest of it is just in your mind. Knowing the difference between reality and fantasy is probably one of the main things to work on if you know somebody that is schizophrenic. You got to tell yourself this is real this isnt this is real and this isnt.. If you hear voices that can be very difficult because you'll spend time worrying about the voices instead of everyday life. The Key to living a normal life is learning how to focus. I noticed with schizophrenia theres a thousand things trying to get you unfocused and get your attention. Focus on what you need to do and get that done. Remind yourself whats in front of you and around you because its very easy to lift off in some dreamland and waste years in some fantasy.,schizophrenia
552,"The answer to that questions depends upon their reaction to therapy. 1/3rd will become ill, be treated aggressively, and get well to not be bothered again by the disorder. 1/3 will become ill, be treated aggressively, get better or improve, stay better for sometime, then have another episode. Their lives are usually marked by some sort of decline in intellect, motivation, social skills or other “residual” symptoms. 1/3rd will become ill, and despite aggressive illness not improve significantly, and be ill the rest of their lives.
For all patients, aggressive treatment, compliance with treatment, family support, lifestyle changes to lower sources of stress, and good follow-up by your therapy team are critical. For those in the last two groups, the medications for this disorder are not gentle and have many side effects. Over time, they can take a toll—diabetes, movement disorders,etc. They can lead to a shorter lifespan. In poorly controlled patients, brushes with the law are not uncommon, which unfortunately in our punitive society can lead to prison. There is frequently a loss of career, friends, intimates, and family with this disorder due to the unpredictability and bizarreness of the patient’s behavior. Many will become dependent upon social support of various means or live in group homes.
This is one of, if not the most difficult psychiatric disorders. There is hope—-but there is a need for more understanding of the causes of the disorder. There is a great need for more effective treatment—-and treatment without side effects.",schizophrenia
553,"For years I carried a man’s obituary in my wallet. He apparently was from my small town though I didn’t know him, he was a teacher, but was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He died alone in an apartment in the city in his 60’s. Never did hear one peep out of the man until the moment he died, though he lived as a “crazy person” all his life, and when he did finally die it took five months to publish his picture and story in the local paper. It was in a corner, very small, next to so many others who had done things with their lives and had families. That is normal though for a schizophrenic. That is very typical. We die alone. You told us to shut up- especially about God- and many do just that. They don’t want to be a bother. They don’t want to stand out. They die alone and the only way you ever find out that they even existed is if you read the corners of the obituary page.
I think its a really sad thing to live your entire life basically with no one to talk to besides the voices in your head. That is why I carried around his obituary for so long. Like someone cared. Like someone noticed. Like we know each other. In the movie A Beautiful Mind Nash and his wife are depicted in a loving relationship during his entire illness, but I believe if you look into the reality- that was not the case. She only went out with him again after he had earned some acclaim and fame, not prior. Anyway, don’t be a stranger folks! Nor treat others like numbers. Its hard to lead a normal life when you are branded and loaded onto cattle cars by Nazis.",schizophrenia
554,"If YOU asked, as a person with schizophrenia, you can live a life with schizophrenia as good as normal as you can and want. Especially, if you are high - functioning.

556,"CAN SOMEONE WITH PSYCHOSIS LIVE A NORMAL LIFE?
I have bipolar 1 disorder and have had many psychotic episodes in my life time (none for the past few years, thank goodness) however, when I was in one of these psychotic episodes it was only temporary.
Was it possible for me to lead a normal life when psychotic?
I seem to remember doing normal things, like getting up, brushing my teeth, eating my breakfast etc. but these were just rote activities that take little thought. If I were to try to read a book, for example, it think would have been impossible for me to concentrate because my brain was filled with extraordinary thoughts and hallucinations.
Let me see if I can remember one or two things that happened:
Yes, I was watching TV one night, just a casual night, when I saw an advertisement for Theraflu come on. I have seen that ad. many times, as have you, but this time the guy who came into the room had horns. Yes, horns coming out of his head. I remember studying him and his horns, and thinking that it was strange, but it didn’t worry me much.
A similar thing happened when I went to see a new psychiatrist. I walked into his office, sat down and there he was on the other side of the desk with horns coming out of his head. Now this affected me more than the guy on TV. Why? Don’t know. Maybe, it was because he was a real person, or maybe I recognized that he was somebody who was trying to help me, and I didn’t think he would be able to do much if he was the Devil. I was a bit wary.
However, the fact that I was able to go to his office at all showed that I was functioning normally, but you couldn’t say that I was leading a normal life.
Once I went out for dinner with a friend. We were eating our meal, I looked down, and there were hundreds of cockroaches walking around on the floor. I found this quite interesting, and studied them closely. I mentioned it to my friend, but she just laughed. Now was I leading a normal life? It depends on how you look at it. I was out with a friend having dinner- so that was normal - but if I was seeing these cockroaches then I was obviously ill.
Another time I saw bugs - let’s keep the observations similar - was when I was in a half-way house, having come out of the hospital the day before. I shouldn’t have been in the half-way house at all, beause I was more ill there than when I went into the hospital a month before. When I went to bed there was no problem at all, but in the middle of the night I woke up and saw that the floor was covered in little black beetles - thousands of them all milling about. I shot out of bed, petrified, and went to see the warden (who was fast asleep). She came hurrying down to my room, and got really mad with me for waking her up because she couldn’t see any beetles anywhere.
Now, I was able to walk about, eat my food, have a conversation (albeit rather a bizarre one) with this woman, but I was obviously not leading a normal life.
I don’t think I have a definitive answer to this question except to say that psychosis varies from time to time, and people (at least me) are able to carry on in a normal way, but my head is full of chaos that is not apparent to other people.

557,"What’s normal? Who’s living a normal life? That is the question.
If you mean having a job, being independent and dealing with the world for most of your needs and activities (buying, bussiness, going to the doctor, clothing…), the answer is absolutely yes. Some schizoids are more high functioning than others, it may (and it does) need effort, but I guess most of us do (yes, I know there are some schizoids who live locked up in a room with no job, no activity, and no hope, but I bet they are a minority). You can trick most of the people and they would never imagine you are a schizoid.
If you mean having a normal social life, with friends, a wife, children… that’s more difficult. I know some schizoids do (always keep in mind that SPD happens along a continuous spectrum), while other (like me) don’t. Could I try and do it? I guess so. But it would mean such a big effort, it would be so fake, and so hard (not so say impossible) to keep it working with time, that I don’t think it is worth. And so unfair for that woman. I don’t think I can fake love, and, anyway, if you have you to fake it, it wouldn’t be love.
P.S.; my answer would apply for low and medium degree schizoids. The word “disorder” is usually saved for the most severe cases, high degree schizoids, who very rarely exist and would virtually be like robots. So, for them, having a “normal” life would obviously be much more difficult.",schizophrenia
558,"I currently live what I would consider to be a very normal life.
Currently I am in college studying in hopes of getting accepted into medical school. I have a rented home slightly outside of campus which I share with three other roommates. I enjoy gaming, reading, walks through the park, and other quite ""normal"" hobbies and interests. What is considered my normal, however, may be strange to some. I do not have friends in college and only have three back in my home town whom I text once every couple weeks/months. I do not have family outside of mother. My father left when I was 16 and my brother died last year, but apart from those things which I have no power of changing, the rest of my family (i.e. uncles, grandparents, cousins) are practically non-existent in my life. As others may find it quite ""abnormal"" having no communication with another person for months at a time,apart from ordering my morning coffee, I find it relaxing and am quite indifferent to having contact with others. Say what you may about what ""normal"" is, but I think it's quite vast and defined on an individuals' idea of what ""normal"" or ""average"" actually is.
Granted, I see the way I live my life to be different from the majority, but I am perfectly content with my existence and the way I go about it.
Best to you.",schizophrenia
559,"Thanks for the A2A.
The answer is ""maybe"".
The truth is, ""schizophrenia"" is not a single condition. In the same way a fever can tell you that something is wrong, the symptoms that define what we call schizophrenia can tell us that something is wrong/off/unusual/atypical with a person's brain functioning.
Back when I was practicing, I treated people with the most severe forms of mental illness, so my viewpoint is probably slanted.
Folklore in the field was that patients with schizophrenia followed the ""1/3, 1/3, 1/3 rule"": a third got better, a third stayed the same, and a third got worse. I don't know if research backs up these numbers, but I always had a number of people who went into spontaneous remissions.
My strong advice is to find a psychiatrist who knows what he is doing, and university affiliated. The medications ...

560,"One thing may assist you to lead a ‘normal” life, i.e. a life where you do not experience unwanted auditory hallucinations that frighten and upset you, or experience delusions (false unshakeable beliefs), whether these are grandiose, relgiose, or paranoid.
The thing that may assist is to avoid cannabis, methamphetamine, cocaine, synthetics and mushrooms as these drugs may have an adverse effect on you and trigger psychotic episodes About 40% of regular meth uses experience psychotic breaks.
The people I know who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and persist with using these illicit substances tend to have recurrent psychotic episodes or develop a chronic psychosis where they are never free of symptoms. They tend not to have partners or children, or hold down jobs.
All the best if you do have this diagnosis as psychosis is difficult for you to experience, but also difficult for those. around you as you are no longer the person you used to be before psychosis set in",schizophrenia
561,"I think that if a person stays on their meds, works with their doctors , stays in therapy, its possible they can lead a normal life.

I was married to a very nice, caring man for 15 years. After 10 years, he developed schizoaffective symptoms.

562,"I have Bipolar I with psychotic features. Thanks to proper medications, I become stable. From my early teenage years, I already experienced hearing voices. I wasn't aware for the first times. I thought they were real voices. Things got strange when I began to hear them more frequently and more vividly. E.g. when I was home alone, the voice called out my name loudly. I wasn't scared though. More like confused. And few times more with random words spoken by this mysterious male voice that I don't recognize. I tried to ignore it as I think “it's just probably my brain playing games with me.” And I truthfully thought it was a common thing that happens to people.
Delusions though, are a bit harder to handle. They always get me anxious and agitated. But since I'm pretty good at covering it up, it would be hard for people to see if something's wrong with me.
I've never told this to anyone including my husband. Until I met my psychiatrist last year. And telling this to her actually gets me the right diagnoses hence, the right medications. So far there's no reoccurring hearing voices and delusional thoughts bottled up.

563,"Schizophrenia is a mental illness that can make it hard to think clearly and interact with other people. But even though people with schizophrenia have this illness, they can still live normal lives. They can go to school, get a job, and have relationships…
Here’s my explanation with an example 👇
Imagine you have a friend named Sam who has schizophrenia. Sam is a great person, but sometimes he has weird thoughts and experiences that make it hard for him to live a normal life. For example, Sam might hear voices that aren't there, or he might see things that other people don't. These things can be scary and confusing, and they can make it hard for Sam to do things like go to school or work.
But even though Sam has schizophrenia, he can still live a norma l life. There are things that Sam can do to help manage his symptoms and live a happy and fulfilling life…
One of the most important things that Sam can do is to take his medication. Medication can help to reduce the severity of Sam's symptoms, and it can make it easier for him to think clearly and make decisions.
Another important thing that Sam can do is to get therapy. Therapy can help Sam to understand his illness and to develop coping skills for dealing with his symptoms. Therapy can also help Sam to build a strong support network of friends and family who can help him when he's feeling down.
In addition to medication and therapy, Sam can also do things to take care of himself physically and mentally. This includes eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly. Taking care of himself physically and mentally can help Sam to feel better overall and to manage his symptoms more effectively.
Finally, Sam needs to be patient and persistent. Living with schizophrenia is not easy, but it is possible to live a normal and fulfilling life. With the right treatment and support, Sam can achieve his goals and live the life he wants…

Schizophrenia - for me - is worse. I often hear voices in my head arguing, taking bets with each other about how long this version of Jarett will live on this randomly drawn occurrence of today, and whether or not he's going to figure out the 'secret' about how insignificant / significant / whatever his life is, or how to go to bed tonight and wake up as some other person or alien or...

566,"I have a numbers background, so I compared population, ages, and suicide rates for both diseases.
Schizophreniacs: 20–40% attempt suicide and 13% complete the act.
Disease onset generally between 15 and 25 years old.
Affects 3.5 million Americans.
Bipolars: 25–50% attempt and 20% complete the act.
Disease onset generally at 25 years old.
Affects 5.7 million Americans.
**Life expectantcy is reduced by 9/10 years for both disorders.
I would have thought Schizophrenia is much more difficult to live with for the patient. But the increase of 5–10% in suicide rates and the seriousness in which these acts are approached leading to a 7% increase in completion does lead me to think Bipolar is a more devastating disorder to live with.
Looking at the numbers in this way only points me to questions that I cannot easily find answers for. How much does the government spend on each? Who is getting treated? Male vs female factors, Inpatient vs outpatient, new drug therapies for each, etc. However I do believe the numbers speak to the original question as well.",schizophrenia
567,"I feel this question was made for me specifically, because I've dealt with both at varying levels of severity practically all my life!
I can give you an answer from my personal experience, but understand this is not everyone's experience and it varies from person to person based on illness severity, longevity, and personal perception.
Both of these illnesses have similarities but far more differences, so it makes them hard to compare to one another. There are high functioning people with schizophrenia that you wouldn't even suspect with the disorder, and there are very low functioning people with bipolar disorder. Statistically, schizophrenia is the more commonly disabling condition due to the fact the nature of the illness is chronic and affects your cognition, so not much time for recovery between episodes, and a lot more lasting residual effects when episodes subsides and. Bipolar is episodic, and many individuals experience a /mostly/ “normal"" or euthymic mood state between episodes where they are not affected by mania or depression, and thus, (for some) psychosis.
I will discuss how I experience the main symptoms of both of these disorders, or rather, two disorders wrapped up in a box and labeled: Schizoaffective Bipolar Type™.
I was diagnosed with bipolar first at 19yrs old, but I've had symptoms and it was suspected since I was about 15. I've experienced manic episodes, hypomanic episodes, depression, psychotic depression, psychotic mania, and mixed states.
My manic episodes typically start as hypomanic ones where I feel really good for awhile, I get bored of sleeping, I feel the need to talk more and crack more jokes, I get even more hypersexual and flirty than I typically amazing, I get really creative with makeup, music, and art projects, spend a couple hundred dollars without missing it, and overall just more functional and I can get a lot of things done. Kind of like I popped a molly or two. It's a great time!
When things progress into mania however, I'm no longer functional. I feel so damn good I genuinely CAN'T believe it or stand it. The energy is so chaotic. I often laugh so much I cry…. because I wish I could stop laughing. I'm constantly pacing and everywhere I go I feel like I'm literally flying. I get….very strong. I'm small, I'm only 5′1, but get me angry enough and I'll move 300lbs+ like it's nothing. I just become invincible seemingly, and I don't feel it when I'm hurt or sick at all. I talk so loud I'm literally yelling everywhere I go. Extremely fast too. When I cross over from hypomania to mania it's like my thoughts and speech go from being super fast to broken entirely. I go from having really fast thoughts, to thoughts so fast I can't contain them, to a billion thoughts at once splitting down different tracks, to being incapable of thinking at all and operating soley on impulse. I entirely stop sleeping, one time I didn't sleep for a whole 7 days. I become incapable of resisting my impulses. I don't eat because I can't sit still long enough to and I find it severely boring and unimportant. I spend thousands of dollars thinking it's not going anywhere. My hypersexuality gets so bad sometimes I can't even leave my room alone in the dark curled up on my bed rocking back and forth because I feel like I need to jump out the window and throw my naked body at anyone I see, including family members. I just feel so feral literally gnawing at my skin and scratching things and pulling my hair out because I have more energy inside me than I can contain. I tend to rush everything including hygiene and getting dressed. Overall, not a good time, but I'm often convinced that it is anyway and get so deluded I can't see anything wrong with my behavior until I'm stabilized through meds, or I crash typically after I've hurt myself or someone I care about. These episodes for me last anywhere between 1 week to about 6 months.
Depression has never been a stranger, but I see a lot less of it since I started experiencing mania more frequently. Nonetheless, it's severe when it's here. Just an overwhelming sense of worthlessness and uselessness. I don't really get guilt, I don't believe it's a useful emotion at all, so I don't experience that aspect of depression much. I typically have insomnia, but usually the depression after a manic episode will lay me out for 14–22hrs. I definitely get suicidal and every waking moment I'm in genuine deep pain and agony and every breath I take feels like it's burning me alive slowly. I won't shower, or eat, or say anything more than one word slightly above a whisper if at all. Sometimes the despair hits me so suddenly and heavily I just collapse. Sometimes I'm so numb and just can't feel anything at all, including physical pain. I have a long history with self harm, and that's always been a go-to coping mechanism for me. These episodes for me typically last a couple days to maybe a week at most these past couple years but I've had depressive episodes that lasted months to even over a year with my first major one.
Now I'm going to talk about the psychosis I experienced when in a manic or depressive state compared to my psychotic episodes apart of the schizophrenia side of my illness.
When experiencing psychosis in a manic or depressive episode, the mood episode ALWAYS starts before the psychotic symptoms do, and the psychotic symptoms don't show up unless the mood episode is SEVERE. I tend to have more delusions than hallucinations in these episodes, but when I do have hallucinations they're very whimsical (manic) or haunting/terrifying (depression). I either feel really grandiose or persecuted and have delusions of grandeur (thinking I'm a god or a prophet or some all-powerful entity here to save my loved ones and the world) or delusions of persecution (the FBI is watching me from outside my window and I'm going to be taken into custody).
What separates the psychosis I experience in manic/depressive episodes from the psychosis I experience on a nearly daily basis from the schizophrenia side of the illness I experience I'd say is the longevity, severity, and quantity of symptoms.
I experience both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 22yrs old (I'm 23 now) after what I presume to be my first major psychotic episode where I was convinced that I needed to kill god because I was abducted by aliens and they showed me how needlessly full of fear the human experience is and that death isn't real, which I started to test it out but my best friend was there and he pulled me out of the way of the truck I had started to boldly walk out in front of. On his birthday, might I add. I just genuinely didn't believe I could die at that time. Aside from that episode, symptoms of psychosis I experience on a regular basis are visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations (though I've experienced hallucinations that incorporated all my senses to the point they were interactive). I usually hallucinate people/humanoid creatures and animals! My favorites being these guardian yetis from my college days that escorted me home and stood watch outside the house keeping me safe, and a homeless man that does parkour but never comes inside anywhere. I often see shadowy figures and they're typically a neutral presence just slipping around corners and watching me from a distance and leaning up against things, but when I'm stressed they group in numbers and move around frantically like they're looking for something creating extremely loud static that hurts my ears. Also when I'm stressed, I get nonstop auditory command hallucinations usually to hurt myself and/or someone else and hear very loud shrieking.
My delusions are stronger in a psychotic episode than a psychotic manic or depressive episode as well. I think because they have more time to develop so they make more “sense"" in my mind and even with awareness I can't shake them. My last hospitalization was after I hurt myself because I kept being told by voices to go out and get pregnant so I can offer the baby as a sacrifice and I'd started looking for suitors even at the hospital. I ended up with a lovely girl there though instead. We got scolded, but honestly worth it.
I also experience disorganized thinking and speech patterns. I make up words often, and if I'm to literally say what's on my mind at any given moment it won't make sense (for instance, right now when I let my brain speak naturally it says: “yes, we ought to buy the water bottles, but with what dirt do we wash ourselves clean and dusty? Fingerprints hold clues to ether” our water has been off so perhaps that's why??). I think this is one of the symptoms that affects me most day to day, because it's still there even with medication. It makes it incredibly hard to do any writing or speaking because it takes up so much of my time just trying to filter my thoughts and make them make sense. I also have limited verbal expression and can't think of words when I'm speaking 95% of the time, can't get my thoughts together on the spot so freestyling is entirely out of the question for me, and stop and start sentences sporadically and jump into other topics very loosely related or completely unrelated altogether. I tend to come off as very “ditzy"" and I hate it because I've always been so smart and people knew that until I got really sick.
I experience catatonia when I am severely stressed sometimes. I go completely rigid and you could move a part of my body and it will stay there.
I still don't quite know what flat affect looks like exactly or if i experience it but I know I find it often hard to emote. I feel in my case it stems from a childhood of masking my emotions for survival, but I have a lot of symptom overlap with other disorders as well, so I'm just not sure.
These are a brief rundown of my experiences, so let's get back to your question: Which is more difficult to deal with?
Bipolar disorder is a hard, exhausting, life ruining, absolute travesty to experience, and so is schizophrenia. I got used to being bipolar though. Came to accept and expect its ways. It took years to stabilize on proper medications, but overall it feels familiar and I know when it's here 9/10.
I can't quite say that for my schizophrenia. Maybe since I didn't expect myself to have it and the very nature of the illness is to deny the existence of itself, so it's harder for me to recognize it within myself….but it almost killed me in a way that I feel is more sinister than the way bipolar almost killed me. Bipolar gave me a warning notice. It stuck a note to my door saying I'd be evicted from my mortal shell if I continued partying, not sleeping, picking fights, etc. Schizophrenia didn't give me a note. Schizophrenia said “you will die"" but it never said when or where or how. It took my thoughts so they were no longer my own and I knew nothing of what to expect.
Both conditions have their own versions of hell, and having both absolutely sucks to sum it up sweetly. Both are worsened by time, the earlier the age of onset, drugs, and of course stress. Both have caused irreparable damage in many areas of my life. Both affect me every single day.
However, looking at my experiences from an outside perspective, I think schizophrenia has been pretty dominant and clear in its efforts to destroy me, never failing to remind me that it could do so at any moment. I think it's harder to deal with for me because the amount of negative symptoms that meds can't get rid of, and how it alienates me from my loved ones so severely. They all say it's like I'm a completely different person and I don't listen to logic or reason at all when I'm in a psychotic episode. I'm often unpredictable and even sometimes embarrassing to be around. And it scares me. Bipolar mania often makes me fearless, but psychosis is terrifying, and I don't scare easily. The day can start off normal and by 4pm I've locked myself in the bathroom because I'm convinced I'll be kidnapped if I come out because I'm seeing shadows under the door walking past and low voices that sound like they're plotting to take me away. I can't watch horror movies alone or be alone after watching them because my mind likes to recreate them in its own interpretation in real life. I have a reduced threshold for stress so any little thing can send me into an episode of some sort if I'm not careful, or if I'm just unlucky I suppose.
I truly do stand by the fact what's more/less manageable varies from person to person, but for me and my experiences, schizophrenia seems to have had the bigger impact on my quality of life than bipolar has.",schizophrenia
568,"I have schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type. In very, very general terms, it means I have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
To have schizoaffective disorder, rather than schizophrenia, you have to have a mood disorder as well and that mood disorder can be bipolar, so it is like having both.
You can make assumptions from this information about whether or not one is harder to live with, but I think that it can be just as hard to live with ‘only' bipolar disorder. The worst thing a person has been through still feels like the worst thing they have been through, even if someone else may appear to have it worse to an outsider. You cannot really quantify it in a meaningful way.
I have suffered in ways that are very uncommon and dangerous to a 'regular’ person, but people still suffer their own kinds of hell. My situation should not be used to dismiss another's pain.",schizophrenia
569,"From a personal relationship standpoint... Schizophrenia. They tend to orbit out of relationships and wind up alone. From a family/financial standpoint Bipolar... able to maintain relationships but Manic episodes cause havoc on finances (and at times relationships). As an individual, not sure which is better... being lost in your delusions or the guilt felt after a manic episode... either way both are very debilitating.",schizophrenia
570,"I have schizoaffective disorder, which means i have both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I’ve only experienced them together, but I can tell you that both (especially together) are very difficult to manage. I hear voices 24/7 that have called me names because of my intrusive thoughts (from OCD) so it’s very hard to manage your thoughts when you’re afraid of being admonished! It’s like a disorder sandwich. 😅 Feel free to ask me any questions or read my posts to find out how to manage these disorders. Peace! ☺️✌️",schizophrenia
571,"Although I find bipolar disorder excruciating to deal with, I'd wager that schizophrenia is typically worse. At least people can relate to bad moods (although it's quite more than simply a mood problem to have bipolar), whereas not too many people can relate to hallucinations that must be highly confusing and/or frightening :(. My schizophrenic friend used to think I & my friends said things that we didn't. Out of the clear blue sky. Which kind of made him isolated in his own head away from others' perception of reality. But it of course depends on the severity of each + it might be “comparing apples to oranges.”",schizophrenia
572,"Schizophrenia has both what are called positive and negative symptoms. Positive can be thought of as extra unwanted things that are there such as delusions and hallucinations;negative are things that are lacking or impaired aspects of ""normal"" qualities or behavior. Some negative qualities are -problems with motivation, social withdrawal, diminished affective (emotionally appropriate) responses, speech and movement difficulties. Most modern medication mostly treats the positive symptoms leaving the negative symptoms in place or even arguably worse. hence you have a double edged sword of not only not being able to participate in life normally but often not being motivated at all to do so as well.
I would also corellate psychotic episodes of schizophrenia to manic and depressed episodes of bipolar just for the sake of argument as both being similar downtimes in the life of the sufferer. Whereas in between times the bipolar sufferer can approximate periods of normal functioning the schizophrenic is still dogged by those negative symptoms which neither resolve themselves naturally nor are helped by medication. I would therefore say Schizophrenia would be the more debilitating illness.",schizophrenia
573,"Schizophrenia has notably more disability associated with it; and there are far more high achievers with bipolar than schizophrenia. I can think of heaps of high achievers with bipolar, but only one with schizophrenia. And I suspect the 20% suicide rate for bipolar (as another Qoran stated) is exaggerated - I suspect it's more like half that.",schizophrenia

Some branches never re grow, leaving a gnarled and ugly scar that can’t be disguised by the beautiful foliage that grows around it. There’s always that one stark, bare branch, shivering through the eternal winter of its creation.
It’s not up to us to decide who sufferers more.

575,"Schizophrenia, I think.
I suffer from symptoms of bipolar I disorder, although I've not been diagnosed yet. (I have not courage enough, but I'll have to get it soon.)
I have to tell you that with depression and hypomania one can feel really terrible, but still sane. I wouldn't want to be schizophrenic, mainly because I can't imagine how insane I would feel. Of course it is more difficult do deal with bipolar I disorder, but still, I'm glad that I do not suffer from schizophrenia and I rather wouldn't change it.
(It's only my personal opinion and I'm sorry for English.)",schizophrenia
576,"I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type which is the clinical term for winning the mental illness jackpot and having both symptoms of bipolar I and schizophrenia
they are both hellon earth. I just woke up from a multi year depression it was bad. I had little to no insight into how bad when I was knee deep in it. I simply could not function I just laid in bed every day and couldn’t communicate properly with people. I had to get ECT to treat myself. I say I woke up because I suddenly became aware of just how sick I am.
Mania is a lot like being drunk in the sense that you are high, buzzed, euphoric and invincible too. But suddenly just lik being drunk you don’t feel so good anymore y feel out of control and can’t slow down or stop. You feel compelled to do things and you’re not sure why
both diseases have components of psychosis which is a detachment from reality and is very confusing you feel ok but have hallucinations or delusions and often disorganized behavior which is a clinical way of saying you’re a hot mess but you keep pushing on until you’re completely disconnected
in short they both suck",schizophrenia
577,"It depends on the person suffering. A chronic illness hurts and limits us. Often we must see a physician at regular intervals for treatment of the illness and face the certainty that our chronic illness might worsen and we could become sicker. When we are considering the effects of a chronic mental illness, we must consider also, that our illness may worsen as well. Additionally, many times with a serious chronic mental illness the brain we use to think with, perform activities with and reason with in order to exist daily in our environment doesn’t always tell us truly what is around us, and can frequently deceive us with false thoughts and tainted information. With chronic serious mental illness, in our thinking, it’s often difficult to determine what is true and what is a figment of our mental illness. Chronic mental illness affects our body as well, just as chronic health problems affect the mind. To me, it’s no walk in the park to have either kind of illness and only the individual can determine which is worse.",schizophrenia
578,"That is like asking how many siblings is worse, or what sexual identity is worse, or what ethnic heritage is worse.
Which is to say, it is offensive and requires destructive generalizing to answer as phrased. The experiences housed under these industrial labels are heterogeneous and the preferences and values and beliefs of each person can differ from those of others. It is nonsensical to try and compare these concepts on a scale of ‘better’ and ‘worse’ — there is nothing to the ideas which allow for that kind of comparison.
Do some people have a harder time, in particular ways, than do others? That is reasonable to say. But, there is no uniformity across psychiatric labels. To the contrary, making this about labels rather than experiences misses the whole point: that individuals are not interchangeable and that these labels do not explain anything about a person or what their life is like.
Fuck the Misery Olympics, and fuck treating people as labels rather than human beings.",schizophrenia
579,"More difficult for the individual afflicted with the condition, for their family and friends, for those treating them, or for the general public? There likely isn't one answer, in any case, because both the disorders and humans having the disorders are quite complicated.

Accept that you will have bad days and be aware of it when it happens. This does not mean that if someone does you wrong that it's always your fault. Write nasty letters to people that piss you off, don't send them. Shampoo, rinse, and repeat...... Sounds boring and mundane but, it works.
Create your support team. Only let a few people into your group. These are the people that love you no matter what and will call you out on your shit because you have given them permission. Don't broadcast to everyone you know about your condition because you will get put into the ""crazy"" pile and it makes life a challenge. People that don't have the condition, have a difficult time seeing how challenging life can be for us and they will use it against you at another time. I hide my disorders very well. Nobody would ever know that I am certifiably cray cray.
Use the positive things about bipolar and do positive things. Use your creativity and create a masterpiece, only if it is only you that thinks it's fabulous. Write poetry. I do this a lot.

581,"Both of these conditions are considered severe mental illnesses.
It is difficult to treat either of them for different reasons. People with schizophrenia may well have delusions and hallucinations without the correct treatment, while people with bipolar will more than likely have mania and depression without treatment.
The treatment is different in some respects, but similar in others. Bipolar is a mood disorder so requires mood stabilizers, whereas people with schizophrenia will likely require anti-psychotics for their hallucinations and delusions.
The crossover is when people with bipolar 1 have either delusions, hallucinations or intractable depression. They may well need anti-psychotics as well.
But these two are very difficult diseases to treat. It is a fine art in the hands of a professional. They may need to try various medications until stability is maintained.",schizophrenia
582,"The schizophrenia spectrum disorders have the following labels:
Schizophrenia
Schizophreniform
Brief Psychotic Disorder
Delusional Disorder
Schizoaffective Disorder
They revolve around the same symptoms (see below) except schizoaffective is a tiny different:
Two of the bipolar and mood disorders include the below:
Bipolar Disorder
Major Depressive Disorder
Now look at some of their symptoms:
As you may have noticed, there seems to be some repetition and redundancy going on. To answer your question, I would first strip the labels and deal directly with the symptoms. Looking at symptoms clarifies what exactly a disorder is. So in the case you mentioned, how to differentiate between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in its early stages before it becomes full blown would be like asking how to differentiate between what you see in the above images. As you can see a lot of it is the same. So it’s difficult to answer you until you specify which symptoms you are concerned about.
The above symptoms in my opinion are actually a subject of their own. Let’s take Depression for example. Responding to it early is possible and thus dealing with it before it gets full blown. Differentiating it between the Depression of schizoaffective disorder although part of the schizophrenia spectrum would be contradictory as it’s the same symptom. In my opinion, as you can see there is a lot of hidden complexity when asking the question you asked until the label is removed from the symptoms.
When the extreme of Bipolar Disorder is at its height, it can induce hallucinations (a symptom of schizophrenia). These are the same hallucinations so catching them early and differentiating between them before getting full blown is a difficult question to answer because of their variability. Take for example how hallucinations can be intermittent and things can go into remission. Then you have patient case individuality. It would be better to generally deal with the symptoms as a subject of their own. Social isolation can cause some of the symptoms mentioned above so responding to it early may prevent them.
As a point of information in case you find it relevant, did you know Schizophreniform Disorder is Schizophrenia that doesn’t go beyond 6 months? It’s the same thing but the time aspect allows the use of different terminology.
Suffice to say that the symptoms vary from patient to patient in different ways including time and dealing with labels I feel will become obsolete in the future. Symptoms are the essence of what’s going on. This is why my answer went straight to the symptoms because in my observation, dealing with labels doesn’t make sense according to language rules. Labels to me are linguistic corruption if you analyze them closely.
To further your understanding, if you would like to see schizophrenia spectrum disorders/bipolar and mood disorders stripped of their labels and any duplicate symptoms you can use this web function:
https://abbasbooks.com.au/label-explorer-label-normalize/
This will help you see how much redundancy and similarity there is and why there is so much confusion. This is why I don’t deal with labels and how that has allowed me to understand them better. By the way, Bipolar Disorder until recently accommodated symptoms that didn’t seem like Bipolar Disorder. They eventually gave those symptoms a separate label and renamed it to Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or DMDD. That’s one example of how their classification system has design flaws.
The DSM in my opinion is somewhat unstable and doesn’t involve a natural classification system.
In my experiments, at the symptom layer many mood disorders and schizoaffective disorder are almost the same thing (see below):
Peace!.",schizophrenia
583,"No. A person has one or the other.
Now - can a diagnosis of bipolar disorder “turn into” a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder? Yes.
The differential is that in bipolar disorders, a person can have psychotic episodes, but only in the midst of a mood episode, while in schizoaffective disorder, the psychotic episodes can happen independent of mood episodes. This is a fine line, and not always obvious in the person's history (possibly not even to that person), so it's not uncommon to modify the diagnosis on that basis.",schizophrenia
584,"This confusion exists, in my view, because if you have either one of these very serious illnesses you will have a lack of control of the mind. You will not be in charge of your thoughts or your feelings.
I am sure there are many other biological reasons, but for me it is this loss of power.
When you study these two diseases (I have bipolar) you will see that they are not really alike in so much as Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder whereas bipolar is a mood disorder. That is not to say that each illness doesn’t have strands of both problems on occasion.
The real confusion comes about when you have bipolar 1, like me, because you are often subject to psychosis which closely resembles a schizophrenic psychosis. However, a bipolar psychosis, thankfully, does not last long as it is a temporary state. This means that the person returns to a non-psychotic state when the episode is over.
Unfortunately, people with schizophrenia have a hard time with psychosis and it often persists even when the person is medicated with anti-psychotic medications.
You can easily see how these disorders are both influenced by a loss of control, but if I were to hazard a guess, I would say that schizophrenia is a far more difficult illness to manage.",schizophrenia
585,"I live with schizoaffective disorder. This is essentially schizophrenia with bipolar mood disorder. I was never really manic though. I can tell you be majorly depressed was one of the pitfalls. If i could “look forward to” a “manic episode”, i might have been better off. I hear the fall is the worst part but at the sametime having mania isnt ideal but still wouldve been nice. The schizophrenia is and can be dealt with as it comes along. Being psychotic or having hallucinations is more tolerable with medications and is more manageable than guess work with anti-depressants that is longer taking them and deciding you need to up the dose or switch to find and try a different one. Thats my take on it at least.",schizophrenia
586,"I am personally inclined to say no on this one. I do not think someone with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should tell others about their condition. This is entirely up to each individual. However, be aware that there is much stigma revolving around mental illness as a whole. In addition, people in general are not necessarily very educated about such matters. People fear what they do not adequately understand. Divulging these illnesses can make people suddenly act weird and strange around a person with these illnesses, thinking that we are some sort of crazed lunatic.
Me personally, my illness is on a need to know basis. I do not randomly tell people cause it hurts my feelings when they immediately start acting strange around me and treating me in a different manor. Despite my illness, I am still a living human being just like anyone else.
Quora is different. On this forum I like to speak of my illnesses, and I like to relate with others of similar afflictions of the mind. I also like answering questions in order to possibly shed some light in forms of educating others that are interested in learning about these severe disorders.
My therapist, psychiatrist, relatives and a select few of others are the only ones that I tell of my mental plights. Random strangers I meet in person have no clue what is going on with me mentally. What is the purpose of telling a random person, “Oh, by the way, I am “crazy"" and have a severe mental disorder known as schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, and then create some awkward tension between us?

589,"One that works for one person may be effective for another person. It all depends on the metabolic system of the individual. Sometimes, antipsychotics immediately gives side effects such as shrilled voice or absolute discomforts in the throat and induces anxiety. This is based on my observation on others as I do deal with schizophrenic people. For instance, Resperidone is effective for some and ineffective for others. Similar is other antipsychotic medicines. Olanzapine is generally very good but increases weight substantially. It produces stooping back and sluggishness. Quetiapine should not be given for people with withdrawal from drugs as there is chances they go back to it. It is effective through. Aripiprazole is effective and does not increase weight.
It is very important to assess/observe the person taking medicines. I as a lay person observe from sleep habits, say how many hours in a day. Increase or decrease of medicines is based on such habits, which is indeed quite good. Walking, talking and general observation of the person be made as to improvements etc.",schizophrenia

My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
591,"Hi Mark. This is a mixed up answer. The truth, in my experience, is that it is different for each person. It is almost always mostly medication and what works for each person involves some trial and error to find. So the best one is the one that works for that persons life.
By example, I have seen people who were fully functional in the community with a single injection once every 3 months. I’ve seen fully functional in folks that only took oral meds and were reliable in doing so independently. And I’ve seen lots of interventions that fall between those. It comes down to what works with that challenge, and that particular brain and body.
I’ll also say that it involves family and friends who understand and can support and help watch for symptoms that the person won’t always see. It involves talk therapy with someone who can get out of their own way and learn to speak the language of that persons experience and symptoms. And it takes some buffering and patience and empathy if/when symptoms flare.
That is where I’ve seen the best outcomes. And if it’s really persistent then and ACT Team is the gold standard and should provide all of this and more. Good luck out there.",schizophrenia
592,"Question: What are the best antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia?
Answer: It totally depends on the person and how their brain interacts with medications.
Keeping that in mind, I really am a strong believer in the effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics, because I have been helped tremendously by them. Before I used the long-acting injectables I would always quit taking my meds, because, as many people who have to take antipsychotics know, taking meds sucks. When you take oral meds it is easy to skip doses and just discontinue them, because they make you feel really sleepy or whatever. With long-acting injectables the dose is auto-delivered during like a 3–4 week time period. Do you get sleepy? Yes. Can you get used to the medications? Also yes. For a person with schizophrenia, it can be difficult to see just how much medications help. For me, even when I was helped by meds, I hated taking them, so I would just stop or only take them when I wanted. This doesn’t work very well. With an injectable, you get a relatively steady dose and this can even out your symptoms quite well and create stability in your life. Also, with injectables you can often be on a smaller dose overall than the oral meds which is great! Do I still hate taking meds? Yes. Do I hate having an illness? Also yes. But, I’m very fortunate that my medication combo works well for me, so I will gladly take my meds rather than be psychotic. The long-acting injectable is just one of the meds I take, but without it I would be dead.",schizophrenia

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

595,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
596,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
597,"You can use CBD oil to cure Schizophrenia. It is derived from natural hemp extracts and contains no psychotic elements like THC. Hence, it is safe to use.
Schizophrenic patients usually show signs of mind distortion and change in personality. CBD is known to cure this disease by reducing artificially induced symptoms of psychosis when taken at a higher dose. CBD along with other medicines can cure Schizophrenia.
The cannabis possesses antipsychotic and antidepressant properties and therefore, it delivers excellent results while treating various mental conditions. It also has been used for combating stress, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.
CBD when used as an antipsychotic medication, it has the ability to develop a close link between the endocannabinoid system (ECS) of the body. This further offers the body with its own innate cannabis-like chemicals and mental wellbeing.
CBD is available in various forms like tinctures, edibles, lotions, balms, etc. to give you optimum health and help you remain free of any ailments.",schizophrenia
598,"What are the rehabilitation methods for schizophrenia patients ?
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder in which the affected person loses all his / her interest and hopes in general life and activities and lives a very abnormal and disorganized life.
Let’s have a look at the therapies available to rectify the Schizophrenia issues in a person and achieve the goal of making them live a normal life.
The main therapy is the Psychotherapy in which we do not require to give strong chemical medicines to the Schizophrenia patient but get indulged into an individual psychotherapy in which the psychiatrist or therapist can and will teach the friends or family members of the patient about how to handle and deal with the patient’s thoughts or behaviour.
There are a number of psychotherapies depending on the severity or majority or frequency of the Schizophrenic issues. These therapies are quite useful as there in no involvement of the strong medicines or chemicals which the doctors prescribe for the mentally sick patients. As these medicines have major side-effects also, so it’s better to go for some psychiatric therapies which has no side-effects at all and helps to recover in a better way.
Individual psychotherapy: In this therapy, the psychiatrist or the therapist teaches the friends and family of the patient about how to handle and deal with the patient’s thoughts and behaviour. For this therapy, there is safe, caring and confidential environment to explore their feelings, beliefs or behaviours in different-different aspects of life.
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): This therapy is helpful to Schizophrenics who have extreme negative thoughts and beliefs as the Psychotherapist helps and teaches a person to change potentially harmful or destructive beliefs and behaviours. This therapy can help people with Schizophrenia learn to live better, reduce certain Schizophrenic Symptoms and avoid relapse.
Cognitive enhancement therapy (CET): CET is a performance based, comprehensive, developmental approach to the rehabilitation of social cognitive and neurocognitive deficits. Participants work at recovery through structured group and computer exercises. CET is designed as a recovery phase intervention for symptomatically stable persons with severe mental illness, who nonetheless remain socially and vocationally disabled. CET is the result or conclusion of more than 30 years of clinical experience and research in schizophrenia treatment. Overall, CET attempts to increase mental stamina, active information processing, and the spontaneous negotiation of unrehearsed social challenges. It does so with a focus on enhancing perspective taking, social context appraisal, and other components of social cognition.
Social skills training (SST): Social skills training is a type of psychotherapy that works to help people improve their social skills so they can become socially competent. SST is predominantly a behavioural therapy but cognitive therapy can also be used in some situations to maximize the success of SST.

599,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
600,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
601,"There is no permanent, lasting cure for schizophrenia. There is only treatment for our symptoms. I wish I could give you good news, but schizophrenia is an organic brain disorder that can be confirmed via MRI. Other organic brain disorders are things like Parkinson's, Alzheimers, and Epilepsy, and those don’t have cures either.",schizophrenia
602,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

Some more APs developed in the last century are risperidone, olanzapine,quetiapine, aripiprazole. All are available as per orally applications ( pills), some of them also as long action application (LA). No one of this medications is perfect. But psychiatrist are trained to search with the patient the best alternative. If they collaborate there is a change to find the most effective medication for someone. Furthermore schizophrenia treatment is more complex as only finding the best medication for someone. Patients and their relatives need psycho education programs were they learn about what schizophrenia is and what skills they need to fight against this disease.",schizophrenia
608,"Since everyone who has schizophrenia is different, the “best” schizophrenia treatment is what works for that particular person.

If you knew how much we had to deal with over the years, with hospitals, committing him, watching him suffer, living with him, and knowing that a wonderful, brilliant man had to go through what he went through, you wouldn’t say it’s a gift.
Because if you knew that he never asked to be ill and that he wanted a wife and family and a normal life, you would never say it’s a gift.
Michael, in his more “normal” moments, was sweet, funny, and kind and never, EVER violent. He had an illness that, to this day, has no cure. It’s not a gift.
Update: we just acknowledged the 10 year anniversary of my brother’s passing. It’s still hard and since then both parents have died. Maybe they’re up there somewhere playing chess and talking about God.",schizophrenia
610,"I’m not schizophrenic, but I was once put on medication that made me experience similar symptoms—and when my psychiatrist told me to quit cold turkey, the symptoms worsened.
In short? It was hell.
I became extremely paranoid and believed that everyone hated me and wanted me dead. My skin crawled and itched so much that I scratched my arms raw trying to relieve the sensation. I started hearing things that weren’t there: wind chimes, high-pitched buzzing, frightened whispers of children.
“Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?”
I spent most of the first day of withdrawals curled up in bed with the lights off and a pillow shoved over my head, sobbing. The second day was a little better; I was able to go downstairs to interact with my family, but I was very unresponsive to most of their questions and the extent of my interaction with them was a long, blank stare.
Once the medication was out of my system, the symptoms disappeared, to my absolute and utter relief. It was one of the single most terrifying experiences of my life, even more so than my two encounters with death. I couldn’t trust what my own brain was telling me and thought I was going to go mad.
Schizophrenia is a mental illness. Does a condition that makes you experience hallucinations and memory problems sound like a gift?
If it does, that’s one hell of a shitty gift.",schizophrenia
611,"Schizophrenia is a twice as prevalent as Alzheimer’s disease. It is a group of disorders involving distortion of thought, emotion and perception.
There are positive and negative symptoms of Schizophrenia.
Positive symptom is when the person experiences something additional to his normal experience.
They experience hallucinations (visual and audible), paranoia, catatonic behavior, and delusion of persecution, control and grandeur.
Patients hears voices and sometimes they can visualize another person’s presence in the surrounding, but in reality no one is actually there. Sometimes they feel that someone is trying to kill them. Sometimes the voice in their head becomes controlling. The voices inside there head confuse them.
Going through this is strange, frightening and tough.
Positive symptom can be reduced with medications. But if the patient stops taking medicines, these symptoms can reappear.
Delusion of persecution makes them fear everybody around them. They see others as threat. Due to this, they can try to hurt other people, which might also include their loved ones.
Delusion of grandeur makes the schizophrenic feel powerful and different than others. Sometimes they consider the voices inside their head as the voices from other spiritual beings or angels or demons. They fantasize themselves as a chosen one for a particular task. Medication subside these thoughts. After treatment, patients feel as their power have been taken away. They feel dumb. Due to this they become reluctant to medicines.
Negative symptom is when a normal behavior, thought pattern or emotions are missing.
Disorganized speech, lack of emotions (apathy), lack of energy are its examples. These factors, most of the times, leads to poor social functioning.
Most of us have seen street beggars who keep mumbling with intensity but don't make any sense. Most of these people show symptoms of schizophrenia.
Due to lack of social functioning, schizophrenics gravitate towards being alone, sometimes they prefer to be homeless.
It is very difficult to reduce the negative symptoms with medications.
Schizophrenia is very challenging and hard to deal with. Patient’s behave and respond in a bizarre manner. Some patients try to run away from people, some try to run from themselves too.
Schizophrenics find it hard to differentiate between their imagination and the reality. We need to handle schizophrenic patients with a lot of care. Along with the schizophrenics, their family member goes through a lot too and need consistent support.
But many societies don’t accept these people and give them a hard time. Because of the fear of rejection from the society, some families abandon the family member who is suffering from this disorder.
I don’t believe that these experiences of schizophrenics is anywhere near to being called as a gift.",schizophrenia
612,"I know everyone is on this new philosophy that every single mental disorder or physical disorder is considered a “gift”. I have ADHD and an anxiety disorder and I just read a few weeks ago this ridiculous article about how ADHD is not considered something you want to “get rid of” or “get better from” but instead a gift that you should encourage people with ADHD to embrace and celebrate. They claim that telling kids with ADHD to get on meds to correct the problem is “telling them there is something wrong with them” instead of celebrating their “uniqueness”. It’s ridiculous. ADHD symptoms interfere with my day to day life, cause me to lose friendships, cause problems when I misplace things (like my phone, wallet, keys, important documents) keep me up at night because my brain can’t stop and then I get sick from lack of sleep, cause me to do poorly at work which can cause me to get fired. I can’t fulfill dreams I have, like traveling the world. So, without medication, ADHD is NOT something that is to be celebrated. It’s a disorder, something in the brain that was not supposed to be there. The PERSON should be celebrated, but not the disease.
Let me ask you this question…if you broke your leg, would you celebrate that? Would you tell the doctor “Don’t fix my leg. I consider my broken leg to be a gift. How dare you tell me that my broken leg is considered something that needs to be fixed, and not celebrated!” No, you get it fixed because you recognize that a broken leg is something that was not part of the original design, and it interferes with your ability to function in day-to-day activities.
Same thing with mental disorders. Any time something interferes with someone’s life in a negative way, it’s not a good thing. Hearing voices, seeing things that aren’t there, it can be dangerous. People have died because they have delusions that they can fly, some voice in their head told them to murder somebody, things that aren’t really there somehow got them into a vulnerable situation. Or, the people who were in their life became alienated, the person lost all their friends, and fell into depression.
I feel like I need to clarify. The PERSON with a disability should ALWAYS be celebrated. If the PERSON with the disability says “I like the way I am. I want to celebrate my condition as a part of me.” Then of course, celebrate with that person! It’s their disability after all. But it’s kind of a slap in the face to tell someone with a disability to “celebrate their disability because it makes you unique” because more likely than not, that person is NOT celebrating. They are probably struggling internally in ways you can’t imagine. Always celebrate the person, though. Because of their battle, they are likely very strong and resiliant.",schizophrenia
613,"Because for me it is terrifying. I'm on meds now but when I first got ill I was absolutely petrified for nearly a year. I thought I was going to be killed, I was absolutely convinced of it. I couldn't sleep properly , I went to bed covered in water so if I was set on fire it might stop it. I couldn't eat certain things in case of poison. I lost my job , my relationship. I thought demons were reading my thoughts and controlling me. It's not a gift in any way ,shape or form.",schizophrenia
614,"I have schizophrenia and it is a problem! I don’t want the voices in my head. They keep me from living my life! I don’t feel like I can do anything normal such as working a job, owning a house, or having a relationship. I can’t ignore them and sometimes they bring me to tears.
I don’t want to feel tactile sensations of something touching me. I always feel something gripping my right shoulder. I also get a feeling of something crawling on the left side of my ribs or on my back. Other times, I feel something crawling underneath me or under my pillow when I’m trying to sleep.
There is nothing positive about having a mental illness.
It’s not a gift! It’s a curse!
But, hey, whatever you have to tell yourself to make you feel better.",schizophrenia
615,"Because it is a problem.
I’d like to clarify that the people with the illness are not a “problem” and too many people suffering this condition feel that way. They’re not a burden, they have a sickness.
I’m not sure if you’re a troll or not, but I’m going to treat this as a serious question.
Perhaps you don’t know, but proposing schizophrenia to be a “gift” is… insulting.
How exactly is schizophrenia a gift? How is hearing voices, seeing demon creatures, believing yourself to be pursued by “people with guns” (as one of my mother’s patients said) a “gift”?
A constant voice in the back of your head. Not only distracting, but whispering horrible things to you. Not just a noise, a negative presence.
You can’t sleep because you see shadow people in the corner of the room, you hear noises and the voices are screaming at you now. Screaming and saying that you’re “worthless” and that “nobody ever loved you”, over and over. They don’t stop.
I can’t even begin to understand how terrifying that must be. It is far, far from a gift.
These people are scared and alone. They are forced to believe the things in their head. They think they’re going to die or that they hurt someone or that they are possessed by a demon. They almost never believe positive things, I assure you.
It’s not a gift.",schizophrenia
616,"A gift beyond measure, absolutely, despite the suffering involved I would NOT be the person, poet and artist i am today without my having suffered the diagnosis of schizophrenia for more than 40 years. And do not doubt that I suffered. just to be brief, command hallucinations led me to set my left leg on fire at one point, and I had to have skin grafts to heal and be able to walk. Over the years, these same Command Hallucinations led me to severely burning my face (“Deface your face!”) more than once.
Nevertheless, and not despite this extreme example but because of it, I am grateful for having borne this diagnosis — with all the accompanying symptoms most of my adult life. Without it I might not have learned the compassion and ability to listen to others than I have now. I might not have come to meet so many wonderful others, also wrongly imprisoned in Psychiatric hospitals. I might never have come to understand the value in being in the here and now…I would have missed so much!
So yes, I am grateful for my escape from the brutalities of the mental health system and hospitals, but I would never exchange my life with schizophrenia (now behind me) for a fortune or any successful career history or anything in the world. Everything that has happened in my life, happened for a reason, and that was to bring me here, to a place of love, joy and acceptance. I believe that the diagnosis and experience of schizophrenia was essential to that. So Yes, schizophrenia was a gift to me, and I would not change my history of it no matter what you offered.",schizophrenia
617,"Because of how it most commonly presents itself.
Every positive symptom of schizophrenia is influenced by your subconscious. If you have the slightest amount of depression or insecurities, then that is how the hallucinations will present themselves.
The voices, which are the most common positive symptom, are caused by a disconnect between your mind and recognizing your own internal medication. When depression or even low self esteem are present on rinternal monologue isn't exactly the cheerleader we all need.
When you're telling yourself that you are a horrible person and that you need to kill yourself, combined with the fact that your mind has a disconnect and it appears that you're hearing this externally rather than from your own mind (which is already hell) so you're hearing external voices about how much you suck and need to end it, that's pretty far from a “gift” isn't it?
Now, if you're schizoagfective instead then that depression is going to be amplified by ten.
You have to realize that most people experience these extremely negative symptoms and that questions like this not only actively shit on those who are suffering from this, but this kind of dismissal gets people killed. There's a lot of misunderstanding and stigma associated with psychosis and they don't need this kind of bullshit question. It gets people killed.",schizophrenia
618,"I don’t think of it as a gift. My identical twin sister has it, and I too am exhibiting symptoms of it. No I’m not self diagnosing, but I have had similar experiences. It is not a gift.

I feel more and more withdrawn from people and society, and and even reality itself, but at least I can realize it, unlike some people who are very ill.",schizophrenia
619,"Because it’s a serious mental illness? I don’t get this current trend of thinking mental health disorders are gifts. Yes, we’re all unique and special and that’s great. But sometimes you just have to call things what they are. Mental illnesses aren’t gifts. They are disorders. They cause problems for the people who have them. They’re not fun. They get the people who have them in trouble, make relationships difficult, make keeping a job difficult, sometimes cause suicidal or other dangerous thinking or actions.",schizophrenia
620,"To put it simply,… because it takes the afflicted people away from who they love and us from them.
The symptoms of schizophrenia and psychosis cause people to live in a world where so much of what they experience is different than us. They don’t want it to be that way, it just is.
I would always say to my person, “if u tell me there’s a purple dinosaur outside, I’m always going to take ur word for it and go look.”
The problem is, after a while, and about 100,000 checks outside for that purple dinosaur, one gets tired.
I would scream.. “How many times do I have to look!…there’s no purple dinosaur here!!!”
He would say, “How many times do I have to tell u…he’s always there. Even when I don’t talk about him, he’s always there.”
This was how we would describe the aching difference in our realities.
Eventually, he became fixated on the idea that I was only with him to gather intel about him for the govt and that I was paid to do so. Followed by him believing I had somehow faked my own death while I was making breakfast. You can’t make this stuff up. One could find it funny; or unbelievable, until it happens to you and the person you love.
I remember him accusing me of these things, the last one being about faking my own death. I could feel the wind leaving my body. I couldn’t wrap my head around the idea that he truly believed these things. I knew around that time that he was never going to be the same person I had known him to be.
Within a year he became unpredictable, incoherent, and even violent at times. He could no longer be around my children. He had been amazing with them, and amazing with me. He was so sharp and witty. Handled himself like a true gentleman.
He was predisposed with a family history of mental illness. One weekend, he made a mistake and decided to take a hit of acid. It turned out not being what he thought and was a triple dipped, extremely strong form of lsd. It triggered the schizophrenia and he has been afflicted with auditory and visual hallucinations as well as exteme paranoia ever since. Basically, he never came back after that night. It’s a world of torture.
I looked into the idea that someone may be enlightened or that this is a type of calling, or religious ordain for a little while. That is until I watched the person I love more then life be tortured by his own mind until there was nothing left.

629,"Some people do. Generally it’s two types with one unifying factor: spirituality. That’s not to say that everyone who believes it’s spiritual thinks it’s a positive thing- rather those that consider it a gift are usually more spiritually minded.
The first type is one who doesn’t have the illness, but is perhaps a medium or psychic. Often - not always, they have a rather simplified version of this illness which is focused on positive symptoms, not negative ones. Positive being added things, negative being taken away. Example - I get hallucinations; I’ve lost my desire to be social.
The second type is someone on the schizophrenia spectrum who may not be experiencing horrific symptoms like abusive hallucinations; they might be having more beneficial experiences. Example: when I visually hallucinate (which is about 10–25 percent of my hallucinations) it’s usually very dark. Mutilated corpses, rotted or charred. Someone else might see light, angels- things of that nature.
I think that the key word here is to recognize that this experience will be different things to different people. As no one of us has an authoritative position it’s important to acknowledge these different ways.
And as you’ve figured - for me it is not a gift.",schizophrenia
630,"Good question about a serious illness that has been around for over 100 years!
The term Schizophrenia was founded in 1911 and is among the most stigmatised mental disorders. Moreover, the term schizophrenia tends to evoke thoughts of violence in lay persons and our media executives.
Since the term was coined and its sufferers labelled, a number of events throughout history has made things worse for those diagnosed with schizophrenia and their families.
For example, during WW2, the NAZIS killed or sterilised between 220,000 and 269,500 people that were thought to have schizophrenia.
Moreover, there was also a push to do the same to the families of people with schizophrenia because it was thought that it was a hereditary disorder that needed to be eliminated.
After the war (the 1960’s) the same theory began to re-emerge throughout the world (including the West). Instead of killing people, a program of sterilising people with schizophrenia was undertaken.
In many instances authorities (hidden from the public) in consultation with mental institutions proceeded to sterilise mental health inpatients. The same inhumane policies were used for other disorders, especially intellectual disability, dwarfism and other congenital defects.
Today, our civilised society screens for certain mental and physical disorders in pregnant women. Pregnant women were and are encouraged (by government and doctors) to terminate their pregnancies if their babies had a high chance of developing the above-mentioned disorders and disabilities.
The social stigma associated with schizophrenia is worldwide, probably less in the West, however, I cannot make that claim with any confidence.
Nature of schizophrenia symptoms
What scares people the most is the nature of the symptoms, especially the psychotic symptoms. Losing control of reality and our senses can be a scary thing!
Many people imagine killer psychotic schizophrenics loose in the streets looking for prey (thanks for movies and sensational reporting of the news). I’ve fielded a couple of questions on Quora related to safety in a neighbourhood of a schizophrenic.
Discrimination
People from minority groups (I.e., sexuality, nationality, religion, ect.) know what it feels like to be singled out for being different.
Fear appears to be a learnt human behaviour, that also involves marginalising, and discriminating against those that are different from the majority.
Dominant society discourse
Dominant discourse in our society is pushed by comedians, television, and radio, trends, and so on. Marginalised discourse is punished by marginalising and other means.
A number of isolated incidents that involved schizophrenia suffers being violent and explored by movie plots, sitcoms and other sources. We need to have a statutory authority that calls out factually incorrect and disturbed Messges!
Dominant discourse in our society about Schizophrenia
News and current affairs shows and sensationalist tabloids always seem to have stories about schizophrenic violence. They report it in a way that normalises it or legitimises it (their reporting of it).
Even discussion about government policy is not spared. For example, ""the government’s policy on refugees or about education is schizophrenic"".
How many times have you heard the term schizophrenic used in this context?
Movies and regular television shows (sitcoms like Friends and Seinfeld) and more recent ones such as Mom, ""Regular Show"" tend to label anyone with a weird look, or mental illness as being schizophrenic. In particular, our media has a love affair with the use of the term “paranoid schizophrenic"".
Unfortunately our society has a long history of stigmatising people with schizophrenia and their families. The current trend does not seem to be changing.
Public awareness campaigns focus on high prevalence disorders leaving out schizophrenia
Most public awareness campaigns that I have seen or participated in have tended to focus on Anxiety and Depression and other high prevalence disorders.
Government and NGO's tend to leave out schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses out of their public awareness campaigns. This occurs due to the complexity of schizophrenia and the fact that a small percentage of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Government and NGO education and health promotion strategies are often driven by economic factors. For example, education campaigns about depression and anxiety will reach more people compared to schizophrenia campaigns.
We need to see a significant change in the way our society treats minorities and a change to the dominant discourse about these matters.

631,"Types of schizophrenia
There are several types of schizophrenia.
Paranoid schizophrenia
This is the most common form of schizophrenia. It may develop later in life than other types of schizophrenia. Symptoms include hallucinations and/or delusions, but your speech and emotions may not be affected.
Hebephrenic schizophrenia
Also called ‘disorganised schizophrenia’, this type of schizophrenia usually develops when you are 15-25 years old. Symptoms include disorganised behaviours and thoughts, alongside short-lasting delusions and hallucinations. You may have disorganised speech patterns and others may find it difficult to understand you.
People with disorganised schizophrenia often show little or no emotions in their facial expressions, voice tone, or mannerisms. At times they have inappropriate emotional responses to the situation, such as laughing at something sad.
Catatonic schizophrenia
This is the rarest schizophrenia diagnosis, characterised by unusual, limited and sudden movements. You may often switch between being very active or very still. You may not talk much, and you may mimic other’s speech and movement.
Undifferentiated schizophrenia
Your diagnosis may have some signs of paranoid, hebephrenic or catatonic schizophrenia, but it doesn’t obviously fit into one of these types alone.
Residual schizophrenia
You may be diagnosed with residual schizophrenia if you have a history of psychosis, but only experience the negative symptoms (for example; slow movement, poor memory, lack of concentration and poor hygiene).
Simple schizophrenia
With simple schizophrenia, the negative symptoms (for example; slow movement, poor memory, lack of concentration and poor hygiene) are most prominent early and will get worse. It is rare to experience positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, disorganised thinking).
Cenesthopathic schizophrenia
People with cenesthopathic schizophrenia experience unusual bodily sensations.
Unspecified schizophrenia
Symptoms meet the general conditions for a diagnosis, but do not fit in to any of the above categories.
Types of schizophrenia - Mental Health UK",schizophrenia
632,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by a breakdown of thought processes and an impaired ability to understand reality. Common symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disordered thinking, and a lack of motivation.
There are several subtypes of schizophrenia, including:
Paranoid schizophrenia, characterized by delusions of persecution or grandeur
Disorganized schizophrenia, characterized by disorganized speech and behavior
Catatonic schizophrenia, characterized by a lack of movement or a decreased range of emotions
Residual schizophrenia, characterized by a decline in symptoms after a period of active psychosis
Undifferentiated schizophrenia, characterized by symptoms that do not fit into any of the other subtypes.
It's worth noting that the above classification of subtypes are not universally used. Nowadays, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on the criteria in the Diagn and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Clinicians assess the presence and duration of the symptoms, the level of functional impairment, and the patient's history to arrive at a diagnosis.

633,"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand reality. It is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood and affects approximately 1% of the population.
There are three main types of schizophrenia:
Paranoid schizophrenia: This type is characterized by delusions and hallucinations, often related to a specific theme or paranoia about being persecuted or harmed.
2. Disorganized schizophrenia: This type is characterized by disorganized speech and behavior, as well as flat or inappropriate emotions and difficulty with daily functioning.
3. Catatonic schizophrenia: This type is characterized by unusual movements or behaviors, such as remaining in a fixed position for a long period of time or repeating words or actions.
In addition to these types, there is also undifferentiated schizophrenia, which includes symptoms from multiple types, and residual schizophrenia, which refers to individuals who have had a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia but are currently experiencing milder symptoms.

634,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia
635,"Paranoid schizophrenia: The person’s paranoia may be extreme, and they may act on it. “They may show up at the door of the FBI and ask, ‘Why are you following me?” They may also behave oddly, have inappropriate emotional responses and show little pleasure in life.
Catatonic schizophrenia: The person shuts down emotionally, mentally and physically. “People appear to be paralyzed. They have no facial expression and may stand still for long periods of time,” she says. There is no drive to eat, drink or urinate. When catatonia lasts for hours, it becomes a medical emergency.
Undifferentiated schizophrenia:The person has various vague symptoms. “They may not talk or express themselves much. They can be confused and paranoid”. The person may not bother to change clothes or take a shower.
Schizoaffective disorder: The person has delusional thinking and other symptoms of schizophrenia. “But they also present with one or more symptoms of a mood disorder: depression, mania and/or hypomania,”",schizophrenia
636,"“Schizophrenia” doesn’t exist, people are hearing from spirits and being given visions and caused to believe lies because of this. Some are tormented, some are convinced they are “chosen or prophets”.
The way intellectuals categorize this is by patterns of activity in a brain scan which means nothing. If you have said pattern voila you have this disorder and now they can legally diagnose you and drug you up without fear of malpractice or misdiagnosis.
These scans simply point out that the brain is being unusually active or more active in certain areas which is obvious.
They do not know why, how or how to cure it which is the key part that isn’t obvious to “medical professionals”. Although I suspect that at the tippy tippy top of this industry as well as a select few who are conducting this research… people know fully what is going on.

Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
SEEING THINGS THAT ARE NOT THERE OR VISIONS, NIGHT TERRORS

637,"Schizophrenia is a mental health condition associated with unusual expressions or perceptions of reality. It can lead to significant social or occupational dysfunction.
There are different kinds of schizophrenia. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) manual describes them as below.
Paranoid schizophrenia
Common form of schizophrenia.
Prominent hallucinations and/or delusions.
May develop at a later age than other types of schizophrenia.
Speech and emotions may be unaffected.
Hebephrenic schizophrenia
Disorganised behaviour without purpose.
Disorganised thoughts: other people may find it difficult to understand you.
Pranks, giggling, health complaints and grimacing.
Short-lasting delusions and hallucinations.
Usually develops between 15 and 25 years old.
Catatonic schizophrenia
Rarer than other types.
Unusual movements, often switching between being very active and very still.
You may not talk at all.
Undifferentiated schizophrenia
Your diagnosis may have some signs of paranoid, hebephrenic or catatonic schizophrenia, but doesn’t obviously fit into one of these types alone.
Residual schizophrenia
You may be diagnosed with this if you have a history of psychosis but only have negative symptoms.
Simple schizophrenia
Rarely diagnosed in the UK.
Negative symptoms are prominent early and get worse quickly.
Positive symptoms are rare.
Cenesthopathic schizophrenia
People with cenesthopathic schizophrenia experience unusual bodily sensations.
Unspecified schizophrenia
Symptoms meet the general conditions for a diagnosis, but do not fit in to any of the above categories.

638,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
639,"I can give you the different kinds of schizophrenia listed in the DSM-5, but you can look that up yourself. The truth is schizophrenia is a psyco-spiritual disease caused by spiritual entities. So, there as many different kinds of schizophrenia as there are people. The dynamics between the person and spirit are different for each case.
The establishment, Phama, and the APA to name a few organizations working with secret societies have put a great deal off effort into convincing the world that schizophrenia is a chemical imbalance that causes hallucinations and delusions that needs to be treated with anti-psychotic drugs. The truth is that trolls from these organizations will attack this immediately because they have infiltrated everything. They have financial interests, and a much darker reason for hiding this simple truth.
The system they have in place is making billions off of the pain and suffering of millions of people will spiritual attachments that need reconciliation not drugs. Drugs only manage the condition. It's going to take really hard work to recover ccompletely. Some psychiatrists do actually believe that they are helping people, bless there hearts. They are also being deceived.
Watching a psychologist that has no idea what they are talking about besides regurgitating the malarkey they were taught in school to a suffering patient is torment for them. They know deep inside that what they are experiencing are not “auditory hallucinations” but hearing spirits. They eventually get beat down enough or in some cases stop trying to tell the truth. I they don't conform to the excepted paradigm they won't “get better"" when actually there was nothing wrong with them to begin with.
The origins of schizophrenia have been know to mankind for thousands of years. Don't you think it's funny that with the invention of psych medication the condition has now become a chemical imbalance that needs to be treated PERMANENTLY (consequently making phama billions). People are starting to realize that they are being lied to and one day we will be able to focus on the real problem. This is what the power elite and status quo call “crazy talk"" when in fact it's quite the opposite.",schizophrenia
640,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
641,"There are no types of schizophrenia in the DSM-V diagnostic manual. The types of schizophrenia were removed, and for very good reasons.

642,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.

643,"There are various types of Schizophrenia, but the 4 main types are paranoid, Catatonic, Undifferentiated, and schizoaffective disorder
Paranoid schizophrenia: The suffering individual may have extreme paranoia, and they believe and act on it. The common beliefs are of- being spied on, people following them everywhere, being watched, etc to be unsafe, people around trying to harm them, trusted people being imposters, and many more. They act oddly on all their beliefs and have extreme and inappropriate emotional responses.
Catatonic schizophrenia: The person shuts down emotionally, mentally, and physically. They get paralyzed and stand still for a long period of time. They lose the drive to basic functions like eating, drinking, urinating, or even swallowing saliva.
Undifferentiated schizophrenia: The person has various symptoms. They seem confused and are not able to express themselves. They are unbothered by their hygiene.
Schizoaffective disorder: The suffering individual has delusional and disorganized thinking. They often have a comorbidity of one or more symptoms of mood disorders like depression, mania, etc.",schizophrenia
644,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
645,"The different types are different because they have different causes. If you have trauma and that causes you to hear voices that is one thing. If you begin a spiritual relationship and that causes you to hear voices that is an entirely different thing.
Honestly, many things that get called schizophrenia are being unjustly insulted. Literal Schizophrenia is a mental disorder, but not everything called “Schizophrenia” is a mental disorder. Some people can hear God. This is a truth accepted by most of the world’s religions. Like 70% of the planet. It is a fool that thinks over 5 billion people from a variety of backgrounds are simply misinformed, and yet…
Psychology falls into the category of a science, but many take psychology beyond that scope and into the realm of scientism. To be clear, there are those that believe that anything not explained by science is simply not. Their philosophy is “We’re right, your wrong.” I think Shakespeare said it well when he wrote “there is more in Heaven and on Earth that is dreamt of in your philosophy…”
So, among things that get called “schizophrenia” there are spiritual gifts, spiritual oppression, and literal mental illness. I wish psychology, since it specializes only in mental illness, would stay in their lane.",schizophrenia
646,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
647,"As of recently, there is only one type that is recognized- schizophrenia.

648,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia
649,"If you do a google search, you’ll find out that the DSM-IV used to classify different types of schizophrenia - paranoid, disorganized, residual, catatonic, and undifferentiated.

“This rule suggests that about 25% of people with schizophrenia will recover completely from the first episode and go on to have no further problems in their life.

People would be more forth coming with the truth of this if they weren’t threatened with being locked up in a psychiatric ward or risking their entire careers as well as being mocked and ridiculed by alleged “experts” and other colleagues.
Even the prosecutor I spoke to who was signing petitions to have these people picked up for mandatory evaluations admitted he knew something was wrong about this and he felt like he was “locking up God’s people”. The man resigned from his position 3 weeks later.

They will become more frugal
They will become wiser
They will be less reliant on health care
They will be less engaged in consumerism
They will begin to understand the truth of the corruption of the world and stop taking part in it
They will realize world systems of religion are a lie.
Truth will spread
Billions will be lost in healthcare dollars annually

652,"There is no known cure for schizophrenia.
The best that we can hope for, is effective symptom management…and sometimes periods of symptom remission. Both of those are considered a great victory.
Why hasn’t there been a cure for schizophrenia? Advocacy.
Schizophrenia affects about 1 in 100 people….yet, the people affected are also the least able to advocate for their own care, treatments or cures.
They are not like Breast Cancer where the victim is often able to advocate, or Autism (that have active parental involvement). People with schizophrenia are often the most compromised, people who are often forgotten, who families sometimes abandon, and who often have very few people actively in their corner.
It breaks my heart.
People with schizophrenia grow up much like you and I. They have dreams, hopes, things they want for their life….and often (not always), these things are stolen from them in the most terrible of ways, and they are left to fend for themselves at a time when they are most compromised in their abilities.

654,"No it’s not a choice.
Here is a definition of schizophrenia From the American Psychiatric Association at psychiatry.org:
“Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than one percent of the U.S. population. When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation. However, with treatment, most symptoms of schizophrenia will greatly improve and the likelihood of a recurrence can be diminished.
While there is no cure for schizophrenia, research is leading to innovative and safer treatments. Experts also are unraveling the causes of the disease by studying genetics, conducting behavioral research, and using advanced imaging to look at the brain’s structure and function. These approaches hold the promise of new, and more effective therapies.
The complexity of schizophrenia may help explain why there are misconceptions about the disease. Schizophrenia does not mean split personality or multiple-personality. Most people with schizophrenia are not any more dangerous or violent than people in the general population. While limited mental health resources in the community may lead to homelessness and frequent hospitalizations, it is a misconception that people with schizophrenia end up homeless or living in hospitals. Most people with schizophrenia live with their family, in group homes or on their own.
Research has shown that schizophrenia affects men and women fairly equally but may have an earlier onset in males. Rates are similar around the world. People with schizophrenia are more likely to die younger than the general population, largely because of high rates of co-occurring medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.”
I have schizophrenia and I hear demonic voices. They are obtrusive thoughts that know are not my own. They are against God. They blaspheme the Holy Spirit. They promote Satan to me and try to get me to turn away from God and worship the devil, which is something that I will NEVER DO!

655,"Yes I do. That labels me “crazy.”
I get told a lot, “You don't seem like you have schizophrenia.” “You don't look like you have it.”
When I'm alone with my mind - is when it's the worst. If I'm not on meds? Forget it, It's just a downward spiral. Everyone's out to get me. What was that?? Omg, they are talking about me. Do I smell? Some of the agonizing thoughts I have daily. That's when I am taking my meds..
Now without them?(aka a psychosis) My family hates me. My daughter is going to forget me.. There are bugs everywhere in my house, in my hair, in my clothes, etc. *Buys bug foggers and lice shampoo* Falls into a deep depression. Lays on the couch for days at a time without eating or showering. *Cuts up furniture because people are inside it.* *Pulls outlets out from the walls because I'm being watched.*
To live with it? It's absolutely awful, every day is a struggle and being sober every day is a struggle. I'm fighting 2 demons at the same time but I refuse to let them win.
I came home this past weekend from a long-term rehab program. I got to see my wonderful daughter. When I'm with her everything is right in the world. I forget all about my schizophrenia and addiction. I am 4 1/2 months sober today.",schizophrenia

658,"Sadly, I'm positive those living with schizophrenia (doesn't matter which part of the spectrum) they wish to stop suffering for one day. My husband grew up in Guatemala, his birth came near the end of the genocide. Neglected and left behind by his mom, dad was not able to be a dad (even though his dad was right there), only person my husband trusted was his maternal grandfather who knew my husband was “special” until the grandfather died one day. My husband lived with severe abuse with his maternal aunt, husband and children. He is 52 and still suffers mentally. His schizophrenia is a result of delusions, hallucinations and a whole community of “voices” with faces and personalities. Many times, I ask him who he is talking to or I need to ask who am I talking with.",schizophrenia
659,"Usually from what I understand people get Schizophrenia from suffering a very stressful event in there life and having a family history of it is a major factor in turning that stressful event into a psychosis. Drug use can also increase the chances of become schizophrenic; drugs such as LSD and Meth especially. There is actuall changes in brain chemistry of a schizophrenic, Why would anyone think it is a choice? Because it is a terrible experience to exist with schizophrenia, medication only reduces it’s severity and is not a cure. It is possible though that people with schizophrenia gained certain abilities and understanding’s because of the change they went through. Just as someone who uses LSD sometimes come’s away from it with knew insights and knowledge, that’s just my opinion.",schizophrenia
660,"No one chooses to have mental illness, any more than someone chooses to get cancer.
Some people do not believe that there is a decent treatment (and sometimes their mental illness leads them to that idea), and so do nothing to get treated.
Some people do everything they can to get treated for mental illness, but are not successful.
But most people who are treated for mental illness do manage to get some relief, and lots of people with mental illness get significant relief. Though accomplishing relief from mental illness can take a lot of time and effort, and trial and error (with treatments, therapists, and medications).
It is not possible to “make” ones self become schizophrenic. It is possible to avoid treatment, and therefore maintain the schizophrenia as a choice. But I’ve known some schizophrenic people who “chose” to avoid treatment, as a result of having schizophrenia. That is, they were of the opinion that the treatments were meant to do something nefarious to them. This was due to the paranoia that was part of their mental illness.
When paranoia is part of the problem, I don’t blame the victim for wanting to avoid treatment. This is exactly why some people need to have help imposed on them. Until they have gotten some treatment, they are lost in their paranoid delusions, and the decisions they make are based on that.",schizophrenia
661,"No, schizophrenia is definitely not a decision. It's a complex psychological sickness portrayed by disturbances in manners of thinking, discernments, and feelings. Schizophrenia emerges from a blend of hereditary, natural, and neurobiological factors, going with it nowhere near a cognizant choice. People with schizophrenia experience a scope of side effects, including mind flights, hallucinations, confused thinking, and hindered social working, which fundamentally influence their regular routines. The beginning of schizophrenia commonly happens in late immaturity or early adulthood, frequently abruptly or control from the person. While specific way of life elements or stressors could fuel side effects, they don't decide the improvement of the disease. It's significant to comprehend that faulting people for their schizophrenia propagates shame and false impressions about psychological wellness. Treatment for schizophrenia includes a blend of prescription, treatment, and backing administrations pointed toward overseeing side effects and working on personal satisfaction. Notwithstanding, it's critical to perceive that looking for treatment and sticking to it very well may be trying because of the idea of the disease, including side effects like absence of understanding or neurosis. Seeing schizophrenia as a decision sabotages the intricacy of the condition and the requirement for thorough help and understanding from society.",schizophrenia
662,"No, and it’s a laughable notion. It’s probably not a good testament for your relationship that your boyfriend holds this position. If a person could choose to remove say, bipolar, there would not be such a high suicide rate with those afflicted.

663,"Thanks for the A2A.
When the child was young, if some sort of trauma and abuse was a factor in triggering the onset of their narcissism, some argue it’s hard for a child to know about that choice.
On the other hand, it is false to suggest child abuse causes narcissism. Many people who were abused as children are highly empathetic people and would never repeat the cycle of abuse given what they have been through.
I am very sceptical of child abuse being given as a reason for having that level of narcissism. From what I have observed, any excuse for their actions will do. It rather seems to stem from a sense of entitlement that is out of proportion to the other aspects of their personality.
Regardless of what causes it and what the latest research states, the fact remains they aren’t out of touch with reality and are making a choice. They cover up their wrongdoings very well.
Criminals make choices to do bad things, it’s not pleasant but there it is.
Perhaps the difference with narcissists is that they want to do the bad things but reframe themselves and their actions as good. They want “good guy privileges” publicly while secretly doing bad things. I suppose that’s all abusers though.
Narcissists that are highly self-aware and use that self-awareness to inflict maximum damage on decent people quietly living their lives don’t have much of a case for why they do what they do.
Unfortunately the ones who reach middle age that are like that have repetitively over time boosted their self esteem through cutting down others and getting a buzz off it. They feel good when they have the power to devastate people. That’s where the smirk comes from. It is the same as an addict getting high off their supply.
These patterns and coping mechanisms that people use to feel better and regulate their self esteem are very hard to break.
Narcissists have worked very hard to try to make all their wrongs right over time and many enjoy it. Some have periods where they loathe themselves but then they hurt another person and feel on top of the world again.
It is the same sort of choice alcoholics make. I’ve known two addicts. One drank themselves to death and the other is alive, sober, happy and a totally different person from when they were using.
Is it easy to stop drinking if you become an alcoholic? No. But is it possible? Yes if you do the work and are committed to it.
Like many addictions, in order to beat them, you have to decide that your coping mechanism isn’t healthy and also be committed to change no matter how hard it gets.
Narcissism itself is a tough one because in many ways it appears at least to them and their often shallow concept of rewards that they are “rewarded” so they think it is a superior lifestyle choice.
Or their self-pity is such that they say it’s impossible for them to change and it’s unfair they can’t love so they’re entitled to crap all over other people’s lives.
They alternate a lot between different positions to avoid genuine introspection. More and more excuses. Narcissistic thinking offers so many excuses to use to avoid ever having to do anything differently.
With any unhealthy behaviours, it really comes down to the person doing them choosing that no matter how hard it is, they don’t want to be that person any more.
Unfortunately narcissists see people as supply and supply is everywhere so most just keep moving from one supply to the next, circling back to exes when they need to and the exes let them.
And they have all sorts of tools at their disposal to protect themselves from genuine introspection - they can lurch from smugly smirking about their victory but when that makes them feel bad because it’s unseemly what they did, they can throw in so much self-pity to get themselves off the hook, ones I’ve heard include “if it wasn’t for my parents, I’d have a better life. It’s their fault I’m the way I am”, “my mother was a narcissist so I am one too”, “my counsellor should recognise that I admit I do a lot of crap but instead they’re frustrated with me. She should be happy she’s got someone taking responsibility for their mistakes.”
Except the responsibility for that person and most narcissists never actually extends to stopping doing those mistakes.
I do take my hat off to narcissists genuinely trying to lessen the negative impact of their behaviour on others but unfortunately they’re the exception not the rule.
It is certainly quite easy to sink into a narcissistic lifestyle over time and to just keep embracing the short-term shallow rewards of ego strokes. It takes a tremendous amount of balls to work at creating a more meaningful life.
Narcissists are certainly capable of making better choices but the unpleasant truth is that many are simply not interested in that.
They really do like and want different things from the rest of us. Nothing’s gonna change their world except them.
And the truth is most of them are in love with their false world and the false stories they tell themselves about who they are.
They think their manipulation skills to get what they want is how they demonstrate their value in the world.
Many think they are exceedingly clever. But if we all wanted to, many of us could train ourselves to do what they do over time. But the world truly does not need more narcissists.
They have chosen the shallow life and we must let them make that choice but they should not feel compelled to coerce others who have different goals to also live that lifestyle.
Let them invite other people into their world who think like them and leave the rest of us out of it.",schizophrenia

665,"Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental health condition which is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, language and behaviour. It includes hallucinations which can be auditory, visual or tactile in nature. A person affected by schizophrenia often harbours beliefs which are false in nature and exist in the form of delusions.
There may be disorganised speech, which maybe incoherent and/or irrelevant. A person experiences issues with emotions, in the form of a general apathy or a mismatch between real feelings and expression. There may be an inability to understand information and further problems with attention and focus.
A person experiencing negative symptoms may require additional help with managing everyday routine. One area which requires attention is self hygiene.Depending on the intensity of the illness, one is able to manage everyday functioning.
It is important to understand that it is a mental disorder which impairs overall functioning and therefore it is important to be well aware of how to deal with the illness as caregivers. For an individual experiencing schizophrenia, an effective treatment plan can be laid out to ensure that the symptoms are managed. As family members, support can be a pivotal element. Making sure that the medical treatment is followed up regularly can be advantageous.",schizophrenia

667,"I can answer this based on experience. First, how old is your brother, I'm guessing in late teens to older twenties. Usually it gets diagnosed around 16 to 18. My brother was 17 when he had a breakdown at work. He had signs from a young age at mental illness, very moody, anxiety, extreme outbursts.. but my parents wouldn't believe it, they saw mental illnesses as some failing on their part, would never take him to psychiatrist. Fast forward, my dad is gone, my mom dies, only me and my sister are left to care for my brother, I'm 22 at the time she is 20, he is 19. We both work full time, he gets social security after a 2 year battle. The next 10 years, this is my example, I can't say if it will be the same for you, were a complete nightmare. The doctors, nothing against them they do their best many are very caring and this is hard, kept diagnosing him with various mental illness. New medication, New treatment, random break downs, hospital stays, institutions, back home, repeat. FOR TEN YEARS. At my expense and his welfare. My sister helped as she could but eventually had her own family. So, after all this I am 33, My brother is 30, he is on medication, in a mental health facility similar to a nursing home, going to college, on social security, eventually will move to an assisted living apartment, I still help support him. This is as good as it can be for him and I. He has trouble everyday with things that I can't even really understand. At the same time, while I want to help all I can, there are limitations. He does much better in a supervised, regimented, organized, social, environment. In all the years living at home with me, regular life was too much, he couldn't keep track of medication, doctor visits, personal hygiene, cleaning up after himself, trying to go to school. It wore us both out. Finally, in the setting he is now we are both much happier, and he is more like himself. So, you can have a life, a real life,but it may come with some limitations, I hope this helps.",schizophrenia
668,"Whoever thinks mental illness is a “choice” is just woefully ignorant. Who would conceivably choose such misery? No one! The ignorant are certainly not alone. As another writer here pointed out , the United States as a nation is shockingly indifferent to the plight of the mentally ill—especially children who suffer from this agonizing condition.
My mental illness expressed itself as deep depression. Twice it led me to such despair I attempted suicide. Were these“merely” cries for help? They certainly didn’t feel like it. I wanted to end the terrible suffering. Permanently. In the second attempt I was maybe two minutes from bleeding out when saved by fast moving EMTs.
I am now fine, thanks to a brilliant psychiatrist. He found the right mix of medication to “put me right.” I take four meds daily. While I’ve had normal “down” periods, I have not had a depressive episode since 2008. If you are suffering from depression I urge you to get with a good psychiatrist and get the MEDICATION you need. While “talk therapy” can help, only meds can end depression or any mental illness.
Conditions like depression are due to chemical imbalances in the brain. Work with your psychiatrist to find just the right med mix for you. Only a psychiatrist can prescribe meds.
Those who want to know about true depression should read William Styron’s “Darkness Visible.” For years my mother discounted my depression as my just being “quiet” or had “the blues.” Then she read “Darkness Visible” and the scales fell from her eyes. She finally understood. I found it ironic that she couldn’t understand it from her own son. It took a brilliant author to enlighten her about this terrible and little understood scourge: mental illness.
Maybe that’s the case in your family….",schizophrenia
669,"I would say that “normal” doesn’t really exist, but I guess I know what you mean.
A person with schizophrenia can lead a life that is fulfilling. They might also live a life that is “normal” I suppose. It depends on the person really. If by “normal” you mean working 40+ hours a week at a job, having a spouse and children, and participating in life in a sort of “normal” way…yes I guess it is possible, but I would say that for most people who have schizophrenia there would be some kind of alternative formation of what is “normal.”
You have to remember that having schizophrenia still means that you are living with a disability, so the disability has to be managed in some way. Most people who have schizophrenia will need to be stabilized on medications in order to lead a “normal”-ish life, so that in itself is a bit not “normal.” In the US that means that someone with schizophrenia will have to have access to medical care usually through some kind of health insurance. In the US that means you need to either have a job with medical coverage, you need to be wealthy, or you need to be on something like disability and receiving government health coverage in some way. So, let’s say someone is more “normal” and they have a regular job that provides health insurance. Not only will the job be stressful, but there will be stress from having to worry about if they lose the job that they will lose insurance and lose medical coverage which provides medications that keep them sane. In essence, there’s kind of a lot riding on the job with medical insurance, and it adds a lot of stress. But what is bad for schizophrenia symptoms? Stress.
Then I guess you want to add on the stress of having a nuclear family if we are aiming for “normal.” A woman who has schizophrenia can have children, but there will definitely be added dimensions to any pregnancy, because she’d need to either go off all medications or still be on meds which can be a risk too. But let’s just say the kids have already been born. As any parent can tell you, raising children is still stressful and expensive. People with schizophrenia are often not employed or are marginally employed. I would say that they often are discriminated against in employment although I don’t have numbers to back this up. So, they will likely have less money than “normal” peers unless they are wealthy through inheritance. But we were going with the regular job and regular kids and regular spouse and everything.
I guess the odds of a person with schizophrenia having a completely “normal”, average, uneventful life are slim. Most people without schizophrenia don’t have “normal” jobs and “normal” kids and “normal” marriages and “normal” everything, although there are some people who do. Having schizophrenia means you will likely have more stress and less money. At the same time, stress can trigger symptoms. “Normal” people have trouble finding compatible spouses, so you add the dimension of having a really stigmatized illness to that, and you’ll find that the dating pool drops significantly. “Normal” people sometimes have kids with special needs, so that could happen to a person with schizophrenia too.
So, I would say that the statistical odds of anyone having a “normal” life are low. The odds of someone with schizophrenia having a completely “normal” life are much lower. But there is a HUGE difference between “normal” and having a good and fulfilling life.
In society we tend to judge people as having achieved a good life if they have a good job, if they have a successful, “normal” family life. But there are many many other ways to have a good life. I would say that “normal” shouldn’t even be the goalpost. “Normal” is like the mean number when you are measuring something. Sometimes even if you measure something and there is a mean number there might actually be no data that hits exactly on the mean number. Normal is like this. Sometimes people hit the mean, but a lot of times they don’t, so “normal” is just this idea we have out there about what is “normal” meanwhile no one is living a “normal” life.
So, TLDR (too long don’t read): Is it possible? Yes. Is it probable? Not really. Is it necessary? No.",schizophrenia
670,"Hi interesting and very valid question.
In my quite extensive experience I’ve come to believe two things
The number of people with a serious mental illness whose actions are driven by psychosis and/or seriously distorted beliefs and therefore have no logical control over their behavior..ARE VERY RARE.
The general perception that people with “mental illness” have no control over their actions and behaviors is almost completely universal in virtually every setting outside of psychiatry.
But yes in every instance, having any form of mental illness is never an active choice.
But in most cases the actions of an individual, whether or not they have a mental illness are driven by their own individual choices. The fact that people make poor choices, or will sometimes say “my illness made me do this” should rarely be allowed to apply .
Someone with a severe mental illness would usually have no concept that they are mentally ill, will rarely accept it, and would therefore never ever use it as a rationale for any of their behavior. What they will usually have is a totally valid rationale based on delusions, hallucinations etc, and those are almost always very easy to determine by any mental health professional, and actually pretty much anyone.
This is part of the reason why people with a serious mental illness rarely falls through the cracks within society. They simply stand out in contrast to the (relatively) normal behaviors and beliefs of people around them.
So when someone tells you that you have to accept their behavior in whatever form because they’re mentally ill.
The chances are that you shouldn’t.
And bear in mind that as adults we learn to modify our behaviors to relate to the world around us, and society provides plenty of models and feedback to enable us to do this.
There are always choices. Our behavior is one of them",schizophrenia
671,"Yes. I support and work with people almost everyday with people who have the diagnosis of Schizophrenia. I see everyday, the people that I support engaging in self talk, and responding to things that I and others do not see.
Often, they aren’t too bothered by their hallucinations, some actually are nearly always chatting like friends do when catching up, laughing etc.
But on the flip side, I have seen first hand someone use a razor to cut their throat because they couldn’t cope with their voices. I’ve also seen someone talk in many different voices, because she has so many voices that she engages with.
Medication can help, it never takes away the hallucinations completely. It does however keep them out of hospital, for the most part. Sometimes, they will need to go back to hospital for a medication review, or to be treated by medical professionals.
So yes, Schizophrenia is definitely an illness",schizophrenia
672,"I'm inclined to say no on this one.
Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness and is considered a psychotic disorder. However, drug induced psychosis can mimic symptoms of schizophrenia for example, but may be short lived.
Schizophrenia is a lifelong mental disorder that has no known cure. I have heard accounts of drug induced psychosis which have led to schizophrenia. But in all actuality, I think schizophrenia was always present laying dormant within the mind so to speak.
Drugs may have just exacerbated the illness, like throwing gas on a fire, exploding symptoms astronomically, making them surface and become apparent.
Regardless, drug induced psychosis is also considered a mental illness (substance use disorder). I think hereditary plays a major role. I have also heard that major stressful events can play factors as well.
I think that you are born with schizophrenia, but it may just take some time to surface and become present. These are just my personal opinions. There is no definite answer, as to what originates the disease…doctors to this day are still trying to figure out the root causes of this terrible illness.
As far as the origins of mine, I meet all three of these possible criteria mentioned.
My biological mother is schizoaffective like myself. Mental illness runs in the family. We have bipolars, borderlines, depression, anxiety, schizophrenics, some I suspect to be psychopaths, alcoholics, drug addicts…you name it, they appear somewhere down the bloodline…even one that was undiagnosed with obvious afflictions of the mind whom died in prison for cold blooded murder. A skeleton in the closet we do not speak of.
But, whatever…mental illness plagues the family. Always has, and probably always will. I am glad I have never reproduced, and don't think the world needs anymore little Zach's running around lol! The mold was broke when they made me, leave it broken, is probably for the best.
My mother is a drug addict and alcoholic…as am I. I am clean and sober over 18 months now. I don't really like sobriety, and I think it pretty much fucking sucks, but I have been staying firm on my path to recovery one day at a time. I don't say I'll never do drugs again, but I choose not to today.
Stress: I think my last severe psychotic break was initiated by extreme stress, and this exploded my symptoms, kicking things into full gear so to speak.
I had 5 deaths in the immediate family back-to-back that all died in various ways, COVID had just happened and was in full swing, my 12 year old cat that was like a son to me died a horrible death in my arms as I watched him take his last breath. Got fired from my job because I about attacked a coworker that disrespected me. Decided to leave work before I possibly killed him, and remove myself from the situation before things escalated anymore…I can be very dangerous…pointed out for attendance and was terminated. Debt collectors harassing me non-stop. Flat-ass broke on the verge of loosing everything. Dude living with me rent-free, that was supposedly my best friend at the time, betrayed me on several unforgivable counts, whom I flew into an intense psychotic rage upon. He locked himself in a room of my house…I kicked the door in and discovered he had jumped out the bedroom window to escape me. This enraged me even more…he made the right choice luckily though, because I do believe I would have destroyed him without mercy.
Full-blown manic for four months straight, stressed out and doing all the drugs I could get my hands on. A total damn mess. Fourth month psychosis reared it's ugly head. I simply didn't give a fuck anymore. Hallucinating and delusional…self-isolating…smoking ungodly amounts of methamphetamine.
At first, my family didn't know what the hell to do with me, as my brain was cooking itself. My dad finally intervened, and I was sent off to the loony bin to be stabilized, then shipped off directly to rehab. I haven't been the same since. I am now fully disabled and on Social Security.
I was considered bipolar for many, many years…rapid cycler w/occasionally mild psychotic features, but after all this shit, my schizophrenic symptoms grew exponentially and are now quite severe.
But anyways, I am making this answer rather lengthy.
I think schizophrenia has always been present within me. Granted my drug use and stress didn't help matters. I actually was rather hard on myself for quite some time, due to my past drug use, thinking I screwed myself up beyond repair. My psychiatrist made me feel a little better about this once, saying that my current mental disorders would of happened anyways at some point in time, one way or the other…was inevitable.
In conclusion, I don't think a person can have schizophrenia that is not caused by a mental disorder. However, I think things can make it worse in severity. Is it hereditary? Was it the drugs? The stress? Who really knows? What came first, the chicken or the egg? Regardless, it is here now, and I will have to live with it for the rest of my life…that is one thing I know for a fact.
I will share this pic…was the night before I was finally hospitalized. Completely out of my fucking mind. No grasp on reality whatsoever. Full-blown manic, fucked up on meth, and very, very psychotic…quite dangerous, no impulse control, very unstable and unpredictable. Not one of my finer moments in life. Hell, my eyes are green, but in the pic they are so glazed over that they appear a different color.
At emergency room, cop was cool and let me smoke one last cigarette after I begged him, before I was transported to psych ward. Had me in handcuffs, in case I tried to run away. Couple weeks into rehab, I went full-blown maniac again and was hospitalized yet again…haha that time four cops surrounded me on all sides brushing up against me in a tight circle as they escorted me into the ambulance and was restrained…good times 👍😬😔😱🤪👹😇😜…at psych ward again awhile back in July, but actually voluntarily admitted myself on that go round.",schizophrenia

674,"You're not even close. Mental illness is indeed an illness. Not all mental illness is like a trip. Not all mental illness is like a good trip. Mental illness is losing control of who you are, your feelings, your identity. Mental illness makes you unstable in your own choices and actions regardless of what you may want.
Depression is like sinking in the pits of despair without being able to pull yourself back up. Bipolar (and BPD) is like riding a roller coaster, but instead of being on a train you're in your own head, and your moods give you a run for your money. Mania makes you lose control, stop caring about consequences when life is all about consequences. Schizophrenia seems like having a demon (or more) stuck in your brain telling you that you're a horrible person. OCD takes control of you and makes you perform rituals that you know are silly but you do not have the power to control.
I'm not going to continue. The prevailing theme is lack of control, lack of power over who you actually want to be and what your illness makes you become. People with mental illness have to fight each day just to fit in, just to function. Sometimes just to resist the temptation of killing themselves.
It is a real illness, it's not just in their heads, or rather it's physically in their heads. It's in their brains. But it's real, and it's physical. Your good trip is probably like hypomania, and that is just one of the minor symptoms of mental illness, amongst many more debilitating ones.",schizophrenia

If I notice my usage is increasing, I stop for a period of time. I have never had drug related Psychosis because I don't do hard drugs and don't use MJ when manic.
If you are bipolar of schizophrenic, please discuss with your doctor.

676,"There is no medical or psychiatric consensus on the relationship cannabis has with psychosis, and evidence seems to point in numerous directions. The most agreed upon answer, and one I’ve come to agree with after reading every study and review I’ve been able to find on this subject, is that cannabis has a very low chance of worsening psychosis symptoms in people who already have psychosis, but there is no proven link between cannabis directly causing psychosis to develop on its own.
To be as clear as possible; if you already have psychosis, there is a chance cannabis can make your symptoms worse. If you do not have psychosis, there is no evidence that cannabis can cause psychosis to suddenly develop.
Cannabis-Induced Psychosis, or CIP, is a form of psychosis purportedly directly caused by cannabis; its confirmation as an existing disorder in of itself is heavily debated as well, and the psychology world seems split on whether to recognize it as a legitimate disorder or not. The term first appeared in 1987 after a Swedish research team determined that early cannabis consumers were more likely to develop psychosis later in their lives, going off of self-reported data. Research into cannabis’ relationship to psychosis skyrocketed, and in a few years, it became the most funded part of cannabis research as a whole. Unfortunately, many of these studies relied on poor data collection methods, such as cold-call surveys and singular cases, as well as poor control factors, as very, very few took environmental, social or prior psychological factors into account. This trend continued into the 2010s, when studies conducted by Benford, 2011, Every-Palmer, 2010, Muller, 2010, Van Der Veer, 2011 and Hurst, 2011 all counted temporary anxiety, disorganization, paranoia, agitation, confusion, tachycardia or an increased heart rate, and hypokalemia or low potassium levels, as psychosis symptoms. Many psychologists, doctors and therapists disagreed with this notion, as these symptoms are neither severe nor do they last more than a few hours after consumption, at most. They are very common and do not cause psychosis, yet these studies seem to affirm that they can.
Evidence against a connection between cannabis and psychosis is rather prominent in the psychiatry and cannabis worlds as well. In 2015, Matthew Hill of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary said there is little evidence of a causal relationship between cannabis and psychosis, and went further to say there is evidence that cannabis use does not cause psychosis. His conclusion was similar to many others; cannabis can induce psychosis in individuals sooner by worsening their pre-existing psychosis. Dr. Romina Mizrahi, the director of the Focus on Youth Psychosis Prevention Clinic at The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto agreed that cannabis does not cause psychosis in individuals who do not already have psychosis, but could trigger an underlying condition. Other experts speculate that reverse causality may play a role in so many studies’ false positives, believing cannabis use to be a byproduct of mental illness, not the cause; those with psychotic episodes use cannabis to self-medicate before their diagnosis. Furthermore, and even more drastically contradictory to CIP, CBD has been clinically shown to be an active treater of schizophrenia, a form of psychosis, and was demonstrated to be as effective as amisulpride, a standard antipsychotic.

678,"It is really hard to tell for real, for many reasons, such as:
We don't really know the etiology of schizophrenia.
First: it is hard to link anything with schizophrenia for sure, as it is for many others psychiatric disorders. Genetics, environment, parenting, psychology... All that may be related.
For example, we know it is highly probable that genetic factors are involved, but we don't know exactly how many and which genes are involved (it seems to be many), if and how they interact with each other, and how big its influence is in the development of schizophrenia.
We know that the monozygotic twin (genetically identical) of a schizophrenic patient has a 50% chance of also developing schizophrenia, while a dizygotic twin would have 12%, and the risk in general population is 1%. This tells us genetics is an important but not absolute risk factor for the disorder. [1]
Another example: it's been already thought that schizophrenia is somehow related to complications at the moment of birth [1, 2], such as caesarean section etc. It's also something not clear yet, but it shows how intricated the etiology of that disease may be.
It is hard to scientifically study marijuana.
Even though the politics around cannabis have been changing dramatically on the last years, we still don't have so many serious studies about marijuana, because... Well, because it was (it is yet, in most countries) illegal, of course.
Then, it sums up with the difficulty to study schizophrenia, and the result is that the relation between both is not so clear.
So, why would cannabis be somehow related to schizophrenia?
It is true that smoking cannabis can lead to psychotic-like experiences. I've been through some myself. That's what we popularly call bad trip. I've also experienced something that I had never heard of before it happened to me, which are psychotic-like experiences that occur after a period of marijuana abuse, when you're not high anymore. I felt I was starting to go crazy (something like the prodromic symptoms of schizophrenia). It is also something reported, by the way. [3]
Facts like those above may intuitively suggest a relation between cannabis and psychosis, e.g. schizophrenia. Other acute and chronic effects of cannabis abuse which are similar to schizophrenia symptoms include paranoid delusions and fragmented thinking (positive symptoms), alterated perception of time and amotivation and anhedonia (negative symptoms) etc. [3]
But we cannot say marijuana abuse is a risk factor for schizophrenia just because its intoxication produces schizophrenia-like experiences. In fact, most people don't experience these symptoms when high. The presence or absence of such experiences may be related to the personality and even genetics of the individual (just like schizophrenia is). [3]
Look at this: [3]
Several recent large studies suggest that, over long-term (~8 year) follow up,~50% of patients without any pre-existing psychiatric disorder who were hospitalized for cannabis-induced psychosis, were later re-diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder.
Maybe that's because cannabis leads to schizophrenia. Maybe that's just because people who experience psychotic-like symptoms are more likely to develop schizophrenia due to factors not related with cannabis itself. Maybe that's because some people, with certain backgrounds, have increased chances of developing schizophrenia once they smoke pot and experience psychotic-like symptoms. We can't really tell.
Finally answering the question itself:
Cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of psychotic symptoms and persistent use increased this risk further. Importantly, this study yields evidence for a unidirectional relationship between cannabis use and psychosis.
The cumulative evidence for the association between cannabis and psychosis have been examined in five systematic reviews, four of which found a consistent association between cannabis use and psychosis.
In the general population, the strength of association between any cannabis exposure and the development of psychosis is modest.
Exposure to cannabinoids in adolescence confers a higher risk for psychosis outcomes in later life and the risk is dose-related.
All this information comes from the reference number 3 of my answer. We can summarize that:
Cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia, but it seems not to have an important effect on the general population. Most people who smoke pot do not develop psychosis.
On the other side, the use of cannabis during adolescence may be an important factor for the later development of schizophrenia, especially for those with family history of psychosis, or history of child abuse, or other risk factors for psychosis.
Apparentely, smoking pot does not have anti-psychotic effects (even though CBD seems to have).

679,"Hi,
I do not think that there is a causal relationship between schizophrenia and smoking weed!
However, there are people that have a predisposition to developing schizophrenia and smoking weed may be the trigger to the prodromal phase of schizophrenia.
That is, people with a predisposition to a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia would developed the disorder even if they had not smoked weed! Other triggers for this group of people include stress, trauma, loss, chemical exposure and so on.
How do I know this? Well many people smoke cannabis for years or decades and do not develop schizophrenia. Not everyone that smokes weed becomes schizophrenic!
So at some stage people that have a predisposition to developing schizophrenia, we're going to develop the disorder between the ages of 24–38.
I mention the age range, because most people seem to develop the disorder between the ages mentioned above. If you get to your forties, your very unlikely to develop schizophrenia.
Relationship between psychosis and drug abuse or use
People with schizophrenia that abuse drugs (including weed) are more likely to experience more intense and frequent psychotic symptoms as well as lability of mood.
Research has shown that people who have experienced psychosis (schizophrenia or otherwise) are likely to exacerbate psychotic symptoms if they smoke weed and take other drugs, including many types of prescription drugs, particularly particularly psychoactive drugs.

680,"Weed cannot cause anyone to develop a psychological disorder. Anybody claiming that smoking weed will make you go insane or have hallucinations, is misinterpretating whatever study they’ve read.
People who smoke weed are more likely to have certain disorders, because people who feel depressed (mood disorders) or anxious (anxiety disorders) or like their mind is always racing (ADHD) will try to find things that help them feel better. Everyone I know who smokes and happens to have a disorder says that they smoke BECAUSE of their symptoms. Or that the two aren't related in any way, and they'd smoke weed whether or not they had the disorder, and they'd have had the disorder whether or not they smoked.
It's not that cannabis makes people depressed, anxious, bipolar, or schizophrenic. It's that people with disorders are more likely to want to smoke. Correlation versus causation.",schizophrenia

So if you have a history of mental illness and/or psychosis in your family, you might want to be careful, otherwise, your chances of developing psychosis from smoking marijuana are pretty slim.",schizophrenia
682,"There is no medical or psychiatric consensus on the relationship cannabis has with psychosis, and evidence seems to point in numerous directions. The most agreed upon answer, and one I’ve come to agree with after reading every study and review I’ve been able to find on this subject, is that cannabis has a very low chance of worsening psychosis symptoms in people who already have psychosis, but there is no proven link between cannabis directly causing psychosis to develop on its own.
To be as clear as possible; if you already have psychosis, there is a chance cannabis can make your symptoms worse. If you do not have psychosis, there is no evidence that cannabis can cause psychosis to suddenly develop.
Cannabis-Induced Psychosis, or CIP, is a form of psychosis purportedly directly caused by cannabis; its confirmation as an existing disorder in of itself is heavily debated as well, and the psychology world seems split on whether to recognize it as a legitimate disorder or not. The term first appeared in 1987 after a Swedish research team determined that early cannabis consumers were more likely to develop psychosis later in their lives, going off of self-reported data. Research into cannabis’ relationship to psychosis skyrocketed, and in a few years, it became the most funded part of cannabis research as a whole. Unfortunately, many of these studies relied on poor data collection methods, such as cold-call surveys and singular cases, as well as poor control factors, as very, very few took environmental, social or prior psychological factors into account. This trend continued into the 2010s, when studies conducted by Benford, 2011, Every-Palmer, 2010, Muller, 2010, Van Der Veer, 2011 and Hurst, 2011 all counted temporary anxiety, disorganization, paranoia, agitation, confusion, tachycardia or an increased heart rate, and hypokalemia or low potassium levels, as psychosis symptoms. Many psychologists, doctors and therapists disagreed with this notion, as these symptoms are neither severe nor do they last more than a few hours after consumption, at most. They are very common and do not cause psychosis, yet these studies seem to affirm that they can.

Mark Phillips, a personal injury lawyer from Ontario, attacked a family of immigrants in a parking lot mall because they were speaking Spanish, accusing them of being terrorists and members of ISIS. He crushed one of their ribs with a baseball bat. He plead guilty to assault, but claimed he was suffering from CIP. He was granted a conditional discharge.

Here is the big butt…
First time users who smoke too much might feel effects like schizophrenia (voices in your head) among many other horrible sensations. If you are not used to marijuana you can OD (overdose) and have a very frightening experience akin to a panic attack.
You will be fine by the way, you won't die. Take deep breaths and walk it off.
If you are new to weed, take baby steps. Smoke small amounts and wait 20 min after each small hit. Panic attacks are not fun!
Once your body is accustomed to weed, it is like drinking 2 beers. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not a strong drug.

685,"No. This is a lie.
As one doctor from England said, “If marijuana caused schizophrenia, there’d be a lot more schizophrenics.”
That’s funny, considering that the majority of people have used marijuana recreationally. He’s absolutely right, there wouldn’t be a sane person left. However, perhaps there never were any sane people. We did let them make marijuana illegal without considering that it was cruel and inhumane.
When marijuana was made illegal it was made illegal because of racism. It was said that it would cause interracial sex and make black people think they were as good as the white man.
When racism began to be less popular, they changed this narrative to a health based one. However, they have no argument, as all of their health claims are false about marijuana.
In fact, the American Medical Association originally protested the ban against marijuana. It was being prescribed for a variety of things in America, including epilepsy. For epilepsy, marijuana has been known to be an anticonvulsant for hundreds of years. It was used on babies, children, and adults.
They only stopped prescribing marijuana for epilepsy because of prohibition. Marijuana wasn’t found out to be dangerous.
However, they still make up lies against it. This is one lie, that it causes schizophrenia.
This is very insensitive to people who actually have schizophrenia. I’m glad I don’t have it. But I know their problem, like my epilepsy, is not understood or managed very well.
We shouldn’t let politicians be doctors for us. They want to lock people in jail for no reason. They don’t care about the health of this nation. If they did, not just marijuana, but all drugs would be legal.",schizophrenia
686,"Yes. In my experience during my depression worsening I felt weed caused my psychotic episode where life and reality just seemed mad, I was having thoughts for the sake of having thoughts, any thoughts, for fear of not thinking or fear of something irrational happening if I didn't think in a certain way to counter how the weed was making me feel but I couldn't stop,
When I had psychotic episodes and drastic derealization I knew this because I was getting worse and becoming hopeless making myself worse each day expecting to do the same thing everyday because I couldn't go out feeling the way I did because I could to trust my thoughts to say or do the right thing in my mind which was be on cue and paying attention, felt I got scared I couldn't tell the difference between concentrating and not concentrating, just believing whatever came to mind because I couldn't explain why I felt the way I did.
I had them few and far between but to this day I'm affected by it I suffer with it so badly I don't trust myself to be telling my counsellor the right thing I constantly rapidly filter my thoughts before speaking even to a professional but I had somewhat of problems and have smoked since I was 13–14 in a place it was widely available.
if you're having psychotic episodes or are worried about how you feel take it from me it's worth staying away from weed and giving it up completely at this stage even when it seems most frightening because I feel I just got worse because I used it as a crutch and a way of managing feelings/emotion, it is just a distraction for some people, the labels you give it can drastically alter your personal problems with it by that I mean what you think when you think about, your use, how much you rely on, how much you obsess over, how much you think it helps you (be yourself or complete you), when you abuse/get greedy (do you feel anything rly tht neg when you should for overdoing it?), u can attract a lot of false responses that are easier to come up with that can be very unhelpful when thinking or asking yourself about anything like such.
if you can relate I might be able to offer experiences or advice on what I did when I was where I was at not a professional so don't base your life on it only take what makes sense to you after all this was my tailored experience minus the long part.

Note that cannabis supporters tend to dismiss these studies claiming that other studies have shown that this is only true with persons who have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia.

688,"There is a correlation between smoking weed and experiencing psychotic symptoms, according to some research. However, as you probably know, correlation and causation are not the same thing.
It may be that weed triggers psychosis in some people who are susceptible. Or that some people with psychosis are drawn to smoke weed in order to manage their symptoms. It could be that certain age or cultural or ethnic groups are more prone to suffer psychosis and are also but unrelatedly more likely to smoke weed. For example there are higher rates of diagnosed schizophrenia among black Caribbean people and weed plays a part in the culture of a subset of black Caribbean people, so there may be a correlation that is nothing to do with causation there. There are also gazillions of weed smokers who do not develop psychotic symptoms and many many people with psychotic symptoms who never smoke weed.
So, long story short, it's unlikely that weed smoking causes psychosis in a simple a therefore b way but there is a correlation which would benefit from further exploration.",schizophrenia
689,"The relationship between schizophrenia and pot is pretty strong-- but not for the reason you'd think. I've worked in psych units for over thirty years, BTW, so my answer comes from firsthand experience and direct contact, not academia. People afflicted with schizophrenia, those who use cannabis, smoke a lot of cannabis. It's a preferred drug of choice for self-medication among schizophrenics. It does poorly in regard to alleviating the symptoms, and often exacerbates them. This is not an uncommon parallel to those suffering from depression turning to alcohol- a depressant— for relief. Vicious cycle. There are those that claim cannabis can trigger schizophrenia. I find that a rather large pill to swallow. Studies supporting this claim are largely based on case histories. Case histories are inextricably grounded in Subject timelines-- when did symptoms first become evident, and what other behaviors were being exhibited at that time?— and interviews of the Subject and those around them, family, friends, teachers, etc. The problem with this is that the effects of schizophrenia and experimenting with intoxicants tend to occur at the same stage in life,mid to late adolescence. A kid smokes a joint, and a week later is telling his mom the dog has been spying on him for the FBI. He's never said such things before.
“My boy is healthy as a horse. Nobody else in the family has suspected the Feds have used a pet for snooping. There's no history of mental illness"" (that anybody's ever talked about-- (my interjection)) “in the family. It has to be the marijuana. “

692,"Not necessarily, but it can. If you have a genetic disposition for it, yes. Smoking and drug use of any kind greatly increases the risk.
Now since I believe that the cause of schizophrenia is almost always spiritual, I will say it in spiritual terms. Schizophrenia is a description of the symptoms caused by demonic spirits. Smoking and drug use open doors or give demonic spirits legal rights to torment you. A genetic disposition is the spiritual equivalent of a hereditary curse. People with heretary curses are more likely to develop the condition.

699,"How real the voices sound.
When you read about “hearing voices” or having “auditory hallucinations”, the phrases kind of carry this meaning of “not real”. So you probably often think that if you ever “hallucinated a voice” you’d obviously know it wasn’t real.
The voices will shock you with their strange sentience and ability to come from outside your window or from passing cars etc. It’s the #1 reason why I believe it’s so hard to “have insight” about your condition as a schizophrenic. Because every waking moment you have these voices that are trying to prove to you with all their might that they are these omnipotent beings with powers you couldn’t possibly understand.
They will mimic your friends or family members and make it sound like the people who you loved and trusted actually hate you. As you walk past your brother in the hallway you’ll hear a voice (that sounds exactly like your brother and comes from the direction of his body) say “Fuck you asshole!”
I went to the funeral of my aunt and all I could hear was my family members telling me over and over again to “Go to hell” as I sat and stared between the cracks of the coffin and its lid to try and see if my aunt was really inside or if this was all some elaborately staged hoax.
It’s why when you first start hearing voices you suspect your neighbors and anyone around you. The voices can come from the wall that separates your room from your neighbor’s and it actually sounds like someone from the neighbor’s house is talking through the wall to you.
They don’t just repeat random things either (although they can and do do that as well), they can respond to things you say out loud or things you think about. I had an Apple Watch for several years, and whenever I would say to the watch “Hey Siri!” the voices would respond (coming from the watch) “Hey asshole!”
Last night as I finished blow drying my hair they said “Thank you for blow drying your hair” in a weirdly sarcastic tone.
Never in a million years would I have suspected a schizophrenia diagnosis. The only reason I even got one was because I had already been seeing a psych for depression and she got to sort of watch it unfold.",schizophrenia
700,"The psychosis is not always constant. There are good days and bad days. Some days it’s not there at all. Other times it can be triggered by stress
It makes feeling and expressing emotions very hard. Sometimes I will be very sad and want to cry but I can’t muster tears. You feel apathetic, bored, and empty a lot
You can have insight and still be affected. I know the things I see aren’t real but they still freak me out.
It almost always coexists with depression, specifically in the form of lack of motivation and enthusiasm.
It often comes with social anxiety. It warps your perception so that if someone is standing next to you it actually looks like they’re glaring at you, even if they’re facing away from you
Sometimes it makes it difficult to speak or find your words. I’m usually well spoken but sometimes it makes me feel as if I’ve lost half my vocabulary. Thoughts will sometimes disappear half way through. It happens when writing or texting too, sometimes I will begin to just type or write jibberish.
It impairs you cognitively and can make you more clumsy
Delusions and senses of paranoia can be debilitating, even if you know they are unrealistic. It’s like a compulsion to give in and try and do things to prevent certain outcomes or save yourself.
You have to be mindful of the type of media and news you consume. News about world decline, A.I, ect can exacerbate paranoia
It makes your dreams very vivid and lucid (and actually very interesting)
Substance use as well as an over-reliance on caffeine and nicotine is very common
The list goes on but those are the ones coming to mind mostly.",schizophrenia
701,"For me it's not so bad. I'm medicated, a year and a bit sober and very proud of myself.
I thought my life was over, it wasn't.
I can't make friends and relationships are hard for me but that's okay. I have a really lovely partner now who treats me well, reminds me to stay medicated, holds me when I cry or I want to cry but cannot physically squeeze tears out, holds me when I tell him how scared I am for my future. He reassures me that he will always be with me. So many have though. So who knows.
The social paranoia remains.
The depression never goes away.
The fear of having an episode plagues me every single day — what if the meds fail me, I worry until it's obsessive.
The only thing is I feel sad that I contributed to giving myself this disease. I always had symptoms of having schizoaffective disorder but using ice for a significant period of time really exaggerated these symptoms until they were reserved less for my manic episodes and happened every single day day, continuing as I got sober. That was scary. That weird shit was happening to me, and it really fucking happened as far as I'm concerned, but I wasn't on anything, I wasn't too sleep deprived. My brain just broke.
Be careful with your brain folks. All in all though I'm okay with my life. I don't tell too many people coz of the stigma but I know people close to me know and are relieved I got help and see a therapist etc to help myself and them too.",schizophrenia
702,"[the guy who made those pictures, Louis Wain was a schizophrenic… They aren’t bad, are they?]
My mom, who is a phisician (although neither schizophrenic nor psychiatrician) told me several thngs about it
Most of schizophrenic people actually function quite normally so long as they take their medicines. If they do not take the medicines things can go… much worse. Still most of those people are unlikely to harm you. And if on their medicines they are pretty reliable. Maybe not to be bestowed the most reponsible tasks ever (like you see managing nuclear reactors or intense care of stillborns), but certainly not a lunatic.
They usually have either visual or sonic hallucinations but only rarely both at the same time.
You shall avoid any ambiguity while talking to them, as they can interprete any ambiguous speech in an unpredictible manner. As Our Lord told:
37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. (Mt 5)
If your speech and writing is clear, precise, they are much less likely to suffer some delusions concerning your intentions.
The most important thing is that a schizophrenics given a proper treatment usually can have satisfactory lives and make others’ lives better*. Most of them aren NOT deranged maniacs who want to hurt you because some voices in their heads told them to do so.
*I do not like a phrase “contribute to the society”. It is so collectivist! It sounds like taken from a mouth of Stalin or Hitler![1]. People are invidual beings and each one of us puts slightly different value on certain things. That’s how we are beautiful. If everyone was identical our society would have looked like more like a totalitarian anthill than a commonwealth of reasonable beings…
[1] BTW nazi Germany started exterminating mentally (and phisically) ill people way before Jews. “For the common good”. While putting the deluded drug-addict (Hitler) in charge of the nation. Never trust the people who tell lots about the good of the society while hurting the innocent individuals around them. They are the true madmen.",schizophrenia
703,"For me, it is how real the voices really sound. I myself took about like 10 years or so to get a diagnosis.
Back in about 2005 or so, I would walk around in stores and hear people insult me and generally put me down. I honestly believed that people just liked to be nasty to me. I lived like this till about 2015. Then I quit my job and had a really rough year. This is when the symptoms started really flaring up. I would just sit there and state off into space for an hour or so at a time, it would literally only feel like minutes to me.
Then the real bad voices started, I was living with my family at the time and would always hear them say nasty stuff about me. I could not take it anymore so I basically ran away.
I ended up going down south to restart my life and that is where the problems really picked up. I was working 70 hours a week and was really burnt out.
The voices then increased, I started having panic attacks and then after 4 hospital visit I got put on a lockdown ward. It was a very traumatic experience.
Once back home, the voices still follow me around. Anytime I am near my old work, I hear my boss talking about me. Anytime I go to a specific theater I hear an old friend talking about me. In public I still hear people dissing me. It is very draining to deal with this on a daily basis.",schizophrenia
704,"You keep having break downs, emotionally falling apart, that sort of thing. Then, over a long time you kinda get used to them, sounds absurd, how can you get used to that sort of thing, but I have found that I have.
In some sort of way, you learn to fail and how to fail better.
In my initial breakdowns I would lose everything, relationships, jobs etc. All routine would collapse apart from chain smoking. Now, not so much. I now know how to work through the crap in my head, keep my behaviour vaguely normal and so on.
It’s got to the point where I have turned to my friends and said, ‘I think I had a little bit of a breakdown there. Didn’t realise it at the time.’
And they go, ‘Yeah, didn’t want to say anything but you did seem a bit off.’
Ah, well, life goes on.",schizophrenia
705,"I don't think I could muster as good of an answer as the one prior but I can tell you this; schizophrenia isn't one of those illnesses where you have the ability to self diagnose . For many, it doesn't start off as completely unbearable but it does become worse if you don't or refuse to seek treatment. It's something that occurs rather gradually and your symptoms can mimic other illnesses and those are the ones that lead you into a mental evaluation (excuse the run-on). In many of my answers regarding the subject, one of the first symptoms I had was depression. I didn't immediately starting “hearing voices” until two years later! And the thing is I don't know if it was all connected or not.
Now, that's out of the way...
I have three major illness; Schizophrenia, Bipolar I and Borderline Personality Disorder. Mental health runs in my family and at this time, my father, his sister(my aunt) and her son have been diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Bipolar I and Depression. Boo-hoo for me.
When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, I had trouble understanding what the hell it was. No one sat down and gave me an explanation. Instead, I was placed in a psychiatrist home and they feed me pills. I developed an eating disorder soon after because I believed they were trying to kill me. Fortunately, the pills helped(surprising enough) and was able to go home.
I wasn't prepared for that.
I had attacks, the voices were as if I was in a crowded room. I thought my head would explode! No one told me the toll it would take on body. And no one told me how disabling it can be.
Amongst all those things, I still feel depressed, I still go through my various moodlets and behaviors. No one tells you how bad it is and no one tells you how little the pills work and the side effects that come with it.",schizophrenia
706,"Word Salad
People talk alot about the psychosis aspect but something no one ever told me about is “word salad.” The jumbled word/speech pattern or lack there of in schizophrenics isn't as publicized so for me personally it was something I'd lived with that I thought was “normal” but have come to realize it's not and it drives people crazy. Not the actual schizophrenic, but the people around them. I first REALLY started noticing when I left my ex husband of 7 yrs and got a new boyfriend. I'd be talking to him telling him a story and at a certain point he'd be like
“OK, wtf, I don't even know what you're talking about anymore!”
And I'd be like duhh, “Well if u had listened…!” Because to me everything I had just said made sense so I thought he was just being a lazy guy.
So this happened a lot. Like 1 to 5 times DAILY. So once again I was frustrated but I could tell he was equally frustrated and Everytime he'd say more or less the same thing.
“I am listening!! But you've told like 5 or 6 different stories that I don't even remember what you were originally talking about, but now you're talking about this!”
Once again I was like duhh it's pretty simple if you'd listen! But after so much of this I could tell he truly was listening and I started trying to listen to my self perceived obvious story structure and it didn't take long for me to realize he was right. I'd start talking about one specific event or story and fast-forward some manic 30 mins later of straight talking and I realized my version of a cut & dry simple story was more like a sped up rollercoaster of connect the dots from bits of this and pieces of that & then something else all together. It's like id go on a tangent over some detail then go on another tangent to explain said tangent only to add additional info from the past that I deemed crucially relevant and then…
*BAM* he'd stop me mid sentence. Confused, overwhelmed, frustrated, and annoyed he couldn't keep up.
This would leave me also feeling confused, overwhelmed, frustrated, and annoyed.
**In the spirit of trying to keep this short and on topic**
These instances with that specific boyfriend were what made me realize I had a problem. I know that sounds extreme but it was it was a serious problem. I was only with him 4 months and since him it's been countless others who I've opened up to and who've gotten frustrated and said more or less word for word what he said. Made me realize it's exactly what my mom says too. The realization that EVERYONE is overwhelmed, confused, and frustrated with me when I talk really cemented the idea in my head that I must have a problem. All these different people with different motives, relationships, thoughts with me ALL OF THEM can't follow my “stories”
This was crushing. It still is. I love talking but unfortunately I now understand that what I perceive to be normal communication is one of my grandest delusions of all and EVERYONE knew it but me.",schizophrenia
707,"There are 3 kinds of Schizophrenia in our psyche of the 12 kinds of mental disorders. You sound like a Hebephrenic. Just my gut feeling on that. I may be wrong. Your tendency towards Paranoid Schizophrenia is possible because you continuously described a sense of threat by those people around you.
Nevertheless, “the big secret which no one wants to tell us about Schizophrenia is”… that these “voices” one hears are actually sourced in the psyche and expressed by one of the seven Freudian Archetypes. It is an archetype which has the power to take over, psychologically. That Archetype also has the ability to either encourage behaviors or actually institute them.
The very idea that Fear was the stimulus you were experiencing suggests this whole condition appeared because of some fear generating event in your early life. Example would be like divorce between your parents, perhaps. Fear itself produced an opportunity for this Freudian Archetype to take over.
The big “secret” is that psychologist need to identify that archetype! Psychologists need you very much to work with their researchers when this voice you hear, or each of all the many voices you may well be hearing, speak to you.
Who is that Voice, because the Archetype is a very old psychic element inside of us all. What does this element do or might plan to do as a response, besides talk to you consciously? It it the Libido? Perhaps the Id. We don’t know because psychologists have long ignored this secret, about just who this voice is and what are the voices powers and thinking patterns. Because that voice is actually dominant under the circumstances of the experience, and we have never even spoken to this voice.
Much can be learned by recognizing that this voice is part of your thinking apparatus. It will not go away. Who is it? How can outsiders understand who the voice is and speak directly to it?
This secret is not one we want to recognize because the very idea of Archetypes in Control seems insane to us all when Sanity means they do not appear to the Sane. We believe we want these voice(s) to go away. But the real secret is that you and all of us need to accept this psychic entity and work with it towards better mental health.",schizophrenia
708,"The sensory processing issues.
Unlike typical brains, ours has terrible sensory gating. This means our brain can’t tune out or eliminate insignificant sounds; everything is heard at once with basically no volume control. It makes it incredibly hard to concentrate when everything is so loud, and it almost feels like it’s “pulsing” in my ears. Sometimes I get headaches from it. Some sounds are just awful, and I start getting agitated being around the sound. Also makes it hard to hear people just talking at a normal volume. My brain can’t “drown out” another sound so the focus is on their voice. Everyone thought I had hearing problems when I was younger, but I could hear everything just too much.
Goes for visuals as well. Light sensitivity is a big one, and sometimes when too many things are happening at once it becomes rather overwhelming. Slow moving objects are hard to follow.
Another is the memory problems you get. Paired with difficulty following time, I usually have no idea when something happened relative to the present. Something I did a few days ago I could think happened months to years ago.
Something I said only moments ago I’ll have no idea even happened. I can’t remember things I need to do and I often forget I need to sleep and eat.",schizophrenia
709,"That you go into Schizophrenia unknowingly thinking that all of your life expectations would be fulfilled. That what the normal life has failed to provide, you possess some supernatural power and that power would sooner or later make a lot of your dreams come true. That being in this state continuously and not recovering from it, you would achieve what you always wanted to achieve. Even after you recover, the memories of hallucinations don’t go away. What you did in your schizophrenic years don’t go away. You have to constantly live with the fact that there was a breakdown in your reality, there was a breakdown in your normal life. And there was no continuity in your normal life. And this will remain the truth even while you have recovered and have been living a completely normal life. People often they there is a chance of relapse if the medications are stopped. Not even the Psychiatrist, not even the Doctors ask you about the emptiness that you feel. The emptiness that pushed you down into abnormal state doesn’t vanish like that when you recover and have a normal life. The emptiness still persists. And it’s upon you to accept that disconnect from your real life and that emptiness and keep yourself busy until that emptiness stops troubling you.",schizophrenia
710,"I never really heard voices. When I listen to music I hear the lyrics with many words changed with an intention to try to get a message across through targeted changes, with some degree of interactivity. I struggled with delusions a lot but to me the condition was evident because since the beginning I started feeling not off, but like every feeling was slightly different and I had such an acute onset that it was hard not to notice, and even my surroundings would feel strange, every aspect of my conscious experience was decidedly not normal though it would be hard to put into words what felt abnormal, to name one trees felt taller. My initial delusions were so absurd that in the moments I was less psychotic I would question myself and I initially also had a bout of very intrusive thoughts, like I couldn’t stop thinking on a flow for hours until I was having a mental breakdown cause I couldn’t even sleep, and usually I never even engage with my inner monologue, almost as though I have anauralia though I don’t.
I think what nobody tells you about schizophrenia is how much it drains your will to do especially with long term or uncertain prospects. It’s not like you feel bothered, or not like it, you feel like you want to do whatever you are thinking of but ultimately you don’t really give a shit in a very neutral way and so you wait and try to find the will to engage and the ability to enjoy and respond to everything that isn’t ultra-stimulating like the delusions. That’s very real but since it’s not a presence of something it’s hard to describe it, it’s like you lost engagement with what you could do, what you could do that’s not in your existing patterns or naturally developing isn’t happening because you feel no pressure either positive or negative to act, especially when you are over the positive symptoms which would otherwise keep you more on edge or excited, for lack of a better word.",schizophrenia
711,"There are several things:
As with any condition that is usually prescribed a neuroleptic for the long term to treat (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, psychotic depression, and TRD)is the potential shortening of a lifespan by anywhere between 5–15 years. This is not universal and as with everything in mental health it varies by individual. The cause of this lifespan shortening is the drugs’ association with obesity, and not the effects of the drugs themselves. which leads to:
Weight gain and weight loss are both side effects of the majority of psychiatric medication. For example I was on Geodon for almost 2 decades and I gained a ton of weight. I have a friend who was prescribed Abilify and he lost weight. Both are atypical neuroleptic medicines for bipolar mania (a type of psychosis) and both have weight gain and weight loss listed as side effects. As my psychiatrist explained to me before I went on it (And later what I figured out first hand being on this medication) is they seem to put a kind of disconnect between the nerves in your stomach, your brain, and the parts of your brain that determine hunger and if you are full or not. As an example about 2 hours after I would take my Geodon at night, which I took at dinner because you’re supposed to take Geodon with food, despite being full it would feel like I haven’t eaten all day. It took awhile to get control on that, similarly my friend was also to put a good amount of his lost weight back on.
Most people with the schizophrenia diagnosis can - and do - live somewhat normal and independent lives. Some better than others.
It has one of the better prognoses out of all the mental disorders. In fact the sooner one is treated - i.e. their first episode - they have a great chance at recovery and being able to manage the condition with the most amount of independence.
There are side effects for these types of medication. For example Geodon gave me akathisia. These side effects are not common at all however, and just because one medication gives you a side effect doesn’t mean that all of them will. Everyone’s body processes drugs differently and it’s best to be as open as possible with your psychiatrist about side effects you are having because you can easily switch neuroleptics and see if your body handles the new one better.
Finding the right drug combination can take time. As mentioned everyone tolerates drugs differently and it can take some time before you know if a medication is going to work or not. The most common - and biggest - mistake I see in new psychiatric patients is that people will take (lets take something that takes a very long time to even start showing changes) like an SSRI for a week or two, decide there’s no difference and just give up. In this example an SSRI can take 6–8 months before any change is noticed either internally or visibly from the outside. In addition with neuroleptics you typically need 2 weeks after symptoms cease or lessen to know if a particular medication is going to work.
This point isn’t for people who suspect they have it or do have it, this is for the family members, friends, and caretakers. Schizophrenia is typically very treatable - if they take their medication. There’s a good number of people who are homeless because of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Some diligence of the people involved in the patient’s support system have some responsibility to keep the patient safe, which might mean checking the medication and making sure it’s being taken - especially in the beginning.
Bottom line is it’s very treatable and your life isn’t over. Fact is there’s a high chance you can live your life with a very high degree of independence. If you are struggling try and reach out. If you don’t have a support system in place, then you might want to consider living in a halfway house as not only would that give you the support you need but you will also be around people who share your condition and who you could relate to for support also. I would suggest you find a community of people with the diagnosis regardless of your situation as it aways helps to talk to people who are going through what you are, group therapy is scary but it can be a very strong relief to hear stories of someone else going through struggles you yourself have gone through.
You’re not alone and you don’t need to be. That’s something all mentally ill people should know. There’s always hope.",schizophrenia
712,"The subjective experience of utter disintegration: fragmentation of the world, annihilation of the ego, undermining of “givenness”, pervasive jarring unreality, a place without respite. Nothing holds, everything anew yet lost…
Let the accounts speak for themselves:
… I realised the danger I was in. For me, madness was definitely not a condition of illness; I did not believe that I was ill. It was rather a country, opposed to Reality, where reigned an implacable light, blinding, leaving no place for shadow; an immense space without boundary, limitless, flat; a mineral, lunar country, cold as the wastes of the North Pole. In this stretching emptiness, all is unchangeable, immobile, congealed, crystallized. Objects are stage trappings, placed here and there, geometric cubes without meaning.
People turn weirdly about, they make gestures, movements without sense; they are phantoms whirling on an infinite plain, crushed by the pitiless electric light. And I — I am lost in it, isolated, cold, stripped, purposeless under the light. A wall of brass separates me from everybody and everything. In the midst of desolation, in indescribable distress, in absolute solitude, I am terrifyingly alone; no one comes to help me. This was it; this was madness, the Enlightenment was the perception of Unreality. Madness was finding oneself permanently in an all-embracing Unreality. I called it the ""Land of Light"" because of the brilliant illumination, dazzling, astral, cold, and the state of extreme tension in which everything was, including myself. It was as if an electric current of extraordinary power ran through every object, building until the whole blew up in a frightful explosion.
My consciousness, you could say, augmented in a funny way… This thing grows all so pervasively, unbearably too much. It strays me from the typical path, sequence, and structure of being. Despite the torment it lays behind, it still continues to deviate, deeper and deeper. The world is fragmented; there's no holding sense to anything anymore, from the grounded matters to the most abstract. And I fractured into parts, I in pieces and all cohesion lost. There is no I, and I is the whole world; there is no other, and every-self is other. In the unveiled boundaries, all objects turns uncomfortably intrusive, somehow so verily exposed. Existence itself, in every conceivable way, denatured so inexplicably perplexed and alienated; in pieces estranged from each other, disconnected; all loses their meaning, nothing is not tentative nor artificial. Thus, I am, simultaneously diminished and dissociated from the value and vitality of life, yet also viscerally disturbed and shaken. This is the abyss, awakening into the underworld of reality.
Therein lays an all-encompassing existential agony, an unbearable tension. It’s nature to want to reestablish the meaningful sense to every events before your very eyes. Just how much more can you take before you finally lose it? To watch your own self-degradation, while conscious in the every step; the consequences disheartens and pains me greatly, but that too disintegrates into the turmoiled sea of noise. Letting go to this madness seems a respite.",schizophrenia
713,"That only the person living with schizophrenia knows their mind the best. And because of the simple fact that modern psychiatry has not caught up with productive ways to treat the unexplainable phenomenon of schizophrenia, those living with it should not buy into a diagnosis that they are mentally ill, broken, or without will! The mind is fascinating and powerful. There are millions of people living with this diagnosis and just because it seems “not normal” does not deem them broken. My experience is just that….. MY EXPERIENCE. No psychiatrist can wrong or right it. I know that my mind, in all of its existence, has experienced something baffling and fascinating and I have enough intelligence and self will to know that I’m not broken or mentally ill. By my own standards. I would never harm another, nor take my own life. I can’t speak on behalf of all living with it, but only those who are and remain active in their experience, involved and always adaptive are the ones who can can help shift the medical field to proper treatments.",schizophrenia

I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.

My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
715,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
716,"I don’t have schizophrenia but I talked with an online contact about it once and what he passed on was fascinating. He seemed a good guy (who I do know through some limited online contact, just not so well that we seem like online friends), so I doubt he would make up details about his experience, but I’d imagine people’s conditions and interpretations of their experiences would vary.
I was curious about what the voices sound like, and to what extent he could tell the difference in them from his own. Per other answers here some people experience them as being a different sounding voice, clearly separate from themselves, in both the sound of the voice and the speaking context, in some cases as an externally located audible sound. His experience was different, he said. For a long time he couldn’t tell that he was experiencing something atypical, and it just seemed like his mind was noisy, not that there were distinct “voices” or perspectives. Of course he thought his own thoughts were confusing, but I guess the lack of a baseline about what others experience as normal made it difficult to tell the difference.
He said that only after diagnosis and some degree of counseling and practice could he identify which thoughts were his own and which seemed to belong more to a separate perspective. The voices, the sounds of the thoughts, were the same as his own thoughts, in his case. It paints an atypical perspective of what schizophrenia is, since he was describing it not necessarily as experiencing a clearly unified internal self with separate perspective intervening, but as a range of basis of perspective. Only later could he learn to identify with only part of that range, and to dismiss another part as separate. Medication of some sort helped limit the experience, if I’m remembering what he said correctly.
Another part that I remember less clearly was interesting, about how he used drugs and alcohol to counter some of the effect earlier on, but that he found it didn’t really help, so he moved away from those habits. The part that still seems interesting to me is the degree to which normal people might experience internal reality differently, and to what extent and in what form borderline cases might occur. I just saw a guy at breakfast in a restaurant discussing something with himself yesterday; couldn’t that be either a normal but atypical form of self-expression, or else something else? I never did get to the bottom of to what extent that one online contact actually interacted with what seemed to be another personality form, but my impression was that it wasn’t like that, instead that he just heard voices or had thoughts that didn’t seem connected to his own internal self or ordinary perspective.",schizophrenia
717,"Yes I do. That labels me “crazy.”
I get told a lot, “You don't seem like you have schizophrenia.” “You don't look like you have it.”
When I'm alone with my mind - is when it's the worst. If I'm not on meds? Forget it, It's just a downward spiral. Everyone's out to get me. What was that?? Omg, they are talking about me. Do I smell? Some of the agonizing thoughts I have daily. That's when I am taking my meds..
Now without them?(aka a psychosis) My family hates me. My daughter is going to forget me.. There are bugs everywhere in my house, in my hair, in my clothes, etc. *Buys bug foggers and lice shampoo* Falls into a deep depression. Lays on the couch for days at a time without eating or showering. *Cuts up furniture because people are inside it.* *Pulls outlets out from the walls because I'm being watched.*
To live with it? It's absolutely awful, every day is a struggle and being sober every day is a struggle. I'm fighting 2 demons at the same time but I refuse to let them win.
I came home this past weekend from a long-term rehab program. I got to see my wonderful daughter. When I'm with her everything is right in the world. I forget all about my schizophrenia and addiction. I am 4 1/2 months sober today.",schizophrenia
718,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
719,"So here's something I haven't talked about on quora before: I occasionally hear voices.
I'm in the lowest end of the spectrum: I know they're not real, they're not hostile, they're not even talking to me, and they don't sound like real voices, more like thoughts that just don't come from me.
I think a lot of people experience this, just without considering it audible hallucinations, because they don't “hear” them as much as think them.
So what are the voices like? They usually come when I'm alone, often when I'm tired. Sometimes it's voices I recognise, like my mum's or a friend's, but most of the time I can't tell whose it is. They don't talk to me or at me, as much as just in my vicinity. They almost never make sense. What they say is completely random words strung together in a grammatically correct, yet completely nonsensical, sentence. They could, for instance, say something like “the potatoes are dancing for me”. It's not usually a bother, since I'm alone and can just “let it pass”. Sometimes, though, if I've been really stressed, it'll be like a crowd, screaming these nonsensical sentences at each other. That'll be frustrating. It's kept me up before, when I'd rather sleep.
It's not something I can turn off. It's like when you shake. The more you try to stop, the more you shake, but sometimes you can stop it without knowing how you did it. That's what it's like for me.
What exactly are the voices that mentally ill people hear?",schizophrenia
720,"I heard a variety of voices. A man and a woman arguing about me (one hated me and wanted to kill me, the woman would argue in my defense and try to save me) I believed those two were from the future. I also believed I could hear the thoughts of people (specific people like my parents or someone I pass by in the mall, as well as people in general, all their thoughts all at once) and demons and hellish noises, distorted singing angels, God(radio show host type voice that I believe is my manifestation of God), and an ogre that hid in the attic and would jump down and I’d hear a bunch of thundering stomps and breaking/crashing sounds in the next room.",schizophrenia
721,"The Voices in Schizophrenia are as real as someone standing next to you and talking. It often works like a chain reaction.
Example:
I saw an apple
Voice 1: It is poisoned.

Voice 2: You are the Snow White. All these people are trying to kill you.

722,"Whenever something goes wrong, I tend to hear my own voice. It says a lot of hurtful things. Things that are not true. But my anxiety in that moment makes me believe otherwise.
Sometimes when I drop a pen during an examination or in the class. I hear the sound amplifying and resonating. Making my mistake seem bigger and bigger.
The voice takes over from there. It starts like it would for any other person. 'oh shit!' that's almost always the first thing it says. Then it tells me how my mistake is actually worse than it seems. Carefully it starts recalling all the other things that have gone wrong, switching over to all the things that about to wrong. Slowly it proceeds to tell me how I'm not good enough. How I'm a failure. My mistake deserves to be punished. I'm not doing enough.

723,"A very long time ago it was thought for a short time that I was schizophrenic. I wrote on Quora about a horror story I suffered, and it is just now sinking in, after 45 years, how close I came to being a casualty of the psychiatric racket. Here is the link to the story I wrote:
Glenn Riquito's answer to Can someone show me a picture of a psychopath without their mask on?
I was never schizophrenic, but I know what it’s like to have the symptoms of that disease. Hearing voices is one of those symptoms. That is because those individuals suffer from a chemical abnormality in the brain — in my case that abnormality was a side effect of a certain antidepressant medication — and this causes the thought process to be re-routed. Some thoughts that originate in the subconscious mind don't progress to the conscious mind. Instead, they end up in that part of the brain that processes sound. For example, a schizophrenic person may be hungry, but the associated thought manifests itself in the form of a voice that says, “you're hungry, you should get something to eat”, or something to that effect. In my case, that voice sounded like it was emanating from a television set, with the same sound quality, and oddly the voice was female. When I turned to look at the television set and realized it wasn't on, I knew something was off. How did the television announcer know I was hungry? Especially when the damned thing was not on to begin with? Sometimes bad things happen to people, but that causes them to end up in a much better situation than before — as was the case with me. I used to work at a law firm, and while there I ran across some information that I kept. I would like for everyone who is reading this to check out this website: www.cchr.org.",schizophrenia
724,"I am 46 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia 1.5 years ago by multiple psychiatrists, so I am qualified to answer this as I am experiencing this every day, every hour, every 5 minutes.
I have obtrusive thoughts. I also get tactile sensations of something touching me. It used to feel like something was gripping my right shoulder. At one point, I felt like something was putting wings on my back where I actually felt feathers spring forth one by one in sequence row by row. At the time, I thought I was chosen by God but had been tricked by the devil and it was inside of me. I was completely delusional and hallucinating.
I’m no longer having delusions but I keep getting unwanted thoughts. I am also still getting constant tactile feelings of something touching me or a sensation of a spider crawling on the left side of my ribs. I sometimes also feel something crawling on my back or poking me and get the sensation of throat or lung irritation.
I also get goosebumps all the time as this is happening even right now as I am typing this. It tells me ""I am here."" It even admits to causing the throat irritation. Now, it’s saying that I should not type this out and to stop. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"" in a demonic deep inhuman voice.
When I lay down, I feel snakes crawling underneath me and writhing around. I can also feel something occasionally crawling on me or poking me.
This is classic schizophrenia.
I think the unwanted thoughts are demonic in origin. I cannot audibly hear them with my ears but they are voices in my mind. They are sometimes quiet and behave like a thought but at other times that sound like a person, my voice in fact or they sound like something totally demonic.
One thing is for certain, they always seem to say bad things about God. The voices are definitely from someone else. I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
When I first started experiencing schizophrenia, the voice would pretend that it was my own internal voice and thoughts except they would say evil and cruel things and from out of the blue, they would say “Satan” or “Lucifer” to me over and over. I was freaked out by it and scared out of my mind because I am a Christian.
It even said “my father in hell” when I was shopping for a Bible at a Christian store. I kept wondering, what is wrong with me? Why do I keep thinking negative things about God? Why do I keep thinking about the devil? I would even pray and say, God, why am I thinking this? Please help me! Make it stop!
Then I figured it out. There was another presence with me. I could feel something touch my skin and grip my shoulder or move along my left side. I was horrified and then I felt something move around me. It felt like I was able to detect movement from the spiritual world and could feel something sit down next to me or I could sense footsteps that felt like a vibration to my perception. I know that it was not actual movement but it’s as if I can feel something vibrating my actual perception around me. Almost like it’s a vibration to the camera of my vision. I can even hear a thumping and feel a force of movement when it steps. It just bumped my chair and I can feel it moving along my back and I am about to stop typing and brush it away. But I know it will just reappear a moment later so I am ignoring it for now.
After I figured out that it was not my voice, I stopped hearing my own thoughts in my head. Then, it spoke to me and said that it was a devil and that it was not going to leave. It told me it would be there until the day I died and went to hell. Then it would enjoy tormenting me forever. I was terrified. I even argued with it and said that I was saved because I accepted the LORD Jesus Christ as my LORD and Savior.
I’m telling you it is not my own voice. It is not my mind that is making this thing up. This thing argues with me like it’s another person. It even talks while I am talking and I can’t think two things at once which proves that it is external to me and not me. I can’t think of two completely different things to say at the same time. When we think, it is about something related to what we are talking about. We think about what we are going to say next and the best way to say it.
We can’t think two different things at once. Then again, I guess we can when we lie. All I know is that I just want this to go away but it doesn’t.
The voices I am hearing in my head says things that are completely different to what I am thinking and how I am as a person. They are my complete opposite. They say things that I would never say. Blasphemous things about God and now it’s trying to get me to not believe in God.
It even lies and says it is god but I know that it isn’t. Even when I say ""I don't believe that"" it will try to continue the subject but when I tell it that I know it’s not God, it says ""you got me"" and it gives up.
When I hear this, I just remind myself that God is good and cannot tell a lie. He is full of love and compassion. He would never torment me.
This thing is wicked and cruel. It tells lies all the time. Plus, it is constantly trying to trick me into thinking about selling my soul to the devil by saying things in the first person like I am the one thinking it. I would never do such a thing.
It likes to torment me and make things crawl on me or underneath me when I am laying down. It almost feels like a snake. Its hard trying to fall asleep while this is happening. It’s a total pest. No good being would ever do such a thing. It keeps touching me even as I am typing this by making something feel like it is moving along my back. It’s trying to distract me and pester me. It is even causing a tickling sensation in my throat.
I’ve prayed for it to leave and even went to two different churches where they do deliverance they prayed over me and nothing works. I often pray and continually ask the LORD for forgiveness. Each day, I am still in this personal hell. God help me.
However, now that I know the voices are not my own, I must admit that I feel a lot better once I realized that they were not from me. That they were coming from something else. At first, I could not understand why I would think such a things about God, who I love. Now that I know it is something else, it's easy for me to dismiss the things that it says because I know that I am not the one thinking it.
It’s still disturbing though. No Christian would ever want to hear something singing ""Sweet Satan"" in Jimmy Page's voice from “Stairway to Heaven” played backwards in your head all day. This thing is always twisting things around and it seems to be one step ahead of me when I am thinking something. For example, when I am praying and think my father in heaven it says hell just as I am thinking heaven.
Every day I pray for God to drive this thing to the hell from which it came but this continues every day. It’s now been 1.5 years.
Also, when this started happening and to this day, I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
One other thing I want to point out is that this creature can even play music or bring up scenes from movies to illustrate a point. On occasion it will make a sound in my head like the devil from The Exorcist. Other times, it says things like they are my own thoughts without an actual voice. In fact, most of the time its how it communicates except when it wants to be really annoying. Then it talks in a voice that sometimes sounds like my own or it warps it and sounds like something completely demonic.
Whatever it is, it is not human. It says things no human would dare say. Things that I would be afraid to say.
It totally sucks ‘hearing’ voices. I would not wish this upon anyone. I just felt it laugh at me just now.",schizophrenia
725,"As a person with schizophrenia I can only explain what I hear to a certain extent. For me it doesn't sound like voice in my head. It's more akin to over hearing a conversation. I can definitely tell the difference between my thoughts and the voices. I hear them on plans, out on sea and everywhere I might be. It's a mix of males and females voices. Other sounds might make the voices louder. Like fans, fridge's running and air conditioners. Even if I plug my ears the sound still get to me. I don't hear them in my dreams, but when I wake up for moments to reposition I will hear them again.
What they say usually verys a bit from person to person. I actually don't tell people what they say exactly. As I don't wish to bring the nonsense into my world anymore that it's already present. The majority of what is spoken by the voices is a manipulation of some sort. It generally consists of tactic to make one lower there guard and accept the voices as “friends"" only to twist that trust and cause devastating repercussion. Once I learned that it's all a big manipulation, I cease responding to them.
The voices are actually intelligent and learned that I was not falling for the trap and now tend to just repeat my thoughts and what I read. It can be annoying when they repeat everything but I just play music to not hear it as much.

The Downward Spiral (The Bottom) by Nine Inch Nails.
Insanity feels like this to me. The only time I ever felt this was during past 2 week boughts of unrelenting mania. Sometimes I listen to it for comfort, when I’m alone in the world and need some support, a connection usually otherwise refused.
Long before, during, and forever after, Nine inch Nails was Trent Reznor’s gift to me that he wasn’t trying to give. But could never have been something intentional anyway. It’s like someone so close to you, you barely speak about your feelings, they’re understood and felt alongside you. If I ever had the pleasure of running into him, I’d smile and wave and say thank you quietly. Then after I got around the corner I think all the pain would fall out uncontrollably, like my memory farts, only with such an explosive force, I think it would sound close to what I’ve only heard people describe as being the death rattle, a loud terrible noise made after death has taken over a person. Eh, I hope I never have to hear it for anyone, I’d never be able to stop hearing.
If that type of noise were to come from me body I hope like hell he’d know in that situation that was the sound life makes after it happens in a person, and he’d keep walking.
Years ago, not many to me, he found a good loving woman who held his heart as well, and he married her. He had two children with her too. People were such assholes about her that they had to take the message boards on the Nine inch Nails website down. She was a playboy model, and I think that was everyone’s issue. You know, how dare Trent Reznor fall in love with a woman that didn’t fit the standards of his main audience own choice of lifestyles, and clothing they choose to associate with his music. Hahaha I was happy for him. And I was delighted that it pissed people off.
Dear Jesus, get a life, idiots.
Dear Trent,
I haven’t checked in to see if you still have the family you deserved, cause you always did, and it would break my heart if I found out that you simply had a moment of happiness.

731,"One of my best friends in high school was abducted by Schizophrenia — which unfortunately ran in his family — and he never came back.
Mom, brother and himself. That was the holy trinity which succumbed to the very same condition while his dad could only watch and cry. Mom hanged herself, brother found her and was wrecked for life, and my friend tried everything to survive to no avail.
The condition got to him in the end as well, and he had to be committed for a while because he thought he was someone else (and he was). He had become obsessed by a singular truth — one single sentence which described every truth (“The Sentence of Everything”), and had stopped eating and cleaning up in the search for it.
He also defecated in his room before they found him. For weeks.
It was university life that triggered the hole thing — his grades were growing bad, and he could not cope with that, and it exploded in his face. Stress marked the spot. Just like that.
We reconnected when he was back in town, and I was going trough a divorce. But I hardly recognized him anymore. He had become a silent movie version of himself — his every single movement and conversation happened in slow motion, as if he had become a victim of the famous Encephalitis Lethargica bout in the 1920s.
But when his eyes widened — that’s when the real thing happened. Then he was looking at people who weren’t there, and sometimes he interacted with them in an unguarded moment, as if he had forgotten about me.
One time in a pub when I came back from the restrooms, he was having a heated conversation with a figment of his disease, and was totally upset when he suddenly saw me, as if he was busted during a secret and forbidden moment. And I guess he really was.
After a while, the voices got the better of him, and it became impossible to see him anymore. He was totally overtaken by his condition, and in the end succumbed to the voices and the orders they had given him.
Just like that.

732,"Voice-hearing experiences are influenced by one's particular social and cultural environment. ... Tanya Luhrmann found that voice-hearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the United States, the voices are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful. [Hallucinatory 'voices' shaped by local culture, Stanford anthropologist says]
As an experiment for CNN, Anderson Cooper tried a schizophrenia simulator, but couldn't make it through the whole day. ""I mean, it's eye-opening because it kind of really shows you what it's -- what other people must be going through who deal with this on a regular basis,"" he said, adding, ""But also, like I cannot wait to take these headphones off because it's -- it's really depressing... It makes you feel very, very negative. Yes. It's very creepy. I want it to stop.""
Here is a sample of what auditory hallucinations can sound like, ""based on things our clients tell us they hear through my experience as a mental health outreach worker."" (The video came with a warning that it may be disturbing, and that headphones will intensify the realism of the experience.)",schizophrenia
733,"From personal experience there are a few cues, but most of the time they speak like most people.
I cannot speak for everyone but my mother in particular speaks in stops and starts, she often rambles onto tangents and seems to pull words from the air rather than them sounding premeditated or casual.
She also doesn't seem to particularly care whether the person who she is talking to is paying attention?, most people trying to have a conversation or lecturing someone would try and catch their eye or get annoyed when hat person tunes out. She never does this and seems to content to ramble on.
She also has much more acute mannerisms, like pointing with her middle finger or breaking up her speech with a seemingly unearned and long laugh.
Now, obviously this is an individual case and I've never met another schizophrenic so I'm not sure if these themes are shared but this is my experience with schizophrenic behaviour.",schizophrenia
734,"First and foremost, I agree that you should not call any people crazy. I know that you quoted and it is meant to be in a mental illness context, however, there is no need to use that word.
with regards to those with mental illnesses, there are many conditions that may cause people to hear voices. Generally, when people hear voices, it means that they are in a psychotic state. However, very few people among the mentally ill actually hear voices.
Think about a time when you stood there and you heard something, then you turned around, but you could not locate the source of the sound. Nevertheless it's still sounded like normal i.e. you still did hear it.
Hearing voices in your head is similar to that. The Sensation is the same in that you do hear something, just like you would hear people speaking in your dreams, however in reality nobody is speaking to you. You have no control over when these voices say something and you have no control about what they have to say. In some cases people heare multiple people talking to each other at the same time like a conversation. In other cases the patient may hear one person talking at this one time, then another at another time. Most voices described by people who hear voices in their head talk about negative things. Somebody told me before that they heard the voices telling them that they were being chased by aliens, and that the aliens were sending messages through every communication channels to them, such as on the TV, on the radio, etc. Another person told me that they heard people talking to them about drugs dealing in the supermarket while in fact there was nobody saying anything. This same person also said that the other group of people standing there in the supermarket was talking about drug deal. Those people were actually a small family looking at the frozen pizzas and not saying anything.
Those who hear voices usually fall into categories: they may know that those voices are not real or they may think that those voices actually exist. The first group usually seek help and usually would get a better chance of recovery. The second group try to react to the message that those voices are sending, they may run away to avoid the aliens, they may try to tell the police that it drug dealing is going on. Since they don't know that it is untrue, these people do not seek help and they get very offended when there is an effort to treat them. Naturally the first group has a much better prognosis.
I hope that this satisfies your curiosity. Mental health is a very complicated field and it is further complicated by a combination of ignorance by the population, denial by those who are affected, and the inability of the patients to comprehend the illness. If you do care, it might be a good idea for you to read more into this subject and to see if there is any volunteer opportunity in your community to help the mentally ill. Sometimes, a simple gesture like giving out educational materials may contribute a lot to mental health awareness and progress in research.",schizophrenia
735,"I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I experience auditory hallucinations OFTEN. Almost every day.
I'll hear my loved ones screaming as if they're being brutally assaulted.
I'll hear former acquaintances (FA) laughing while these horrible deeds are played out for me to have to hear.
These FAs can read my mind, because they are my mind essentially, but not any good part. They want me dead.
I do my best to not converse with them. But it's very difficult. I often find myself literally biting my tongue so as to not verbally communicate with them, because then they'll know i hear them. But then I find myself talking to them in my head.
I also talk to my own self in my head, but they're always there and they're almost always negative and unkind. Sometimes I'll hear how things are supposed to unfold. Let's say I hear them planning that my “friend” doesn't really want to come over, and then in actual reality, my friend ends up not coming. Or I'll hear the voices say “so and so you need to call/go over there” , and then so and so calls/shows up. Those things usually happen when I'm home alone/by myself.
I'm usually alone when I respond out loud to them.
When i do, it basically “lets them know” i can “hear” them, and they proceed, even more incredulously, with explicit and cruel remarks.
Sometimes I'll scream or yell, beg, bargain, and plead how to make it stop. ~ Usually makes it worse.
So Everyday I have to battle them. I have to Decide that living my life is better than listening to them destroy it.
I still really don't know what is real. I have to rely on that my loved ones are being honest with me about what is/isn't happening.
Sorry for rambling on. I'm still figuring it all out for myself.

736,"Well, most of my voices just sound evil, like Disney villain evil, but there are a couple that sound like the right brain from Bo Burnham's song Left Brain, Right Brain. If you dont know what I'm talking about he has it (and all the clips from all of his specials) on YouTube, so go check it out. As for the second part of your question, it's kind of both. What I mean by that is there are multiple voices, but if you're medicated properly, you can only focus on one at a time (for those of you who are properly medicated and hear no voices, congrats, you're in the very minor minority). Just imagine you're in a stadium, you can hear the buzz of all the conversations going on around you, but you can really only eavesdrop on one of those conversations at a time. And no, I'm not exaggerating when I say stadium instead of something smaller, like a restaurant. I have literally thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of voices in my head trying to get me to kill, torture, or fuck everything in sight, both living and not, all the time in my head, except for the radio squad, which are a small group (and by small I mean a couple dozen that I can hear), which play my favorite clips of catchy songs in my head 24/7. Oh yeah, and if you want to see what I think my voices would look like, look at the Asylum album cover by Disturbed. Hope this helped.",schizophrenia
737,"Okay, this is *fascinating!*
The auditory hallucinations (voices) that people experience who have schizophrenia, are largely influenced by the culture they are a part of.
So while voices might be more typically negative and harsh here in America, they aren’t always elsewhere!
“In the United States, the voices are harsher, and in Africa and India, more benign…The striking difference was that while many of the African and Indian subjects registered predominantly positive experiences with their voices, not one American did. Rather, the U.S. subjects were more likely to report experiences as violent and hateful.”

738,"I do like Kaila’s answer. My voices are ‘localised’ to my life and experiences. Sometimes, I think it is psychic, but regardless it is a hell of an experience. You just sit there and suffer, but to an outsider they cannot see what’s wrong. The calling card of a schizo in the West is an obese, nicotine addict on social security benefits.
Ok I am hearing voices now. I can hear a woman shrieking at me. I hear a man speaking. This episode of voice hearing began in 2010 and it is hard to make it what the words are. This is an improvement for me.",schizophrenia
739,"Well, the ones I know sound like you and me.
When they are angry they sound like angry people even though their anger may be related to their illness.
When they are frightened, they sound frightened…just like you and/or I would sound. My sister is genuinely frightened of the rats she sees in the malls and she sounds just as any other person who is frightened would sound.
So…as long as the subject being talked about is a rational one you wouldn’t be able to recognise someone with schizophrenia. As they “descend” into an episode, it becomes clearer to recognise the illness. Not because of a speech pattern so much as because of the subjects being talked about. Much deeper in an episode it depends a bit on the type of schizophrenia; my sister as example will talk less and less and sound more and more disconnected but her voice is still the same and if you didn’t know that the subject is totally irrational you still wouldn’t pick her as someone with schizophrenia.",schizophrenia

741,"You can be diagnosed with schizophrenia without delusions, hallucinations, hearing voices, or other such symptoms that are defined as positive schizophrenia symptoms. The positive symptoms are the manifestations most commonly associated with schizophrenia. The people you might see on the street yelling at the moon exhibit positive symptoms.Schizophrenia - Wikipedia
Psychiatrists have diagnosed me as schizophrenic with mainly negative symptoms. Negative schizophrenia symptoms are flat emotional effect, anhedonia, cognitive confusion, and having difficulty dealing with societal expectations. There are few functioning schizophrenics, and the schizophrenics can have both the positive and negative symptoms. Most patients with the negative symptoms diagnosis also have depression. Depression and Schizophrenia together are diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder.
Schizophrenia with or without delusions or hallucinations is a mostly hopeless situation and cannot now be effectively treated. There is no cure and the anti psychotic drugs given to patients are usually spit out by the medically sophisticated patients unless they are in a clinical environment.
Schizophrenics do a lot of self medication, alcohol, nicotine, THC, Benzodiazepines, and even opioids. The doctors do not approve of schizophrenics taking drugs not prescribed by doctors. Schizophrenics will say they would rather be dead than take the anti psychotic drugs prescribed to them.",schizophrenia
742,"Yes. Absolutely. I have schizophrenia, and I’m not entirely certain, but I’m fairly certain I have had little to no hallucinations. My problems come in the form of delusions and paranoia for the most part.
A lot of people think that people with schizophrenia always have hallucinations, but this is just not the case. Also, most people don’t know the difference between hallucinations and delusions, so I guess they get them confused. Hallucinations are things that are not there (technically), but the person thinks are there—things like voices, touch sensations, olfactory sensations, etc. Delusions are thoughts that are relatively bizarre and have no basis in reality—things like thinking that you are God.",schizophrenia
743,"Yes, sometimes it is a trippy interpretation of the world without hallucinations of any kind. For example when I was in The Priory I thought the stained glass windows in the dining area were like giant bluebottle flies with green bottle ends for eyes. Green bottle blue bottles to make the mind feel mad. I thought they were originally designed to put people off their food too. They were subliminal flies and it felt like only I was consciously aware of them. They would make people feel that the place was dirty. I gazed up at the beasts as I ate my food and wondered about how the others brains received them.
A woman there said she was interested in architecture and I mentioned the windows to her. I wanted to talk about them but felt it would be wrong. Unveiling the windows secrets could be bad for people perhaps.
I had a memory of looking at a blue bottle fly in infant school and telling people I thought it was beautiful. It felt like my peers distanced themselves from me. My instinct told me I was alone in finding the fly beautiful. And then it felt like I was alone with the fly.
I relived this experience in the dining room. I felt that I was safe from the malicious intent that had put the giant flies there. Because my natural human repulsion to flies was overturned at a young age as my mind opened to their beauty.",schizophrenia
744,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
745,"I doubt anybody can be diagnosed with any type of schizophrenia if they have never experienced, or just do not experience any hallucinations at all. To me, a hallucination is very similar to what a delusion is, as though both of these things coincide in my mind, almost like an unreality, that I would believe is too real without help from my medications, or anything else I have learned about and understand that can help me be more attuned to my own reality. A person that just has problems in life, and sometimes has to get a grip on reality, or something like that, is not schizophrenic to me. That is just a problem with life issues, or whatever is occurring with that person that makes them think they might be having a bad “hallucination,” etc. I sometimes start believing that friends I know of, are trying to destroy me, or that they are talking to me, about things they don’t like about me. That to me is called delusional thinking, accompanied with hallucinations. I would rather want people to believe they are normal. Like a bad trip, you see, I just don’t think that kind of thing equates to having any kind of mental illness. Having a mental illness is kind of actually like being destroyed, in the self.",schizophrenia
746,"Yes, but here’s why documentation doesn’t exist. #1. HIPPA protects the privacy of medical records, but…..#2. Even if that were not true, there is patient confidentiality. As a therapist, it’s not ethical for me to say to you, or anyone else, what my calculous was for making the diagnosis. #3. Psychiatric diagnosis is not based on objective tests, it’s based on self reporting.(why? Because there is no proof for any of this in science) And people can lie. In the famous Rosenhan Experiment, psychiatrists at top academic psychiatric hospitals could not spot fake patients. #4. Diagnostic criteria are checklists. Here’s part of the one for “schizophrenia”; “Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech. #5. If this doesn’t make a lot of sense to you, welcome to the club. #6. What it boils down to is this; nearly anyone going through a really rough patch can see a moron (because anyone can become a therapist) for six months, and it the therapist doesn’t think he/she is improving, and the therapist is not particularly empathetic towards the person, or there is significant mistrust, that individual can be the proud owner of this arbitrary yet permanent label.",schizophrenia
747,"Absolutely. Thought disorder, disorganization symptoms, mood symptoms, ipseity symptoms of basic understanding of self and how the world works. Deficits in being able to learn and apply behaviors in life. Negative symptoms. It is an absolute shame that psychiatry cannot do anything about these disabling symptoms, although new medications and treatments are in clinical trials psychiatry has royally failed in doing anything of meaning for people and instead its endless stigmas, endless mistrust, continued endless disability. These people are treated like crap because negative symptoms are looked at as a personality flaw and something intentional and decietful and there’s no representation of these people. Shame",schizophrenia
748,"Yes. I have schizophrenia for 4 years and don’t have any hallucinations except for - one psychotic episode couple years back that lasted a day and dream like states I encounter during my sleep (closed eyes and lying down) where I feel I lose a sense of reality for a few seconds but come back to my awareness- this has started happening recently.
I hear voices and see images but I don’t lose awareness when this happens. Contrary to what is believed Hearing voices, seeing images are not necessarily hallucinations. They are audio and visual manifestations of the demonic entity trying to connect with you (demons can transmit media to you). Delusions can be there (more common in serious cases of schizophrenia) where patients lose awareness of reality- here they see or hear things as if in a dream and believe it yo be real. But these delusions also are mostly a play of our imagination circuits by the demon. I have been scrupulously observing this for past 4 years since it began. Before that I have lived a very happy, focus and accomplished life.
Schizophrenia is demonic interference with human beingness. If you are an aware being you may feel the suffering but not have psychosis that easily. It also depends upon what the demonic entity is here for or how it decides to play with you. In my experience they have access to our mind and body aka thoughts, feelings, imagination, beliefs, cravings etc. They can add their own content or modulate yours.

I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.

750,"Yes.
But.
It’s unlikely to stay that way. I knew a girl a few years back, I’ll call her Rachel (not her real name). Rachel was 23, and we were admitted to the psych ward around the same time. She had scitzoaffective disorder (scitzophrenia + a mood disorder, in her case it was depression). Rachel was quiet, but we ended up talking. She told me that she had been hearing a voice since she was about 15. She said the voice was always kind to her, and told her positive things. Rachel was very religious, and she told me that she thought the voice was God. She didn’t realise she was unwell, she was just listening to God speak. The voice kept her company, helped her cook new recipes, and although her friends at school often thought Rachel was “odd”, nobody ever thought anything was wrong. This continued for years. Rachel grew to love and trust this voice of God. Slowly, the voice started to change. It told her to hurt herself. She did, because she trusted the voice, and at this point, followed anything it said. Things escalated. The voice told her to smash a brick over her head, to kill her dad (she didn’t), to jump in front of a train (she tried). Rachel was grabbed by the police on the train platform, and taken to a 136 suite (emergency psychiatric hold in the UK which lasts up to 24h where you are assessed to see if they need to admit you to hospital). She was admitted to hospital under section 2 (28 days) and treatment began. She got better, basically, although the voice never fully went away. The medication quieted it, and she came to realise that it wasn’t God after all, and that she needed to challenge what it said to her. But the point is, yes, hallucinations CAN be all positive. Maybe even for many years. But things change, and you could end up in serious danger.",schizophrenia
751,"Not always
My hallucinations can sometimes be quite obvious and sometimes not
For example:I'm laying in my bed relaxing,suddenly I hear weird voices or I feel like somebody is watching me.I look around,open my room’s door and open the windows.
Nothing
I'm alone at night ready go to upstairs and into my bedroom to sleep.I turn the lights of in my living room and turn the lights on in my stairway.I walk upwards normally,suddenly I have the feeling something is behind me and I run upstairs as quickly as I can ,I rush through the door,jump on my bed and stare at the doorway.All light are still on and I just stare for a couple of minutes…nothing else,I even breath very quietly.Then I stand up with my phone in my hand and maybe a pillow or anything I know is actually existing.I go to my door looking straight forward.I look at a black dot at the wall or just something that's ALWAYS there,something I know that should always be there.Then I go outside my room,still staring at that one and then I just instantly look downstairs .I just look down and the ground at the end of the stairs.Then I keep looking at that point on the ground while going backwards into my room,when I can't see the ground anymore I instantly look back at that black dot (or whatever I stared at before leaving my room). I go with my hand around the corner to turn the lights in my stairway off.I keep looking at that dot while going back to my bed.When I reach my bed I just lay down,put my phone right in front of my face and turn it on.I see messages from friends,my girlfriend or random messages from games and so on.I then just lay on my bed watching videos,talking with real people I know or doing things I know are real.
There was nothing in my stairway
There was nothing behind me
I know that, but I don't feel it
I'm playing a videogame with my friend.I hear voices and think…there can't be any voices,I have a headset on and I hear music and my friend’s voice.
But I feel these voices,I hear them ,my mind is telling me that there are voices but I know there aren't
“There can't be any voices” is what I always tell myself in these kind of situations and that helps me…but not completely
I listen to music very loudly with my headset on while my mom is watching TV next to me
I hear a voice and suddenly jump up,throw my headset off and look around…there was no voice,not even my mom was talking
What I'm trying to say is that I'm totally aware of what is happening (most of the time). I know that these voices,sounds and feelings aren't real but I'm not feeling that and I sometimes don't even have a prove
My family and friends always tell me that I'm drifting off very often,that I don't listen to them or that I live in my own world (aka daydreaming,listening to loud music and playing videogames intensively)
But I do that on purpose because my mind needs to be full,it needs to be COMPLETELY full,so I know what's real and what's not.
When I just hear music these voices make me go crazy,scare me and shock me
When I do nothing they make me confused and irritated
But when my mind is completely full I can ignore them
I know they aren’t there,I know they aren't real
But I need prove of it",schizophrenia
752,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

753,"Before going in the direction of schizophrenia, be aware that severe depression can have affect-related delusions and hallucinations.
In its extreme form you might have delusions of cancer, parasitism, or other morbid conditions, as well as mood congruent hallucinations of voices commenting on personal worthlessness. There also can be shifts in reference, which seem to be what you are describing.

Now I am going to complicate this a bit—if your main problem is not a mood disorder but the sorts of ideas of reference you describe then in principle you could have a schizophreniform disorder which may have secondary depressed mood, so this really can go either way.

754,"Yes…I worked with many schizophrenics who did not have hallucinations. Schizophrenia is primarily a thought disorder…thinking not connected to reality or thinking that bounces all over the place. Delusions are part of thinking so you can be delusional without having hallucinations.
I believe hallucinations are a secondary, not a primary symtoms of schizophrenia.
Also, hallucinations are primarily audio…if you have visual hallucination it could be related to other factors.",schizophrenia
755,"People with schizophrenia have at least two of these symptoms for at least 6 months. One of them must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. A single voice that offers ongoing comments about your thoughts and actions, or voices that talk to each other, is enough.
There could have been times when you didn't have any symptoms, but the first one would have started at least 6 months ago. And you must have had them for at least a month continuously.
You may have different symptoms at different times, and they may get worse or better - and it's still schizophrenia.

756,"The schizophrenic Spectrum can encompass a wide variety of experiences, and for some people it includes distortions such as auditory and visual hallucinations. For some, it doesn't. Just as with paranoia and sleep disturbances, the symptoms are not limited to schizophrenia. Even a person who does not appear to have a mental illness or disorder can experience hallucinations and paranoia from time to time, responding to extreme stressors and chemicals. Schizophrenia often will run in families, and it is also closely associated with other disorders that are completely treatable, such as borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. Is unclear yet weather the clustering of these disorders within families is entirely genetic or if there is also a component of shared coping strategies, reactive behaviors, and receptiveness to professional help. Whatever your situation, you may find relief and being evaluated, perhaps even learning a bit thru therapy whilst ur feeling strong. Best.",schizophrenia
757,"Yes: what Kraeplin used to call “pure paranoia” does not have halucinations or any other imaginary phenomena (apragmatism, emotional bluring, maneirisms, etc) - only a very coherent and strong delusion, which is an excelent prognostic. This appear in the series F20 of the International Code of Deseases by the World Health Organization (United Nations) as F29 “persistent delusional disorder”, and the criteria for that diagnose is presence of a delusion that is central to the psychic life of the patient, but with no other psychotic phenomena.
But those are rare. My first psychoanalysand was in fact one of those - and I feel extremely lucky for that…!",schizophrenia
758,"I am 46 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia 1.5 years ago by multiple psychiatrists, so I am qualified to answer this as I am experiencing this every day, every hour, every 5 minutes.
I have obtrusive thoughts. I also get tactile sensations of something touching me. It used to feel like something was gripping my right shoulder. At one point, I felt like something was putting wings on my back where I actually felt feathers spring forth one by one in sequence row by row. At the time, I thought I was chosen by God but had been tricked by the devil and it was inside of me. I was completely delusional and hallucinating.
I’m no longer having delusions but I keep getting unwanted thoughts. I am also still getting constant tactile feelings of something touching me or a sensation of a spider crawling on the left side of my ribs. I sometimes also feel something crawling on my back or poking me and get the sensation of throat or lung irritation.
I also get goosebumps all the time as this is happening even right now as I am typing this. It tells me ""I am here."" It even admits to causing the throat irritation. Now, it’s saying that I should not type this out and to stop. ""I wouldn't do that if I were you"" in a demonic deep inhuman voice.
When I lay down, I feel snakes crawling underneath me and writhing around. I can also feel something occasionally crawling on me or poking me.
This is classic schizophrenia.
I think the unwanted thoughts are demonic in origin. I cannot audibly hear them with my ears but they are voices in my mind. They are sometimes quiet and behave like a thought but at other times that sound like a person, my voice in fact or they sound like something totally demonic.
One thing is for certain, they always seem to say bad things about God. The voices are definitely from someone else. I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
When I first started experiencing schizophrenia, the voice would pretend that it was my own internal voice and thoughts except they would say evil and cruel things and from out of the blue, they would say “Satan” or “Lucifer” to me over and over. I was freaked out by it and scared out of my mind because I am a Christian.
It even said “my father in hell” when I was shopping for a Bible at a Christian store. I kept wondering, what is wrong with me? Why do I keep thinking negative things about God? Why do I keep thinking about the devil? I would even pray and say, God, why am I thinking this? Please help me! Make it stop!
Then I figured it out. There was another presence with me. I could feel something touch my skin and grip my shoulder or move along my left side. I was horrified and then I felt something move around me. It felt like I was able to detect movement from the spiritual world and could feel something sit down next to me or I could sense footsteps that felt like a vibration to my perception. I know that it was not actual movement but it’s as if I can feel something vibrating my actual perception around me. Almost like it’s a vibration to the camera of my vision. I can even hear a thumping and feel a force of movement when it steps. It just bumped my chair and I can feel it moving along my back and I am about to stop typing and brush it away. But I know it will just reappear a moment later so I am ignoring it for now.
After I figured out that it was not my voice, I stopped hearing my own thoughts in my head. Then, it spoke to me and said that it was a devil and that it was not going to leave. It told me it would be there until the day I died and went to hell. Then it would enjoy tormenting me forever. I was terrified. I even argued with it and said that I was saved because I accepted the LORD Jesus Christ as my LORD and Savior.
I’m telling you it is not my own voice. It is not my mind that is making this thing up. This thing argues with me like it’s another person. It even talks while I am talking and I can’t think two things at once which proves that it is external to me and not me. I can’t think of two completely different things to say at the same time. When we think, it is about something related to what we are talking about. We think about what we are going to say next and the best way to say it.
We can’t think two different things at once. Then again, I guess we can when we lie. All I know is that I just want this to go away but it doesn’t.
The voices I am hearing in my head says things that are completely different to what I am thinking and how I am as a person. They are my complete opposite. They say things that I would never say. Blasphemous things about God and now it’s trying to get me to not believe in God.
It even lies and says it is god but I know that it isn’t. Even when I say ""I don't believe that"" it will try to continue the subject but when I tell it that I know it’s not God, it says ""you got me"" and it gives up.
When I hear this, I just remind myself that God is good and cannot tell a lie. He is full of love and compassion. He would never torment me.
This thing is wicked and cruel. It tells lies all the time. Plus, it is constantly trying to trick me into thinking about selling my soul to the devil by saying things in the first person like I am the one thinking it. I would never do such a thing.
It likes to torment me and make things crawl on me or underneath me when I am laying down. It almost feels like a snake. Its hard trying to fall asleep while this is happening. It’s a total pest. No good being would ever do such a thing. It keeps touching me even as I am typing this by making something feel like it is moving along my back. It’s trying to distract me and pester me. It is even causing a tickling sensation in my throat.
I’ve prayed for it to leave and even went to two different churches where they do deliverance they prayed over me and nothing works. I often pray and continually ask the LORD for forgiveness. Each day, I am still in this personal hell. God help me.
However, now that I know the voices are not my own, I must admit that I feel a lot better once I realized that they were not from me. That they were coming from something else. At first, I could not understand why I would think such a things about God, who I love. Now that I know it is something else, it's easy for me to dismiss the things that it says because I know that I am not the one thinking it.
It’s still disturbing though. No Christian would ever want to hear something singing ""Sweet Satan"" in Jimmy Page's voice from “Stairway to Heaven” played backwards in your head all day. This thing is always twisting things around and it seems to be one step ahead of me when I am thinking something. For example, when I am praying and think my father in heaven it says hell just as I am thinking heaven.
Every day I pray for God to drive this thing to the hell from which it came but this continues every day. It’s now been 1.5 years.
Also, when this started happening and to this day, I no longer hear my own internal monologue. The voices are able to drown out my own inner voice. I only know my own thoughts as I am thinking them but I can’t hear them in my own voice.
One other thing I want to point out is that this creature can even play music or bring up scenes from movies to illustrate a point. On occasion it will make a sound in my head like the devil from The Exorcist. Other times, it says things like they are my own thoughts without an actual voice. In fact, most of the time its how it communicates except when it wants to be really annoying. Then it talks in a voice that sometimes sounds like my own or it warps it and sounds like something completely demonic.
Whatever it is, it is not human. It says things no human would dare say. Things that I would be afraid to say.
It totally sucks ‘hearing’ voices. I would not wish this upon anyone. I just felt it laugh at me just now.",schizophrenia
759,"This question is not easy to answer, and I especially have problems because I don’t know what YOU mean by the word “hallucinations.” An “illusion” may be a symptom of Schizophrenia, but that word also has meanings not involving a psychiatric disorder. For instance, if you take a pencil and hold it in the middle and waggle it up and down really fast between your finger and thumb, you get the illusion that the pencil has lost its stiffness and is curving. That is a visual illusion. Someone who is convinced that Democrats have imprisoned little children in the basement of Comet Ping Pong Pizza and are sexually abusing them and magically sucking the life essence out of the children so that the Democrats may live longer, is suffering from an illusion (false belief) There is no basement in Comet Ping Pong. They are mistaken. Neither of these examples indicate mental illness (though you think that the Q-anon followers who believe the second might be, but, nope, they are just wrong). I really like the definition here: APA Dictionary of Psychology.
In order to know that you and I are using the same definition of the words “hallucination” and “delusion” (the word you may have been aiming for), we have to be working from the same dictionary. So use the one I linked to and learn how the psychiatric world uses those terms.
At MedicalCriteria.com DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Schizophrenia you can view the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association criteria for Schizophrenia. Here is the first of six criteria:
“The presence of at least two of the following five items, each present for a clinically significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), with at least one of them being items 1, 2, or 3:
1. delusions,
2. hallucinations,
3. disorganized speech,
4. grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and
5. negative symptoms (e.g., decreased motivation and diminished expressiveness).”
Back to me again.
To decipher the above; Someone with Schizophrenia has one or more of these three symptoms:
Delusions, Hallucinations, or Disorganized speech.
Here, I will link you to the third one: APA Dictionary of Psychology
You are going to have to refer back to your search for the definitions of those first two. Figure out if the person really does have the medical definition of any one of these three things. If they do not, they do not have schizophrenia.
If they do, look at the rest of this list. Does the person have either of those? Don’t cut corners, look up definitions of them, and look up definitions of any words that you do not understand in those definitions - this is why it takes at least six years of college to be able to suggest a probable diagnosis to a psychiatrist (that is what an MSW therapist like I was does). You have to understand all the terms. Okay, does the person have at least two of the five things in this list? If yes, go on. If no, then either you do not understand the medical definitions of the words used to describe schizophrenia symptoms, or you are not aware of all of the things going on with the person, or they do not have it now. It may be developing, and they have some symptoms, but do not currently have the full disorder. Or they may have something else. Or they may not have anything.
But these five symptoms are just the start. The rest of the diagnosis goes through a lot of other factors that can rule OUT Schizophrenia. If you have a “No” for the next two criteria, you are not seeing Schizophrenia, or it is too early to tell.
The fourth criteria asks that the doctor consider if the person really has a different kind of psychiatric disorder that sometimes involves some psychotic symptoms.
The fifth criteria makes the doctor look at the physical condition to see if the person has an underlying physical illness that can cause a psychotic, or psychotic-like symptom. Or does the person have any substance use (prescribed or bought on the street or grown or gathered) that can lead to these symptoms? If this criteria is yes, then they may have a different problem and it is not usually a mental illness. This must be investigated. Does the person use a med or substance or have an illness that could also account for them having the symptoms, but also has Schizophrenia? You have to get rid of the other substance or illness to know for sure.
Lastly, the sixth criteria reminds the psychiatrist to really assess things to make sure that the person who qualifies as having a psychotic illness does not have a different one than Schizophrenia. There are a few.
See why it takes a medical degree, then many years of study and practice to become a psychiatrist, to be able to give a diagnosis?
And do you see why I could not give you a “straight answer?” We have to be speaking the same language, first! Psychology/Psychiatry has a language much more precise than how the general public uses similar or even the very same terms.",schizophrenia
760,"Yes. Auditory hallucinations are common, but not required for a diagnosis. Having delusions and thought disorder are important in the diagnosis. And these must last so to speak for at least six months, and bizarre behavior, social withdrawal. The hallucinations are what the general public thinks of. My son has schizophrenia but claims he’s never heard voices.",schizophrenia
761,"Hallucinations : an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present.
Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren't real. ...Schizophrenia is a mental illness that causes psychosis, but schizophrenia also has other symptoms hallucinations Negative schizophrenia symptoms are flat emotional effect, anhedonia, cognitive confusion, and having difficulty dealing with societal expectations. there are few functioning schizophrenics, and the schizophrenics can have both the positive and negative symptoms? And it isn't the only cause of psychosis!",schizophrenia
762,"Yes. You can have delusions, disorganized thinking, paucity of thought, or a plethora of other symptoms all of which are psychotic. Also, many people with hallucinations do not believe they are hallucinating. To them it’s just a totally factual thing that actually is happening. So you can be 100% sure you are not hallucinating when you are. Most people with psychosis also suffer from something called anosognosia. It is an inability to know that you are sick. It’s actually caused by the brain. So self evaluation of psychosis is often impossible.",schizophrenia
763,"My middle son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia since he was 16 and he’s 25 now. This sweet soul is very empathetic. I have never seen him angry, never seen him depressed, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him even sad. He always looks at the bright side of things and is so resilient beyond belief. His delusions that I am aware of have never even been scary. He has always had silly delusions or delusions like one time he went missing because he thought he was signed to a record deal. It was still scary for us because he can easily be taken advantage of. But all schizophrenics are not the same. Matter fact just the people I have met that have schizophrenia are more in danger of being taken advantage of or hurt by others than them dangerous to other people",schizophrenia
764,"From my own personal experience, I truly believe schizophrenics feel empathy just like any one. My Brother who was a year older had schizophrenia. I began to notice his symptoms at the age of six. He wasn’t diagnosed until his late teens, but by that time it was to late to help him. My Brother was very violent, and he murdered a good friend with his bare hands. I was not only his sister, I was his best friend and the only mother he’s ever known. My Brother had more violent episodes than I can count, many times in front of me. It didn’t matter how bad these episodes were, my Brother was always conscious of my presence and would never hurt me. I had earned an unbreakable trust with my Brother, not an easy thing to do with a paranoid schizophrenic. Even though he was capable of hurting animals and people, my Brother had the biggest heart of any one I’ve ever known.
I believe the love I shared with my Brother, was more powerful than his mental illness. His violence was aimed at everyone around him, but never once towards me_
Thirty years ago, my Brother was committed to a prison for the criminally insane for the rest of his life. But, fifteen years ago, he was diagnosed with brain cancer. A tumour the size of a grapefruit, was found in his head.
Six weeks later, my Brother passed away at the age of forty one_
My heart goes out to all people stricken with schizophrenia, and the ones that love them_",schizophrenia
765,"I am schizophrenic and can tell you that it is not true schizophrenics don’t feel empathy. I feel empathy more powerfully than the average person. Growing up, I always made sure I had money to give homeless people in Chicago. I have always looked at life from the viewpoint of the other person so as not to hurt others. I think what most people don’t understand is that schizophrenia often feels like a battle to keep ones soul from being overcome by the voices that are in their head. I have voices, I call demons, in my head trying to make me believe bad things about people. The way I counter is to choose to see good in people. I tell the voices that people aren’t as bad as they say. And then I imagine the actions of others to be working toward good, even if their actions hurt me. I do fear that someday I won’t be able to counter the voices. But schizophrenics are often violent and I choose to do all within my power to prevent that from happening. I choose to see good in people and my life is better for it. I also get angry with the energy that makes me feel anger towards people. This protects me from becoming a victim of the disease and the empathy that can accompany it.",schizophrenia
766,"Individuals with schizophrenia are capable of experiencing empathy exactly like anyone else. Certain symptoms may interfere with their expression of empathy during a psychotic episode. For example, negative symptoms may include a significant reduction or near absence of emotional displays, communication, and motivation. Individuals experiencing these symptoms may spend most of their time in isolation or fairly disconnected from others. Some call this an ""alienation"" from others.
Individuals can also become so disorganized and disoriented they are unable to meaningfully communicate or interact with others. In these situations it would also be difficult to interpret empathy. This does not mean they are not experiencing empathy. It definitely does not mean they do not experience just as much empathy when their symptoms are in remission. I will add many individuals with schizophrenia never experience negative symptoms or disorganization. Many will never have their ability to express empathy impacted in any manner.",schizophrenia
767,"Allow me to re-write the question. ""Do people with schizophrenia feel empathy when they are in the midst of a serious or severe episode of symptoms?"" People with schizophrenia have a wide range of how they experience psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confused or impaired thought process). Most people, after they begin to experience these symptoms, experience symptoms episodically, anywhere from a few hours to weeks at a time. A few have symptoms continually. During periods of symptoms many people are so caught up with their symptoms that they can not focus upon the experience of others, therefore they are to varying degrees unable to experience empathy. Others, with mild psychotic symptoms are able to experience empathy even while they are symptomatic.
Between episodes most people with schizophrenia are able to experience empathy to the same degree that they were able to experience empathy before they were diagnosed.
Lastly, some people with schizophrenia who have had symptoms for some time, and who have been able to achieve some control of their symptoms, due to the depth of their personal struggle may be more able to experience empathy more than before they began to have schizophrenia. This is much the same as anyone who has a serious disability and has been humbled by the experience, and then are able to fully understand what others go through.",schizophrenia
768,"As a parent of an adult son with treatment resistant schizophrenia I can say without a doubt empathy does exist at least in my son’s case. Prior to his diagnosis he was kind, generous and had a great deal of empathy. He was diagnosed in Feb 2013 and to this day he still has those traits. He’s been hospitalized 14 times since his diagnosis. Many of those were for more than a month at a time. The first 2 years he turned to alcohol and it got so bad I thought my son would die. I realized I had to get tough and make decisions that he may not like but now he is conserved and living in a board and care. He’s been on his meds steady for almost 2 years. Although he still has constant symptoms and his reality isn’t ours he is a very kind, generous and empathetic young man. He knows he is welcome to come home for day or overnight visits but I explained that when he lived with me he didn’t do as well as he does now and we don’t want to risk going back to that very dark time. His response to that was “mom I know you love me so don’t worry about it”",schizophrenia
769,"Yes we do. We show it by saying things like, “Wow that must be horrible! I had the same thing happen to me before… Are you all right?”
This might seem a bizarre thing to say to a person who just experienced something painful or scary or hurtful, but you’d be surprised how much having someone to relate to and knowing you’re not alone can help someone in a bleak situation.",schizophrenia
770,"This is an extremely interesting question. I have recently become very interested in “looking into” schizophrenia - my heart BREAKS for schizophrenics, I cannot help it and there is actually an article about it. It is a neuro scientific study that showed there is a empathy deficit in people with schizophrenia. They are still trying to understand whether or not there is an actual neurological cause or there is an impaired pathway in the mind of a schizophrenic that causes this. This will take a long time to get real answers on, however, the majority of subjects that they tested did have this empathy impairment.
May I play devil’s advocate for a moment? Perhaps it has nothing to do with the disease of schizophrenia itself. Perhaps it is a person with a diseased mind who has suddenly become almost “demonic” in the eyes of society. Suddenly, people who were once people are now cursed, evil, diseased. While doctors and nurses might not treat them badly, even families sometimes are “afraid” of their family members, and certainly society is not friendly toward the “dangerous” schizophrenics. I’ve seen the way people treat those who they THINK are schizophrenics…I think lepers are treated better. I’m not saying that there aren’t reasons to be frightened of ANYONE who is in a psychotic state, but a person with a problem is a person with a problem. I’ve been more comfortable around schizophrenics than I have some drunks. If people treat you like you are something that just crawled out of the cemetery, I would lose my concern too, and I don’t have a mind that is being wrecked by a terrible disease. Just a thought.
There is evidence - scientific - that many schizophrenics do not possess empathy, that is not saying all of them of course. I have read some articles on a personal level, people in mental health forums, who said that they believed once they were receiving treatment for their schizophrenia they were able to “regain” their empathy. I would love to be able to answer your question with one definitive answer, but I don’t think that there is one. I think it comes down to the people who have it. The same as every other mental illness and every other person.",schizophrenia
771,"This is an excellent question but one Im afraid that has a difficult answer. There are numerous studies that have been done that unfortunately have conflicting results. There are those who claim the Amygdala, that part of the brain that determines and controls emotional response, is less active in those who are afflicted with Schizophrenia, they react emotionally at a slower or lessened rate or none at all compared to those with normal functions. But these results have their detractors with those claiming that even though Schizophrenics may react at a slower level they still do experience both emotional and empathetic responses. I personally dont believe you can generalize the results as they may be different on a person to person basis which would explain the difference in the results of these studies. Sorry I couldnt give you a concrete explanation and answer.",schizophrenia
772,"I don’t know why some individuals have insisted on making this question a schizophrenia art contest and never actually answered the question.
Anyways, mostly yes, but their empathy is noticeably impaired. Studies have shown that schizophrenics are less empathetic on average due to different cognitive defects (Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia). Google “Schizophrenia and Empathy” and you will find countless other studies to back this up.
Also, the orbitofrontal cortex in schizophrenics is damaged (Orbitofrontal cortex abnormality and deficit schizophrenia). This area of the brain is responsible for morality, impulse control, and proper social behavior. This might be one of the prime causes for lower empathy among schizophrenics.
So, most are not totally unempathetic, but most certainly lack empathy to some degree or another.",schizophrenia
773,"I have lived experience. I endured seven hospitalizations from 1969–87, and was “labeled paranoid schizophrenic.” Since then, I stayed out, take no meds, and do not indulge in traditional psychotherapy. In fact, I am thriving.
Along with lived experience, I have been in hearing voices groups, attended conferences, and done extensive research.
People who are labeled “schizophrenic” are, in most cases, like everyone else. Please read my article: 15 Truths About Schizophrenia Many People May Not Know
Anyone with a life problem will at times be very self-absorbed. This might appear to be a lack of empathy.
This label, “schizophrenia,” like all of the rest of the diagnostic psych labels, are subjective, not scientific. They are harmful. Boiling a person’s life experience down to one word carries very little information. I’d prefer to hear the experiences than a label.

774,"I wasn’t always schizoaffective, and I don’t really think people loose their human qualities when they gain the diagnosis. If a person was empathic beforehand, they probably will always be. I am to a fault. I had to create a one chance policy with people, because I care so much, and it hurts when they do something to purposely hurt me. I did it before the diagnosis, and I do it now. The strange thing I’ve noticed is that people don’t know how to be alone. Everyone seems to rather have a terrible friend, or friends than to not have one at all. I want a quality relationship, where people care as much about me as I do them. I’ve always felt that way.",schizophrenia
775,"I've been hearing voices and other things for about six years too. Actually a lot of people have. Something may have happened in 2012. I wonder if it was the beginning of the end it has been called the mysterious demon invasion. Since then I've been locked in an alternate reality. I dodon'deny that I technically have schizophrenia I just define it differently. Since this has happened I've been studying psychology, spirituality, demonology, etc. I almost have my degree and a 3.95 g.p.a. to me the mental illness we face is just a symptom of a worse spiritual sickness, it's very complicated. That's why when we get very sick doctors can't find anything wrong with us because it is sickness of the spirit. As for the question why schizophrenics have more empathy. Modern psychology would say that we have a influx of mirror neurons in the brain that allows us to feel more empathy than others. Psychopaths on the other hand have far less and feel no empathy. They are cold calculating and analytical. Schizophrenics are more intuitive. The voices you hear are not auditory hallucinations they are beings from a dimension most humans can't see. The reason it feels like their following you everywhere is quite the opposite. My own theory is that we aren't actually moving we only have the illusion of moving in a illusory world are spirit is actually stationary as are the beings (demons)",schizophrenia
776,"Yea I think a lot of us are actually really nice and experience empathy. Delusions are such perception altering experiences that we can appear as if we have none when we’re having them. Basically imagine a time when you were so consumed by something that you didn’t give much thought to the people around you. That’s what delusions can do to people. We’re also prone to feeling of persecution and we’re obviously not going to feel empathy for, or be kind to, people we think are persecuting us. I do genuinely think a lot of schizophrenics are kind people underneath the psychotic symptoms.",schizophrenia
777,"This question seems simple but the answer is not so simple.
Just like any other subset of people schizophrenics in this regard are a mixed bag, they may or may not normally feel empathy without the effects of schizophrenia being added into the mix itself.
Almost all people living with Schizophrenia tend to need medication to live a relatively normal life… and for the most part, they probably are empathetic people, some more than others, some may even be hyper-empathetic.
Some medications have effects that mess with hormones (like a particular antipsychotic called risperidone) and various other medications have other various effects to a person’s behaviour and/or body… from “Zonking” them out to be zombie-like to minor effects to major issues and side effects.
Lastly, someone with Schizophrenia may undergo a state of Psychosis. This means that empathy may not be relevant any longer when the person behaviour is not rational. During this state, they are generally not in their “right mind” and could act in any way, it’s not likely that one can expect empathy or behavioural control from them while it lasts.
I hope this helps in some way and I wish you good luck along with many future…

778,"Hi. I am diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
No. I, and other people whom I know with schizophrenia , do NOT lack empathy or sympathy for others.
The opposite is true. I unfortunately have more than the normal amount of empathy for other living things. I'm a vegetarian because, as Ghandi said when he ate lamb, ‘I can feel it bleating all the way down.’
I will do everything I can to help people in need, when I am able, because I have suffered myself in that way. I will do everything in my power to help those who cannot help themselves, because, with schizophrenia, I have been in their place.
I cannot read expressions on people's faces easily. Others think I am disinterested when in reality I can't read their emotions correctly.
People think I am unfeeling when I cannot move the muscles in my face to smile or respond with normal expression. My face sometimes looks, and feels, like stone. People mistake that for lack of empathy. Or for hostility.
It is not.
Give someone with schizophrenia a kitten to hold, and then decide if they lack empathy.
You might be surprised.
Thank you for asking this question.",schizophrenia
779,"Um, people are not schizophrenic, people HAVE schizophrenia. People are not their diseases. Also, people with schizophrenia can very well be empaths or empathetic, in some cases too much. I have worked with adults with schizophrenia i a residential setting for several years. Most of what mutes a person with major mental illness’ (MMI) ability to connect with others is the side effects of medication and our expectation on people’s abilities. If you are in a setting where you are the caretaker of someone with schizophrenia there are a lot of rules for the staff to encourage people to mind their own business, not try to help others, and isolate them. It wasn’t a very good model when I was working there. I hope it’s improved but my feeling is that as long as we have low opinions of what someone with MMI is capable of there will be beliefs in the negative of what they can do.",schizophrenia

781,"Yes, people with schizophrenia can feel empathy just like anyone else. Schizophrenia affects thoughts, emotions, and behaviors but doesn't necessarily diminish empathy. However, the symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions or hallucinations, can sometimes make it challenging for individuals to express or recognize empathy. It's essential to understand that schizophrenia doesn't define a person's capacity for empathy. If you or someone you know is struggling with schizophrenia, seeking support from professionals like Dr. Tonmoy Sharma can be helpful in managing symptoms and improving overall well-being.🌟",schizophrenia
782,"NO!!!!!
This is an extremely dangerous question and if you find yourself asking it GET HELP! A pwbpd suffers from a very serious very severe mental illness (they aren’t someone with a few issues). It’s easy to think they interpret reality like the rest of us and they DON’T. They have what’s called dichotomous thinking (black and white thinking also referred to as polarized thinking). That’s the reason they split and either idealize or devalue EVERYONE. They DON’T experience things like normal people nor do they understand many situations. To a borderline everything (EVERYTHING) is either wonderful or horrible, great or catastrophic, you’re an Angel or a Demon, a savior or an abuser. They will always see the world through that lens. With treatment they can learn coping skills to behave in a manner that looks more normal.
If you asked this question you’re a very hurt codependent partner who’s trying to make sense of why your pwbpd could hurt you so severely. The only answer you’ll ever get is “THEY HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS”. I’m always surprised by the amount of partners of borderlines who describe some of the most abusive, irrational, toxic behavior and want to understand what it means. Like the word mental illness lost meaning or that the borderline tricked them into thinking they aren’t mentally ill. Let’s just say to a pwbpd bizarre, irrational, toxic, and destructive behavior is more normal than not.",schizophrenia
783,"Schizophrenics have lower “emphatic accuracy”, they do not have lower levels of sympathy (was this your real question?) than the normal people, since normal people only have sympathy for people they “know”. Normal peoples “emphatic accuracy” is high and that helps when they do sadism.",schizophrenia

785,"We met in December.
I was living on my own after 15 years and when I met him I had just fallen off the wagon after being sober for two years. Of course in true Alisha fashion I gave up my love affair with alcohol to pursue my dreams of being an artistic powerhouse only to run back to booze like a jaded lover. It is this time I drink and fall the hardest in the shortest amount of time.
My dream, my goal, my future aspirations sounded crazy to everyone around me except for him, the only other person I know of that dreams in the same language I do.
The night we met I knew by the look on his face I had seen through the big bay window in my living room that he is going to be so much more than a night of drinks. With one look I could feel that he is going to dance with my soul like no other.
It is his presence when he comes inside the house that gets my attention. As he talks it's like he's taken the words I've learned to live by right out of my head. As the night carried on he and I go for a drive to the liquor store. It's on the drive there that I knew he was a game changer. When he spoke of the universe, love and gratitude with the street lights illuminating behind his head it gave me goose bumps I can still feel to this day. He kissed me in the parking lot when we got to the liquor store.
It was amazing.
We hit it off so well I can say the sex that night was as good as our first kiss. We talked until the sun came up. I immediately pushed him away and tried to find faults in him. The next time he came over we hung out until the morning again only I ended it with him. We stayed friends and my life went so far down I didn't believe anyone could make it back up let alone myself, but I did.
The whole time I thought about him and I just knew he would be there for me. In a way he pushed me to get up again without even trying and I thank him everyday for that even if he hears it or not.
He told me he would hear voices from time to time. He made it seem so easy to have schizophrenia that I would often forget. It wasn't until he stayed at my house for a few days without his meds that I noticed the difference. I started noticing big differences that became loud and impeding on us. I was in such a fragile state that I couldn't handle things properly so I would take things the wrong way and he as well. We break up more times than we see eachother.
He started doing things to piss me off, to push me away. He would just disappear, not physically, his body would be present but his mind would travel elsewhere. He was never present acting in a hurtful way towards me. Then one night it was like he came too again and we had an amazing talk. It was that night I realized the gravity of schizophrenia and how it weighed in him.
He mentally came and went. When he left he would be the exact opposite of his true self. He told me he didn't like hurting me that way and I truly believe him. I know he loves me that much that it really messes him up to know that his other self brings pain to my heart.
Then one day he told me the voices were back and he slept for days. I couldn't do anything and it broke me inside. Then he would be more distant and argumentative. He wouldn't listen to anything I said and he called me names.
Then one night he had an episode infront of me. He thought I was an actress hired by his family to lure him to my house so they could kill him. He showed me where he thought there were microphones in his car and he pointed at people only he could see. I cried so hard while he asked me if this was real, if my tears were real. I sat in his car next to him for eight hours talking to him and randomly interupting him to say ""Baby, Baby, Baby, I love you!""
Each time I said that he calmed down. Bit by bit he came back. When he cried saying how tired he was from the negative noise he always heard my heart broke in ways I never thought it could.
That night made me understand what schizophrenia is on a different level giving me a deeper understanding.
He asked me why I didn't leave or get freaked out by his mental health. I told him that when he's present, feeling himself and being his true self that those moments he is here and talking to me are so amazing that I would hold on for a life time just for those few minutes of being with him.
I hope that one day he can always be present and he can just hear the sounds of us chattering away in silence, that would make all of the pain worth fighting through. That is why I stay because when those moments happen they are as beautiful as his mind is.
However, it will never work and I know this. He's suspicious of me, he calls me the worst things in the world. It's as though he just acts out what's in his head. It's like I have exactly what he has but he's doing it and he's the only one. He scares me sometimes and that's when I realize it shouldn't be. When he goes away life goes back to normal.
I hope him the best in life.",schizophrenia
786,"I did briefly. My best friend Charles and I dated for four months shortly before he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He had an IQ of 145 and was one of the most well-read people I've ever known.
I had always believed we mutually ended the relationship because we realized we were just better friends than lovers. Before he died, though, Charles told me the only reason he'd wanted to break up was because he had been having psychotic delusions that my son's father was teleporting into my bedroom at night. He said it wasn't even the fact that he thought I was cheating on him, it was the idea that he was preventing me from having a nuclear family.
It had been more than a decade since we'd officially dated and I was happily married when he told me, but it still broke my heart a little. He said once he was diagnosed, properly medicated, and came to see that it had all been in his head, he figured it was too late and our chance had passed.
He was right, of course, but I hated to think that things could've been so different if it weren't for the damn schizophrenia. I mean, I love my husband and kids, and I wouldn't trade them for anything, but Charles never seemed to fully recover from the diagnosis — not from the schizophrenia, mind you, but from the diagnosis. He always felt he had less to contribute to a relationship than a ""normal"" guy. From my standpoint, he had way more to offer than most guys, schizophrenia or not.
I've never regretted our time together. It brought us closer as friends so we felt we had nothing to hide and could talk openly with each other about literally anything. I wish he'd found happiness with someone else and recognized what an amazing person he was and how much he meant to so many people. I miss him terribly.",schizophrenia
787,"first of all, you are not your illness.
i was in a relationship with this guy i loved so much, and not even once, it occurs to my mind that he is the “schizophrenic” one, when im thinking of him.
even back then, whenever i thought of him, the first things that came to my mind was how brilliant,loving, and adorable he is.
the way he laughed,his eyes,his smiles,and every single detail about him that made me fall for him in the first place.
the love i felt for him was the thing that made him different with others, not the illness he was suffering from.
that being said, his illness was not something as simple as an occasional flu.
ever since i was a kid, developing schizophrenia was my biggest fear.even the idea itself would give me a nightmare.i recall watching a documentary when i was seven,and that was the age i became obssesed with that disease.i avoided looking at myself in the mirrors, cause i was scared to see someone thats not me!
anyway, years later i fell in love with the nicest guy ever, and that was when i realized that if there is something worse than having a serious mental disease,it would be watching one of your loved ones struggling with it.
there were times when he had a psychotic episode, and he wouldnt recognize who i am.he looked me in the eyes,and the numbness would make me freeze.
sometimes he felt so paranoide that im not me, that im a duplicate of myself or a delusion.
he would hallucinate that he had killed me or his family, and there is blood on his hands that wont go away no matter how many times he washed them.he actually smelled the blood, that would cause him nausea and blackouts. sometimes he started crying so hard, that nothing would calm him down.
and many many other things, it was all so hard to watch. so hard.
literally the hardest thing ever.
and he would beg me to leave , saying that i deserve a better life, he felt so guilty for all the stuff we were going through at that time.but as i said, he was not his illness and neither are you.
he was the most amazing person i have ever met,and i’ll ever will.he was the “once in a life time” kind of guy, and having him in mylife was definitely worth ANY hardship to go through.
so im not going to lie, it was hard. it was so damn hard watching him suffer like this.
and schizophrenia,the disease itself, is still the nightmare.
but struggling with that doesnt make you any less worthy of experiencing things such as great love or unforgettable relationships in your life.
it all depends on who, yourself, are.
and the one who deserves you, would already know that.
i hope it helped, sorry for the grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

788,"For me really hard. I rarely meet their basic expectations, I am aloof to the point they leave or become obsessed with winning me over. I have bad mood swings & don't trust them much. I don't have much sex drive. I'm not somebody I'd want to date at all. I've had a few relationships, none that have lasted more than a few months and I'm in my 30s. Relationships aren't that important to me but sometimes I try once the person realizes what I am like and still wants to, but generally it is draining for us both and I never ever feel lonely to begin with so I'm over it quickly. I guess most of my relationships are like this…. I'm fairly attractive so it's been pointed out to me attractive + distant means mysterious to people. So somebody becomes really into figuring me out, we talk over text for a while, they develop feelings (my feelings change fast & aren't very strong about everything) and try to ask me out which I decline and make excuses for a while, eventually they ask again & I explain basically I don't want a relationship because I'm not good with them. They say I'm wrong & I'll give it a chance just to eventually prove to them that I wasn't lying, I am in fact awful to date & they either leave or relentlessly try to get me to change.",schizophrenia
789,"Yeah, we don’t do that. Dating is for people to feel each other out and make sure the other one isn’t insane. There’s a certain missing element there; can you figure out what it is? ;) If a schizophrenic wants a relationship, they’ll have to start with friendship and find special meaning with their friend.
First there’s the Insecurity. Every time our potential significant other runs a test on us, we’re going to intentionally fail it. Even if it’s some super-subtle test, our subconscious minds will find a way to absolutely assure you that there’s no way we’d ever pass that test. Especially if it’s like one of the main things that makes us who we are, especially if it’s something super-critical to you.
Did I mention we’re not a person? It would be like dating a space station. You might think it’s pretty in the night sky, and occasionally traveling through inter-dimensional wormholes IS pretty cool, but you’d suffocate in that world. You’d freeze to death. Your eyes would EXPLODE. Look, it’s just not a good match.
You probably are a very, very caring woman with a very sensitive soul to be asking such a question. Maybe your soul is super-tough, and you think you could handle it. First, you can’t. Space station. Freezing to death. Can’t breathe. Second, you’re the worst possible match for us. When you care a lot and try to help us, we’ll undoubtedly stop caring and not want help and leave. We’re really hopeless.
I heard someone say that later onset schizophrenia might change that. Does that make you hopeful? Well, forget it. It changes nothing. I had plenty of romantic experiences before my life got totally fucked. I’m married to God now more effectively than any priest. You want it? I’m sorry. Please don’t make it my problem. I cannot give it to you. It’s for God.",schizophrenia

791,"I got married to a woman with schizoaffective with severe depression. She wasn’t diagnosed and her symptoms did not become apparent until after we got married.
Before we got married, she was nice and seemed to care and we could talk about many things. Then, there was an immense amount of stress for her around the marriage. Her parents didn’t like it for reasons they wouldn’t state, or that she would tell me (her dad, according to her, criticized her dress and everything about the wedding, only around her). So, once we got married a lot of those stressors started to go away, and who she really was came out.
She became emotionally and verbally abusive. She isolated herself and used manipulation in order to get me to quit my job and drop out from college. She often cut her calves and thighs, and talked about suicide and would get a distant look as often as she was awwake. She had hallucinations that lasted up to 30 minutes at a time and she would curl up in a ball and scream. I tried my best, but I eventually checked her into the hospital for 13 days and then two more times after.
She didn’t even care to be married. All she could talk about was the past and how she wished she could be with her little brother (12 age).
I sent her back to her family after the third hospital visit. They came and I helped pack her stuff up, I still hoped we could salvage the marriage. She refused to see counseling and psychiatrists unless she was in the hospital and I could never talk about myself. That would trigger her hallucinations or cutting or whatever self destructive method she chose.
I don’t recommend it, mine was a hellish year long experience. If you want a one way relationship where you basically become a caretaker this can likely be one. That’s just some of my experience and some of my thoughts on the matter. Tread cautiously, with good counsel and support.",schizophrenia
792,"Do you want the truth or a polite answer?
The polite answer is: You probably shouldn't date a person with a known psychiatric disorder of any kind. It doesn't make you a bad person if you don't want to add problems to your life, and your first responsibility is to yourself.
The truth: I have been married to a bipolar schizophrenic for over fifty years. She needs to take more medications in a day than I take in a year. Over half of my time is spent taking care of her in one way or another. I need to make sure she eats right, gets out of the house, talks to people instead of avoiding them, and so much else that it is impossible to list them all. My service buddies told me not to date her, one of my supervisors tried to get me transferred before I could marry her, and my mother (a psychiatric nurse) told me I would have trouble for the rest of my life if I continued to see her.
One of the reasons I wasn't promoted while in the military was because of her. (That and the facts that I am stubborn, and so politically incorrect I'm in a class by myself.)
I even retired early so that I could take care of her.
All of that being said, she gives me so much more than I give her that it cannot be overstated. She is smarter than I am (though I have at least double her education), can see through people at a glance, can solve problems correctly in thirty seconds that take me days to come to a conclusion (usually wrong) on, has helped me through some of the worst times of my life without ever asking for anything, has sided with me when the whole world seemed to be against me (even when it would have been in her best interest not to), and is the main reason I want to get up in the morning.
She says “I love you” very infrequently, and yet her saying it means more to me than anything I know. She has been the ONE PERSON I could count on in all those years.
When we are separated, it feels like someone is smothering me with a pillow. When we are together, the world coming to an end wouldn't seem too bad, because she is standing there with me.
Follow your heart and GOOD LUCK to you.",schizophrenia
793,"Very few people who have schizophrenia date. Social isolation and withdrawing is perhaps the major problem for people who have schizophrenia. You will find people who have schizophrenia married, but this is rare and usually the marriage happened before the illness began and most likely the marriage doesn’t last. Because schizophrenia comes on usually in adolescence, usually say like in high school before you’ve really even dated, you haven’t learned the social skill of dating. And now you will probably never get there. Sometimes schizophrenia comes on later in life when you’ve gotten some social skills training in your life, perhaps have held a good job, perhaps even made it all the way to college, headed for a master’s degree and then boom! Schizophrenia! A devastating life long incurable illness! It’s found that people who have some life experiences under their belt before the illness takes over, do have a better prognosis than someone who’s never had a boyfriend or girlfriend etc. I can’t say I know what dating would be like because my son does not date. Not saying he wouldn’t like to have someone special in his life, but he just doesn’t know how. It’s a lonely life.",schizophrenia

I remember at one point he was telling me that people was coming in our yard at night swapping out his truck motor, and other parts that belong on his truck. He thought that someone was trying to melt his truck tires just enough to make him wreck or whatever. He even went as far as going toour neighbors and telling them to stay away from his truck. He was convinced that the Dodge dealership was behind all of it, and went to the dealership, it was embarrassing, however I love him and I stayed by his side, I’ve done a lot of apologizing, and cleaning up behind him when he gets manic, the worst is whennhe hits the depression stage of it. I have held him countless nights while he cried asking me to please don't leave me like everyone else does. But when he is in that manic state he swears that he isn’t crazy, and there is nothing wrong with him.

796,"I'm not sure if you mean as a person with schizophrenia, or if the person you are dating does. I can answer for the former.
Unfortunately this answer may not be incredibly helpful as I don't have any experience of dating without having schizophrenia.
I suppose in many ways it is similar to the ‘norm’, but reliant on the other person being extremely tolerant. Even with regular medication, the symptoms both positive (things other people don't experience) and negative (things other people experience but aren't present in the person with schizophrenia at that time) still happen, albeit on a more minor level. It helps in my experience if the person you are dating knows a bit about mental health in general, either by knowledge or experience. Yes, I said it, a relationship between two people with mental health issues can work.
The emotions are presumably the same, but as with all other aspects of life, things can get confusing and hard to get a handle on. I think it is important to somehow know when the best time to reveal your diagnosis is, though this will vary according to the situation and be hard to work out. Keeping it secret is probably doomed to failure as you'd just go down as ‘the crazy ex’ as symptoms would show but would be unexplained. And here is where knowledge or experience on the other person's behalf kicks in, to moderate their reaction. Though the chances are if they are observant (necessary) they probably guessed something along those lines.
Now, practical tips. For me, I find texting more helpful with making plans, or writing them down on a calendar or in a diary, because when the world gets strange the written word is a constant. Logic testing everything for likelihood is another one, the same as it is for every other aspect of life. That is exhausting and can give the impression of being slow especially in conversations but otherwise the funny looks start. Obviously keeping up with treatment and appointments is vital (see point one about writing everything down) and the medication tubs with the days of the week on are brilliant.
I hope this helps, much as it possibly can.",schizophrenia
797,"A schizophrenic is fully functional with proper and effective medication. I say effective because antipsychotics which works on one doesn’t work on other person. It takes time to select the right medicine. When a schizophrenic is fully functional, she/ he acts like any normal human being. Due to schizophrenia, the person at time may show more intelligence than others. There are many cases where schizophrenics have married and raised children. So I presume that the dating for a schizophrenic will be a very romantic one.",schizophrenia
798,"Depends on how heavy you weigh towards whichever bypolar type you are, along with all the other characteristics involved in schizoaffective disorder. Me i’m more Manic (think excited 3year old manic) depressive. I’m the most outspoken introvert I know 117 times a day. Whereas my Stepdad is more in the realm of Paranoid Schitzo w/ anger issues to the extreme, but w/ an overabundance of guilt that he gets 100% overcome by it and doesn’t have the tools/ability to properly process and work through those feelings. Communication is definitely key and acknowledging that those shortcomings, or outbursts, or whatever is not your partner, it is your partners condition. They will say and do things they do not mean, at times when they do not even know they don’t mean them. Just like any other relationship. Just expect it a many and more often.
Basically, to sum it up. It’s like dating a spoiled adolescent that has been given all the authority of a responsible adult…

He’s in constant competition with my wandering mind. He has to compete against my delusions, because I always think I’m on this higher plane of reality. He has to calm me down repeatedly when all I see is the doom of our family, or that our car is going to explode or that our stove is poisoning us.

The psychotic episode started just after few months of our relationship, so we've been together through it, and through hospitalization. I can only talk from this experience and I cannot generalize that all relationships with persons with schizophrenia are so beautiful, but I am fortunate that he trusts me and loves me. While in hospital, all his doctors knew about me, because he said beautiful things about me, so I felt treasured. We left a very good impression in the hospital, because he helped every nurse who needed a hand and also helped the other patients to cope with their symptoms. This experience added much more depth to our love, because we shared together the ups and downs of hospitalization, the sorrow and the joy, we prayed together, we learned to be intimate spiritually, because we only had each other. I would’t trade this experience for anything.
I also learned to value each moment, to value health and to enjoy life, and I have a great passion for studying neurology and psychiatry and for fighting the stigma associated with mental illnesses.

I'm kind of stuck. I'm not sure if that's because of the disorder, lol or just me being a female still in love. I just haven't been able (and I have tried) to move on to a knew relationship.

802,"People with schizophrenia have an impairment in that region of the brain that helps filter thoughts. Among the many things that pops into a person’s thinking are moments of fear about the object of their affection. With normal brain functioning, these thoughts are examined and can be temporarily discounted while people learn how the relationship is going to work.
If a person is unable to allay these fears, they will act on them in some way, leading to estrangement. This is true for many types of personalities, but in schizophrenia, fear processing is often over-expressed. They cannot keeps those fears at bay.
I once dated a sweet woman with a mild but persistent level of schizophrenia. Although the relationship was brief, it was affectionate and nice. She was artistic and drawn to nature, qualities that would be soothing to an anxious personality.

804,"My mother is schizophrenic. I want to share my story.
Life had been difficult and it is still now. In my childhood, I've seen people treated me differently. People would mock about my mother. My adolescent mind would get hurt badly. I wondered why my mother acts so strange. It always felt like I never knew her. As a person what is she? what she likes or dislikes. I've seen other women doing makeup, dressing well. But I've never seen my mother that way. I wondered how she looks like when she dresses well. Later I found some old photographs of her when illness didn't yet attack her. I saw an woman in those photographs who is so beautiful. Her eyes on those photographs looked so charming and happy. Will I ever be able to know that person?
I've seen my mother rebuking my father without any apparent reason. She is in her delusions, a kind of false perception of reality. Its hard to connect with such kind of person. Even hard to love. But I've seen my father loved her unconditionally and without any complain, she is the woman of our family.
Yes, family life was a total mess with mommy can't do her co-ordination properly. People would generally avoid visiting our home. My mother didn't tolerate other people to come to our home. Her delusions would get kicked on those moments. She thought, those people coming to our home are her enemy. We became socially isolated. It was hard to maintain social life. Well-wishers found it difficult to help us. People would have happy family days on festivals, we would have nothing left. I've passed so many gloomy days.
In the beginning of her illness, there were so many superstitious speculations. My grandmother thought, some evil spirit had possessed her daughter. She tried every kind exorcism to evict the spirit. It was all horrible to watch those rituals. As expected, all gone in vain. Later my mother was hospitalized as a mental patient. The correct treatment started there. Since then she is under prescribed medication. It will continue throughout her life.
It's hard to live with a schizophrenic person. It's not hundred percent curable. Constant care and continuous medication is necessary. Someone near him/her must act as a 24/7 caregiver. An immense stress which sometimes makes life harder.",schizophrenia
805,"Relationships vary according to the people in them, that is the biggest factor more than any mental illness.
My relationships before the onset of illness were fairly one-sided, that is, I was doing all the giving and forgiving. So having these types of friends and boyfriend meant that as soon as I was sick, everyone jumped ship and found other people to exploit. My only good friend got burnt out, because it was a couple of years before I got any treatment. I was sometimes completely flat, other times paranoid, a completely different person.
In the interim, there were 'the boyfriends'. I would not normally be a person interested in casual relationships. But my libido was high, and each time I thought this was the one I was going to marry. These men enjoyed the opportunity for sex.
I did, eventually, find the one I wanted to marry. It has been seven years since we first met. He looks after me, I look after him. We have a mature partnership.
You might be getting the idea that I must be immature or have poor social skills, but I don't. I have very high emotional intelligence, shown fron a young age. But this is what a major mental illness can do.
I have a volunteer friend, who has helped me gain the confidence to make some new friends, of which there are quite a few now. I do pass off as completely normal, but I'm not fully back to myself.",schizophrenia
806,"I was married to someone who was schizophrenic, in the beginning I thought we were just going thru the usual marriage woes. The first 5 years was awful, he randomly but systematically went MIA, until one day he tried to commit suicide, in the middle of the day, with all of us home. This is when the dysfunction really kicked in, (as if the first 5 years of dysfunction wasn't enough), and after countless unexplained episodes occurred, he was diagnosed with having schizophrenia. After many failed attempts to get him help, three failed efforts where he'd begin treating with meds, but after the 3rd week, he was back to drinking and the good ol faithful revolving door is back again. I tried so hard to get him the help he needs, I did extensive research on mental disorders, this is when I discovered the word Bipolar. I tried so hard to fix him, I wound up losing myself. We had 3 kids together, and he had 2 boys already from a previous. We often had all 5 kids together at home. Child rearing was difficult, our home was very dysfunctional, but that became my normal. I wanted so bad to keep my family together, but the dysfunction I lived thru finally sent me over the edge. We separated, and when I least expected it, he fled to Texas with my kids. Eventually I join them in Texas, but I realized the problems followed. We move back to CA, I go my way with my daughter, he went his way with my boys, still in the same city.. The anger he had because I refused to reconcile only brought out the worse in him. During the last few attempts to seek professional help, while helping him fill out his initial consultation paperwork, he reveals that he's been hearing voices for years, and he's always thought it was me behind the voices. That's when it all made sense, the voices were behind all the unexpected and random blow outs we had thru out the years. But, by this time, I was holding onto our last thread, I couldn't hold on anymore, I was done. My oldest son witnessed the bulk of our dysfunction, it was beyond traumatic, it followed him as he grew up, he suffered with us, it lead him into his own depression…., he passed away 12/9/2016, drug overdose. Til this day, I have a very hard time trying grasp and understand why he never showed up to his own son's services. Still separated, depending on which side of the coin he's on, he's either my friend or my worse enemy, so the random torment still exist. Two years after my son's death, my husband passed away, the drinking, diabetes and an untreated foot injury lead to his demise. I was supposed to be somebody, I grew up with both parents, I never experienced the type of dysfunction my kids had to live thru. After my son's death, I've shut down completely, I compare myself to Humpty Dumpty, once he fell, he couldn't put himself back together again. Losing my child, my first born, I've become disabled mentally, the guilt I carry for trying so hard to fix their dad, when I should have been trying to protect my kids. I used to be a strong woman, but I lost my strength fighting my marriage and then losing my boy was the final plunge.
This all took place over the course of 19 years. Once he revealed the voices and his diagnosis, and after my continued research on mental disorders, I can't blame him, because he suffered too from an illness he didn't ask for. I can't even begin to imagine what it was like for him living with schizophrenia. I just wish he would of been responsible by treating it, and maybe our lives would have been manageable. RIP to both, my son and his dad. 😪",schizophrenia
807,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
808,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
809,"I was married to a man with schizoaffective disorder for 14 years, together for 21 years. His was late onset, and didn’t start until his mid 30s.
I’ve seen so many things that broke my heart. The hallucinations (visual and auditory), the delusions, and the anger and frustration of not having control of your mind. It’s a mental illness that not only crushes their soul, but also the soul of the people who love them.
The saddest thing I saw during our time together was the day he found “the seeds”.
I came home from a work trip, and found him passed out on the sofa, arm hanging off the side, and his hand dripping with blood. I dropped my suitcase, and ran over to him. My mind immediately went to a bad place. No, no, no… please don’t let him be…
He woke up, looked at me blankly, and said “I found seeds in my hand. They know where I am now.”
He believed that seeds had been implanted in his hand, by people who were “listening” through the seeds. He had taken about a dozen Polaroids of his hand; then he proceeded to try to dig out the invisible objects with an Exacto blade. There was a pool of blood on the bathroom floor, a trail to the sofa, and it had soaked into the carpet.
I carefully cleaned and bandaged his hand, blotted up what blood I could, gave him one of my Xanax, and he finally fell asleep.
I locked myself in the bathroom and cried. I cried for his pain. I cried for not being able to convince him to get help. I cried because I guess, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew this was the beginning of the end.
Things got better with treatment, for a while. Then it spiraled out of control. When it came to the point that my life was in danger, we divorced.
I haven’t spoken to him in probably eight or nine years. I’m happily remarried, and have the most beautiful, amazing husband I could ever ask for. I have a wonderful life. But I’d be lying if I said I don’t sometimes wonder if he’s still here. I hope he’s found happiness. I hope he’s in treatment. Most of all, I hope he’s found someone who loves him, like I have.
I saw so many things that would break your heart, but the scene I walked into that day is stuck in my mind as the saddest.",schizophrenia
810,"In high school, my friend Neil was rather remarkable.
He was smart, a very good athlete, extremely outspoken, and he was born with a strong sense of justice. He often got engaged in fights when someone was bullied, and he always stood at the right side of the conversation.
I immediately liked him.
Although he quickly became one of my best friends of the time, he rarely talked about his family.
I knew he had a brother, and I also knew that at some moment in time, that brother attended our high school, but now he definitely was not here anymore.
Neil did not say a word.
Only much later — near the end of twelfth grade, he explained that his brother had mental problems, and that he was psychologically unstable. But that was only since “the darkness” happened.
I did not know what that was.
On one evening — an evening of drinking bootleg tequila, smoking cheap cigars and listening to Nirvana — he finally told me.
His mother had committed suicide about five years ago, and I was the first he told in person. Except for some family members, nobody knew.
Even the neighbors did not know. They thought she had left, and his dad never spoke about it.
(His dad had always been a very quiet man.)
She has been suffering from schizophrenia, and became convinced she could talk to Jesus when she was standing in doorways. (This is not a joke.)
When she could not handle the voices anymore, she hanged herself, and Neil’s brother was the one who found her. And something cracked.
A couple of months later, Neil traveled abroad to study in another country.
It turned out to be a mistake.
But he had his mind set: he wanted to be free, be away from home and “the darkness” (which still very much lived in his dad’s house), and learn a new language while he was at it.
University studies in a new language turned out to be hard, and deeply ashamed about his failure, he kind of faded from my life.
In the meanwhile, I had (finally) met his brother, and he turned out to be okay.
Since it was next to impossible to be in contact with Neil, his brother filled in the gap in some sense, and we often went out to have drinks with other friends.
Dan was trying law school, was pretty smart — not like his brother, but still — and very strange.
When he talked about “the darkness,” he often collapsed in total silence, staring into emptiness. He was obsessed with “what people were saying behind his back,” and it got worse, and worse, and worse.
One day, he called me, shouting “he knew what I was saying about him,” and “that he never wanted to see me again.”
And that was the last time I saw him for more than 10 whole years.
A few years later, he was committed to a mental hospital, and when he was discharged, he was a different person.
Locked inside himself, closer to “the darkness” than ever before.
When Neil surfaced again, something had changed.
There was “a new darkness” now, and it had ruined him.
I remembered that the few times I saw him in the last couple of years, he had started to develop this strange idea that one should be able to “summarize entire university level books in one sentence,” and he was searching for this sentence in each and every of his textbook and class notes.
That was how he started to fail courses.
In search for sentences that explain books.
“The new darkness” appeared to be the culmination of his obsession: he was eventually found in a room, sitting on the ground, and writing down sentences on little pieces of paper.
He was nearly starved in this episode of total self-neglect, and his room was filled with thousands and thousands (!) scraps of paper, each containing nothing more than unreadable doodles.
He also turned out to have stolen a wheelchair, in which he drove around, convinced that he could not walk anymore.
But now he was “better.”
I could almost cry to see this man move, knowing he once had been an excellent basketball player, and long-distance runner. He walked at a snail’s pace, talked extremely slowly, and used his hands (and especially his thumbs) in a very weird way when he was talking. (Check out Quentin Tarantino, and you’ll know exactly what I mean.)
He said that he wasn’t able to pass his driver’s exam road test, because everything happened too fast, and he was not able to react.
Even when it was very warm outside, he was dressed in a set of green rugs, wearing an old base ball cap, and looking almost frightful.
At times, he seemed to be absent, as if he was about to fall asleep while talking.
At other times, his eyes were ever so wide, and I strongly suspected him of seeing and hearing things which were not there.
It was then that I realized that my friend Neil was gone, and that he was too far away from shore to be able to get back.
Drowning in “the new darkness,” and fighting the demons of his mother, and his brother.
And suffocating without ever producing a single sound.

811,"“Please, I don't want to. Please, I'm not…”
It was already two pm and my shift finished at three thirty. I was finally heading to the cafeteria for my lunch break when I heard the announcement over the speakers. “Code white, 6C2. Code white, 6C2.” I had a good idea who was the subject of this emergency announcement, indicating an agitated and possibly violent person and necessitating the response of all available staff, because I was assigned to ward 6C2 that day. There was only one psych patient on the ward. 6C2 wasn't a psych ward, (it was a pediatric medicine unit,) but the last empty bed in the hospital was there. The nurses had mentioned to me this morning that they wanted to free up that bed again, as it was occupied by a 17 year old boy who appeared perfectly healthy, and the emergency room had several patients who needed treatment. The patient, Abdul, had experienced a psychotic break at 15, gone on medication, and had been asymptomatic since then. The night before, he had shown up in emergency, alone, stating he felt like another episode of psychosis was imminent. He'd been given a bed for observation but denied having any symptoms except a feeling that he was about to break from reality. Some of the staff suspected there were issues at home and that he was simply looking for a place to sleep. He was calm when I passed by his bed and politely made small talk as I gave a bottle to one of the three babies in the four patient room at the end of the hall where his bed was. That was the situation when I left for lunch.
I was back on the ward within sixty seconds, having sprinted up the four flights of stairs I'd descended on my way to the cafeteria. Abdul was at the end of the hall, naked, and urinating in a large pool that was spreading around his feet. He was also screaming at the top of his lungs, his face contorted and flushed. “I AM SATAN! I'm going to kill you all and I'm going to eat these fucking babies!” Patients and parents were screaming, as some parents, children in arms, tried to put as much distance between him and their kids as possible. Others were frozen, shielding their children with their bodies. Staff were gathered from every ward in the hospital, but no one had assumed control of the situation as of yet and there was no plan of action. It was absolute chaos.
And then his eyes flickered upwards, pleading, and a look of terror passed across his face, which suddenly showed his age. “Please, I don't want to. Please, I'm not…”
He wasn't talking to us. He was talking to whatever force was gripping him from within his own mind. His face was already beginning to contort itself with rage again. But in that moment I saw a chance. “I know you don't want to. You are a good person. Can you focus on my voice? Can you listen to me? We’re going to help you.”
He made eye contact, and held out his hand. I grabbed it, and applied steady pressure, trying to give him a sensation to focus on. A nurse ran forward and took his other hand, and someone else brought a wheelchair and a blanket. “Sing. Can we sing?” he asked. So we sang, children's nursery rhymes, a person holding each hand and jogging alongside the wheelchair, until we reached the treatment room on the psych floor and someone sank a syringe into the muscle of his thigh, putting him to sleep. I got one last look at him, in his sleep looking every bit the vulnerable teenager he was, and not like the man or demon he had seemed to be only minutes before.",schizophrenia
812,"When I went to military school I knew a kid named Mitchell claimed to have permanent hallucinations due to years of abusing Benadryl. Technically not schizophrenia but I think it counts for what the question is asking.
One night we were taking laundry down to the basement of the school where we had to pass by the mess hall, which is what we called the cafeteria. This is a picture of it found off the schools website.
The only difference was that this was about 9ish at night and so it was dark as hell. Well anyway, when we passed the mess hall on our way back I was just having a conversation with Mitchell when he interrupted me with a “Holy fuck” and ran into the mess hall. Crazy stuff happens all the time there so I followed him into there and asked what he was talking about.
“Do you see that?” He asked.
“Do I see what?”
“Those fuckin demons!” I didn't know that he had these hallucinations so I was kind of confused as to what he was getting at.
“Uh… What?” I asked.
“There’s demons crawling all over the ceiling up by the flags and in and out the windows!” He replied. He then looked me right in the eyes and said, “You can’t tell me you’re not seeing this.”
“I’m not seeing this. What the fuck are you talking about?” I replied, getting irritated. I thought he was trying to pull some weird joke on me or something. He then looked at me in the eyes, disappointed.
“I must be tweakin’ then.” He said. He then told me about the Benadryl and how he sees stuff and kind of explained to me. I felt bad for him but there was nothing I could do to help him.
He got expelled about two weeks later for sneaking off campus to steal over the counter drugs and cough syrup from Walmart.",schizophrenia
813,"I worked for someone who i consider one of the smartest persons on the planet. She was tough as nails and always knows what to do. She was brilliant and her father was even smarter.
Back in the late 1990s/early 2000, she purchased a few of weeks at a nice cottage in VT near Lake Champlain for her husband, her child, and her dad. She, her child, and her husband initially stayed near me in Boston at a new warehouse location we were prepping to open in a few days. She wanted meet with old friends at harvard and oversee the set up the warehouse before she headed up to Vermont to be with her dad.
Her father, a nice Japanese professor and retired, flew in from Japan. He was an angler and wanted to go up to the cottage early to fish. I could see from the smile on his face that he was so happy to be with his family in the country. We had a brief conversation about how he was doing to “forget the building in Tokyo and enjoy the country-side of Vermont” and that he loved ben and jerry’s ice cream. (I suggest Dorman’s ice cream in Thomaston, ME was by far better and i promised i would take him there someday.) So she paid for a driver to get him up there and join the family would join him later.
4 day in to her father’s stay, my boss came to me very concerned. She was scared and confused, and wringing her hand very nervously. I followed her into her office to see her husband at her computer. He looked at me, rolled his eyes, got up and left the office. she showed me an email from her father. It was comprised of Japanese/English/and numbers all mix together. It went on forever. She wanted me to confirm the English was gibberish. I read the passages again and again. It made no sense - he was fluent in English, or close to it, so i knew something was really wrong. And what scared me more was she didn’t seem to know what to do. I think that shocked me the most at first.
My boss started to panic. Her father had not responded to phone calls or emails since the last transmission. My boss didn’t know anyone up there, so calling the neighbors was out of the question. The cops couldn’t do anything since he wan’t officially a missing person. She asked if i could to up to lake Champlain with her limited English husband and help. Her husband tried to talk her out of it. He seemed put off a bit at first and mentioned the massive workload we have and limited time to do it. I cut him off, looked at her and said someone has to go NOW - period. I told her something is very wrong and i would go alone if i had to. Her husband looked a little pissed at me but agreed to go with me. He and I hopped in a rental and sped off to Lake Champlain. (I HATE long drives in cars, but it was her and she was someone I admired so much.) I didn’t know how to get there, how long it would take, and a couple bucks in my pocket.
On the ride up, her husband had the normal complaints any husband who has a father-in-law perceived to be a pain in the ass. He kept saying the father was probably drunk and everything would be fine. He talked about how her father was a “genius” who worked with computers in the 1960s thought the 1980s. I had met him a couple of times but our interaction was very limited.
After god knows how long and 200 mile, we arrived at the cabin. It was getting to be nightfall. The lights were on. the front door was wide open. The house was big and beautiful and set near the wood far away from others. I walked into the door and froze. I stared at 2 gnomes her father had obviously place just beyond the threshold of the door. You had to walk around them to enter the house. The gnomes here placed back to back like some Janus figure. The walls in the cabin were covered in handwriting comprised of math and Japanese and English and some other language. It covered almost all the walls, and the house was very big. Her husband just stood there slack-jawed. It was weird and freaked me out. Silence of the Lambs was going through my head, the scene at the end where the agent see the strange and foreboding things in the room. I had worked in the 80s as a counselor for some really messed up people in CT facing jail time and I have seen some really weird and alarming behavior; like the time my team witness one of the first Meth (inhaled) withdrawals, and a guy who dressed up as the queen of England and constanly kept packing and unpacking his 3 peices of clothing for 2 weeks because ""Gobachev was watching and I have to kill and the government…blah blah"" - which I viewed as ""interesting"" thought the myopic lens of clinical work. But what I saw in the cottage this day chilled me to the bone. I felt I was way over my head, with no back up, and in the middle of no-where.
We searched the house and couldn’t find him. I walked out to the back yard. It was dark and I can’t see well in the dark, but I caught something running out of the corner of my eye. It was a naked figure running away from me. the husband and I chased the person down. It was her father. We grabbed each arm and walked him to the car. He was really scared and babbling. the husband said it made no sense. Japanese Gibberish or, ちんぷんかんぷん. (chin pun kan pun or it make no sense what is being said.) I told him we have to get him to a hospital.
I called my boss and told her we needed the location of a hospital nearby. I didn’t know how to get to on,e and mapquest or google maps was not an option at the time. She gave us an address. We got directions from a local at a gas station to the hospital address. I put her father in the back and wrapped him in a blanket. I sat with him in the back. He continued to speak in gibberish (according to her husband.) but i was afraid he would leap out the moving car.
We got him to a nearby hospital. we were all placed in a small room. a doctor came in. the language barrier frustrated all involved. He didn’t know japanese, her father wasn’t responding to english, my japanese was limited and i was scared a shit so i was forgetting things, and her husband had a very limited grasp on the English language. no japanese translators at the hospital at that late hour.
The doctor asked the father a number of questions. Sometimes I would translate, other times it was a tag-team effort of the doctor, me, her husband. Her father wasn’t responding to english. he spoke in half english/ half japanese that made no sense. most of the time, he responded to japanese. he looks so confused and defeated and afraid. the only thing that made sense was her father when he kept saying he wanted to leave.
But he also kept pointing at me and saying in japanese, “look! Can you see it? I know you can see it. Look!” I had no clue what he was talking about. the doctor shook his head and stood up and said, “there is something wrong here, but I can do anything. He is an adult and is refusing treatment.” I went white with fear. the husband look confused when i translated what the doctor said. he didn’t understand why they wouldn’t admit him.
The doctor was about to leave. I asked the doctor to give me a second. one of my degrees is in Psychology. I counseled for five years for the courts in CT and an old trick resurfaced in my memory files from the early 1980s. I called the daughter in boston. I asked her to translate my english to japanese so i could be 100% perfect in the delivery to her father. It was important he understand what i was going ask.
I first sat next to him. I could see he was petrified and confused. I started talk about how we knew each other in japanese and talked about computers and fishing. He seemed to calm down and was talking about how i had a “third eye.” he would point to his forehead. I told him he was safe and I was there to protect him. he would tell his son-law and the doctor in japanese how i was his friend and he liked me. I then started to ask him questions. i would repeat into the phone the english, and the daughter would slowly repeat it back, and i would repeat those words to her father so i was crystal clear in my phrasing.
I asked him 2 important questions. The first was “did you write all that beautiful code on the walls in the cabin?” He replied, “yes. I did it for you.” I then moved the the most important question of the evening, “who told you to do that? why did you do that? Did someone tell you to do that?” He looked confused. I asked him again. He raise his index finger, he pointed to the sky like he just remember something important. “THE GODS,” he said with a big smile and pointed to his forehead. he then went off on a tangent about gods.
I turned to the doctor and said, “he just told me God ordered him to write gibberish on the walls of the cabin.” I explained what i saw in the cabin and offered an image i had taken on an old LG cellphone of the walls. The doctor’s eyes lit up. he asked me to confirm what the father said. I did and sat back down with her father-in-law. I held his hand and kept telling him everything will be fine.
The doctor agreed to admit him. I gave the cellphone to the husband. He asked me what was going on. I explained that the doctored need an excuse to admit him to the hospital, and that talking to God is a sign of metal illness in some cases and that if a person states the can talk to god, there might be a possible physical danger to himself and others, leaving the doctor no choice legally and ethically to admit him to the hospital. it was the only way i could give the doc a reason to admit him. basically, i set her father up and manipulated the reaction/answer. but i felt i had no choice in the matter.
He was admitted and taken care of. the husband wanted to leave, but I told him I had to stay. that he should trust me and joked about the pretty nurses. I stayed and comforted him as long as I could into the late evening.
the daughter apparently didn’t know of his diagnosis. Her father never told anyone most likely out of shame - he was a brilliant computer scientist. She told me, he had initial episodes long ago in japan and was provided with medication that stabilized his bouts. but he never told anyone. he either forgot to take his medication prior to his flight, or stopped when he made it up to the cabin.
Weeks after the incident, her father was back on his meds and in Japan safe and sound. one day, I was in the server room doing my job. My boss came in an shut the door behind her. She gave me a huge hug and thanked me profusely in tears. (PDA is not normal and we were always professional so i was taken a bit.) She kept saying how her father and her husband were amazed at my kindness and how caring and gentle i was to him. she said her father told her i was the reason he was alive and forever grateful she had sent me to him up was there at the cabin.
I told her I appreciated the kind words, but I also told her i would have done it for anyone under such conditions. Her father had looked so scared that day. i just couldn’t let him think he was alone. There was something about him, something behind the illness where he knew he was out of control and helpless. I had seen it before in an institution setting and it has always haunted me. Like a 2nd personality trapped beneath the illness and petrified. (hard to explain. sorry.) i couldn’t imagine anyone going through that. You can see fractures, but sometimes the pain of metal illness is just as bad, and worse when others ignore the unseen pain.
She later gave me a japanese name, Jun 淳. She said it was my character and fit my personality because of the incident.
i never did get to take her father to Dorman’s.",schizophrenia
814,"In the early 1990's I worked for the Dept. of Health and Welfare Chronically Mentally Ill (CMI) division. There are two instances that come to mind.
We had a young woman (mid-20's) who had been battling schizophrenia since her early teens. She was bright, pretty, friendly, active - normal by all appearances when she was compliant with her meds. But as is well-known, many patients will stop taking their meds when they “feel better” - namely because they don't like the way the meds make them feel, and they believe they've got things under control.
When off of her meds, this young lady had severe auditory, and sometimes visual hallucinations. One episode involved her being given instructions by Jesus on different things He wanted her to do. Unfortunately, one instruction was for her to jump onto an empty boxcar of a moving train. She didn't quite make it, and ended up losing one of her legs about mid thigh.
Up-note - the last time I saw her, she had been fitted with a most badass prosthetic leg, was staying compliant on new meds that didn't have nearly as bad side effects, and she was attending nursing school. I lost touch with her over the years. I hope she was able to continue on and have a great life!
The second instance involves the counselor I worked with at CMI. She did not like me from the gate, and did everything she could to make my life miserable. One of her clients happened to be my ex-brother-in-law. He had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, and had been known to be dangerous. For whatever reason, I was a trigger to him. I made his counselor and the director aware of this. The director and I agreed, and informed the counselor, that “John” should not be seen while I was in the office. We had another office on the other side of town and we arranged it so that I could work there when “John” was coming in. We felt that “John” should continue to be seen at the regular office, so as to keep things constant for him.
“John's” counselor knew that I was very frightened by him, and that for whatever reason, seeing me could very possibly trigger an episode for him. His counselor got some kind of sadistic delight out of scheduling him to come in without warning me. How wrong is that?! Not only was she putting me and others in danger, she was purposely putting him at risk. Why would anyone want to do that to someone? Those episodes are horrible for those experiencing them! How sad that her dislike for me would make it ok in her mind to cause suffering for “John”.
Luckily it didn't take long for that counselor to get fired and have her license revoked.",schizophrenia
815,"This is a long story that I will try to keep short. Also, I apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes as I am doing this on my phone.
During my first round of college I decided to enroll in culinary school at my local community college. Being fresh out of high school in a program geared towards those returning to the workforce had its own set of difficulties. Most friends I made were almost ten years older then me, and most had a shady past(drugs, gang life, etc.). Unfortunately those were your peers in 2008 Stockton California, which was on its way to being murder per capita capital of the US as the housing market crashed. There was one or two other students my age, mostly girls, and then there was D. I won’t use his full name for the sake of discretion.
D lived a hard life. Single mother from the ghetto, Brother was the local weed guy on campus, and D just wanted to be normal. D was an odd guy who was more of a goofball then anything else. He had all the swagger of the classic TV nerd, and basically the same personality. He loved having fun, he loved telling jokes, and his E-40 impression was spot on. But D had trouble making friends and most people viewed him as a nerd. Not me, my time spent with D opened my eyes to not judging a book by his cover. Under all that D was a class act party guy. He could drink anyone under the table and wasn’t afraid to get down with some herb. D was by all accounts a fun, if not slightly awkward, guy.
fast forward a year and a half.
We are nearing the end of our schooling. Everything is as it should be. I’m bored at work making personal pizza and sandwiches for the students, breaking the rules to hook them up on extra ingredients without marking their orders, shooting the shit with girls, and sneaking off on my smoke break to smoke something a little more green; A great day to be 20 years old. Soon my friend J, who had the raspiest southern blues man voice you had ever heard, comes in screaming “they got d! They got D!” Now this being “the hood” I figured he meant gang violence. However I was wrong. D got picked up by campus police. I was in shock. Besides a few parties I had never seen D break the law(this was prior to pot legalization in cali).
A few days go by and D is back. Although he let his arrest remain a mystery, most of us assume he got busted with a little pot and spent the night in jail. This was before I knew anything about a 5150 hold, and over the last few weeks D had shown no signs of mental distress, besides saying that he thought someone had shot through his window. His brother claimed to have never heard anything and that no bullet had entered the house. Most of us just brushed this off as where he lived this was not uncommon.
a few more days go by.
Now D is blowing up my phone. I will try my hardest to be true to the convo here, as it was many years ago.
D: we need to talk, Ive done it.
Me: done what exactly?
D: I’ve found the truth, I’ve decoded the Bible and found the true end of the world, St. Peter.
Me: St. Peter, what do you mean.
D: Don’t you understand!!! You are saint Peter, b(another friend, and a story for another day) is Saint Paul, And J is Saint John. I am saint luke and together we will write the new truth.
Me: dude what are you talking about.
D: I’ve spent the last few days deep in study, I have (and this really isn’t a joke) listened to Tupac while reading the Bible. His songs are key, they speak the truth to be read with gods words, and they have told me that the end is coming.
Me: Ok dude, how much of that synthetic weed did you smoke?(a valid question as it was very popular at the time, cheap, legal, and would make you trip balls)
D: it’s not drugs St. Peter, it’s the truth.
and our convo was left at that, at least from what I can remember. D started carrying around a notebook that could best be described as a manifesto/prep guide. It had all his theories along with “science” that would be used to restart humanity. This all came to a point when D went to my house when he knew only my mom was home and started banging on the door telling her to let him in. Luckily he left, but I was fuming. the next day at school I saw him eating and slammed my hand on the table, grabbed his shirt, and told him if he ever did that again he would have to deal with me. Then we didn’t speak again, at least not in person.
As it turns out D was in fact schizophrenic. After his second arrest on campus this was recognized and he was able to get the proper medication. I wish that was the happy ending to this story but as many know, without insurance they give you a months worth of pills and kick you out. From what I understand every month he would run out, have an episode, and end back up on a hold just to get his next months pills. A few months after this I had left to get my bachelors, and did not hear from D for about 8 years.
Luckily not all stories end negatively, after a few years D was able to actually get the help he needed, get a steady supply of medication, and was back at home. I had the fortune of speaking with him over the last year and found out once he got his life back he went on to online school, and is now getting his masters in accounting.
I’d like to say I did something in all of this, but sadly I did not. I was young, ignorant, and selfish. As I continued my studies in psychology my eyes opened, and my heart was filled with regret for the things I could have done for him. I am truly happy he has his life together and will always cheer for him as he accomplishes everything he sets himself out to do. He is a strong man who will do a lot in this world, and society would have told us otherwise at the time.
tldr: Friend from my early college years had a bad episode where he decoded the Bible with Tupac’s lyrics and found the true end of the world. He would be arrested multiple times to get his medication, but is now better and getting a masters in accounting.",schizophrenia
816,"I live in germany and back then, once you were finished with school as a young male, you were conscripted into military service. Alternatively, with ample moral reasoning, you could reject the idea of carrying weapons and “learning to kill” for the fatherland and do a civil service year instead.
Usually this is the time for young people to slack off for a year in a 1-hour a day job and do lots of nothing. However, I wanted to take the opportunity to break outof my comfortable middle class life and experience what life actually can become like if it doesnt go the happy way.
I applied for my civil service year at a mental institution in a ‘closed department’, which meant that this was basically intensive care with all the exteme cases.
Boy was I in for a ride.
There were many disgusting, many sad and some funny stories. Here is what stuck to my mind:
Patient in her late 30s, known schizophrenia. She hadnt been in for a while. She came directly from a regular hospital where she had had a miscarriage. She never realized this, though. She constantly accused staff of stealing her baby. She heard it crying behind doors, even behind the elevator door. She was absolutely heart broken and crying her heart out every day. Definitely the saddest thing I had ever seen. This state lasted for about 6 weeks until the docs got the meds right
Patient in her early 20s, was found somewhere and was not able to remember her name. We ran newspaper ads urging anyone who knew her to come forward. Problem was - she was very sexually active and our patients are not allowed to have relationships with each other because no one can actually consent to anything in this state of mind. She even slipped me her number (politely declined, ofc) and we caught her in bed with other patients frequently. Eventually the meds worked on her and she was able to be released
Elder patient, nearly 80 i think. Came in catatonic, closed-in syndrome. He was in a wheelchair and no threat to anyone, so i took him out frequently. On one of our “walks” I pushed him up a close hill (quite exhausting!) But when we were on top he opened his mouth for the first time in weeks and said “thank you” - for the view, i guess. It was all worth it. He died soon after.. i hope i was able to let him see a little beauty one last time.
Middle aged man, about 40 I suppose. Came in because of aggressive tendencies, so the cops said. He was rather mild mannered and i kinda did not believe it. One day he asked me if he could access his phone in the locker. (They had phones locked up and could only use them under supervision). I said sure lets go. Then right in the middle of it he started having an epileptic episode and spasms and fell to the ground. I had absolutely no idea what was happening and tried to help him get up again - that is totally wrong as i know now, as he was always having schizophrenic/aggressive tendencies afterwards. The moment he came to his senses again he saw me and decided he didnt like my face and would love to do some remodelling thereof. Luckily my colleague saw what was happening and body-slammed him before he took his second swing, so i only got one in the jaw.
Elder women in her 50s who was dead-ass convinced she was harry potter. Sounds funny, but she always tried to touch all the lightbulbs and had second degree burns on her fingers. We had to be on constant watch as to prevent her from harming herself, but the meds worked quite quickly on her and she could be restationed to open therapy after 4 weeks
Young man in his 20s. Took mushrooms, but too many apparently. His trip never seemed to end. Even after weeks and heavy medication the doctors werent able to bring back whoever he once was. Just constantly caged in his own worls and driven by his hallucinations. Or whatever was going on, it was hard to tell. He would react to you, but then quickly drift away again. As if he could not tell what was real and what was just in his mind. Never knew what became of him.
I will spare you the disgusting ones that have to do with odour and bodily fluids.
Anyhow, it was an experience I will never forget. Life can get pretty damn crazy and horrible if you dont take good care of yourself. Or are simply born with the wrong genes.",schizophrenia
817,"My little sister curled up in a ball on my kitchen floor holding her hands on her ears sobbing uncontrollably saying over and over again please make the voices stop.
My sister's boyfriend calling me frantic saying I needed to get over there as fast as I could. Walking through the door to my sister again curled up on the floor with both wrists cut, talking to, stroking and cuddling her hand calling it her youngest daughters name that she had lost custody of.
Then a few years later my sister calling me on the phone asking me to pick her up, she had been hiding in bushes all night because someone was after her, she had deficated and peed on herself.
Then a few months after that staying the night with my sister listening to her keep asking me if I can hear the people in her room she didn't know how they were getting in the house but she could hear them up stairs if she was down stairs and down stairs if she was upstairs. Then waking up to her setting the hallway and bedroom door on fire to burn them out. I had to call 911 that time they found homemade pipe bombs and molotov cocktails she had made to protect her self.
Then when she lost her home and came to live with me, me coming home to her having strangers look through my shed because I was holding women and children prisoner in the walls.
The last one was when she ended her own life that was the saddest of all of them.",schizophrenia
818,"When my son was seven years old he had a group of friends that called themselves “The Group”. Basically, it was a seven-year-old boys club. Fast forward ten years and my son is seventeen when a kid knocks on the front door and starts reminiscing with my son about the “Good Old Days” when they were members of the club.
Over time my son realizes that something isn’t quite right because his friend is talking about things my son can’t see and talking about memories that never happened. My son has a way with people who have disabilities so he doesn’t try to send his friend away and treats him like a part of his current group.
My son moved to Sacramento to live with me and within a few months this boy showed up at the door. The boy often talked about race wars (I think he had been in prison too long over the years. One day he stopped coming by.
The boy’s mother called my son from Canada because she was worried because she had not heard from the boy. A month later my son received a call from the Department of Correction because the boy had given my son's name saying my son was his brother. My son gave the worker the boys’ mother's telephone number. Because the boy held dual citizenship it was decided that he would be transferred to a hospital in Canada because the only facilities for him in the States were prisons.
Everything seemed to be going well for him in Canada as he was even allowed to visit his mother on the weekends. One day he called my son and was going on about race wars and killing people. He told my son that he should purchase a life insurance policy on him because he didn’t think he could hold on much longer.
My son didn’t hear from him for a while, which was not unusual as this boy was always going in and out of his life for long periods at a time. Months later the phone rings and it is this boy. He told my son that he had gone out that last day he spoke to him on the phone, bought a can of gasoline, and lit himself on fire. He told my son that he lost his ears and burnt a large portion of his body. He told my son that ever since then, when he looks at an open flame, he feels his body burning.

819,"#MeToo was doing rounds back in 2017, and as a lot of other women; I had put up a status as well. Just simple #MeToo. Nothing beyond, nothing more. No explanations or stories. Just mere status.
It was a public post, so even the ones who weren’t my friends on Facebook could see the post. A guy I had no idea existed a day before, commented something.
He commented “You Hooker, I will fucking find you and let you know what harassment means” is all. I obviously was naive (than now) and I was enraged at what he commented.
I commented back, looped in a friend who was studying law and the thread went on.
The next morning, I got a message from the same guy saying his account was hacked, it wasn’t him and that he’ll give a public apology. I didn’t buy it.
The next day, he pinged again calling me a slut. I had never met this guy, mind you. Yet he said - I literally should have blocked you after the last time we met.
A week after this drama, I got a call from the parents of the guy who then mentioned that he had schizophrenia, doesn’t know the difference between reality and fiction anymore and would be off Facebook if that’s what it takes for me to not drag it to Cyber Police.
After a long conversation, I decided to move past it. Blocked him everywhere. Though he occasionally did create a fake account here and there and would message random things like “Weren’t you the attention seeker on FB?” But yeah, there’s that.",schizophrenia
820,"It was my dad. My mom was 17 when they married, he was 26. Both from the South. Years later my mom suspected he was that way much earlier than she recognized, due to the strange things he’d say. All kind of things when I was growing up. One was when I was teaching high school. My mom allowed him to stay in the house then, in another set of rooms. They were divorced but she knew he’d fathered 5 children with her, and she didn’t want to stress us children. He had no where to go. Veterans hospitals took him for years, checked him out as being “well”, which he wasn’t, and the cycle would continue. Anyway, during my teaching one day I got a message from the principal that I needed to go to my mom’s house,…”something about your dad”. I went home to find him lying prone on the sidewalk in front of the house. There was a morning fog. I asked, “Dad, what are you doing?” He answered, “Poisonous gas!” (the fog.) I talked to my mom who told me I needed to take him to the Veterans’s Hospital almost 5 hours drive away, so I did. I don’t remember taking him or leaving him; I only remember the call from the high school and my finding him on the driveway. None of my brothers or sister or myself had his paranoia and schizophrenia, and we are in our 60’s now, but we were all worried about it for years! My daughter and I have a possible theory. He was born in 1920, and when he was 2, on the farm, he went behind a mule and was kicked in the head. He went flying. He was in a coma for about 3 days. No hospital then. They all thought he was going to die. Think about it; a swelling brain with no outlet for the pressure. A young, developing brain’s circuitry being scrambled and injured. He had a scar on his forehead from that kick until the day he died. Anyway, I once talked to a psychiatrist about this thought, and he laughed, and said, “I’ve never heard of a case of schizophrenia caused by a kick in the head from a mule!” Well, a month ago I was talking to a make friend who’d been stationed in Germany during the Vietnam war. He made a good friend; let’s call him Mike. My friend went to Texas and visited Mike’s family; even stayed a few weeks. Mike was his close friend for years. Then one day Mike accidentally fell and slammed his head hard on a rock. After that, Mike grew strange and was never nearly the same. He was secretive, evasive, aloof; NOTHING like the old Mike. He was clinically diagnosed as schizophrenic! He never changed after that and cut ties with his family and friends… so opposite the old Mike. So do I think it can happen? Yes, I do. Can I prove it? No. Is it possible I am wrong? Yes. But I think it was a factor with my dad. He didn’t ask for it, but he got it. Both my parents are gone now, and I am grateful that my brothers and sister and I are healthy, happy individuals.",schizophrenia
821,"It is difficult for me to think of “the” saddest thing because for me, the saddest thing about my mother’s schizophrenia was that it left her a shell of a person. It was the culmination of all the psychotic episodes - the delusions, hallucinations, the suicide attempts, the numerous hospital stays……
It is an absolutely horrible illness. At times, the patient is blamed, the family is blamed, the family blames each other. We would never do that with epilepsy or diabetes. If it were called a “neurological” disorder, I wonder if that would help people understand it better.
Years ago, I attended a meeting with a group of adults who had one thing in common: we all had a parent who suffered from schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. A newcomer who was trying to help a family member with schizophrenia visited. He kept using the phrase, “this is an opportunity for me to learn; this is an opportunity…” We finally said, “This is a problem, not an opportunity.” It is a fierce illness. He said, “So, I guess you all have a ‘running down the street naked story’?” We all nodded. I said, “Well, actually MY mother had her slip on.” We all started laughing. I didn’t mean for it to be funny, but it was a welcome relief if only for a few moments.",schizophrenia
822,"I didnt witness the terrible tragedy. Yet, I lived through a dear friend’s schizophrenic brother, age 18 or 19, kill his father while he slept. It devastated all of us. He claimed the “devil told him to end his father's stressful life"" so he shot him while he slept then attempted to kill himself with the same gun. Siblings had to awaken their father because they unknowingly thought he'd merely shot himself but then found their father dead in bed. A tragedy for the family, friends, and the entire community. Three or four years later, I ran into him while shopping. We knew each other since childhood. He seemed well, happy, and productive in his life. Medication is critically important with this condition.. When he shot his father he was not medicated. He rejected taking the critically necessary medication that previously provided relief from “voices"". The voices returned. Then, the horrific event. I've thought of the family often over the years hoping and wishing the best for them all. Its heartbreaking to this day even though the tragedy occurred over 40 years ago.",schizophrenia
823,"Wow, tough to say.
I dated a schizophrenic for 6–9 months.
I’d seen her go on/off meds because she felt better.
She was visiting once from a neighbor stare and ran out of something. My buddy and I drove like bats from hell to find a pharmacy that carried her meds. Even worse, at night through dark suburbs listening her freak out.
She was a cutter, too. When she was over, we hid everything sharp.
When we passed stop signs, she say the government had them wired up to watch us. She was so sincere, it was scary.
She’d pour over the newspaper looking for codes and patterns.

824,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
825,"As a parent of a person with schizophrenia, I would like to dispel the myths. Schizophrenia does not”get worse” as one ages. It SEEMS worse the longer one is unmedicated. Every schizophrenic is different. Medication stabilizes those who respond to it, and for those who don't respond, it is highly likely they are taking the wrong med. Yes, there is a blood test that can tell us which meds are best for that individual. Yes, it is expensive ($700 or so). But it is worth it. Most schizophrenia is NOT like the stories being told here, and it is high time we bust the Hollywood mythology of how schizophrenia presents. Statistically, one in every one hundred people have this condition, and most of them live normal, productive, happy lives. Yes, there are outliers, but for many of those stories they also involve other (non related) tragedies, drug and alcohol abuse (used as coping mechanisms). Do not believe all of these stories. While some may be true, many are total bullshit.",schizophrenia
826,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.

828,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.

Sure it may be a bit hard to handle when they have their psychosis days or their mania days but you just need to understand their boundaries like you would in any normal relationship and know when to treat them when they’re gonna have an episode. Just treat them like they’re human. As a Schizophrenic, I dislike it when people have to treat me as if I have a learning disability or something else.

I’ll say four things:
• Don’t date us if you’re not eager to support our pursuit of recovery;
• Realize there is a difference between people who are striving to get well, and people who are not;
• You can’t force someone to recover if they don’t want to;

832,"Do you want the truth or a polite answer?
The polite answer is: You probably shouldn't date a person with a known psychiatric disorder of any kind. It doesn't make you a bad person if you don't want to add problems to your life, and your first responsibility is to yourself.
The truth: I have been married to a bipolar schizophrenic for over fifty years. She needs to take more medications in a day than I take in a year. Over half of my time is spent taking care of her in one way or another. I need to make sure she eats right, gets out of the house, talks to people instead of avoiding them, and so much else that it is impossible to list them all. My service buddies told me not to date her, one of my supervisors tried to get me transferred before I could marry her, and my mother (a psychiatric nurse) told me I would have trouble for the rest of my life if I continued to see her.
One of the reasons I wasn't promoted while in the military was because of her. (That and the facts that I am stubborn, and so politically incorrect I'm in a class by myself.)
I even retired early so that I could take care of her.
All of that being said, she gives me so much more than I give her that it cannot be overstated. She is smarter than I am (though I have at least double her education), can see through people at a glance, can solve problems correctly in thirty seconds that take me days to come to a conclusion (usually wrong) on, has helped me through some of the worst times of my life without ever asking for anything, has sided with me when the whole world seemed to be against me (even when it would have been in her best interest not to), and is the main reason I want to get up in the morning.
She says “I love you” very infrequently, and yet her saying it means more to me than anything I know. She has been the ONE PERSON I could count on in all those years.
When we are separated, it feels like someone is smothering me with a pillow. When we are together, the world coming to an end wouldn't seem too bad, because she is standing there with me.
Follow your heart and GOOD LUCK to you.",schizophrenia
833,"Trigger warning … stigma against mental illness
No! No! No!
I’m sorry, but hell no!
Let me explain ….
11 years ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and spent almost 3 weeks in the best ‘psych resort’ (also known as a psych hospital) in this city. I know my disorder well from reading and reading everything I could get my hands on, and also from 11 years of experience, living with this, sometimes, debilitating disorder.
I saw this same question on Facebook and most people answered no, just as I did. For some reason the question and answer stayed in my head but I couldn’t figure out why. A couple of days later this thought hit me like a brick wall.
I’m no different than the people who judge me for my mental illness. For the first time in my life I understood the stigma against people like me. It’s like being prejudiced against my own people, my bipolar family. I no longer have any feelings of animosity toward those who judge me. I get it. I understand why they feel the way they do.
There are days when I can’t stand to be myself. There are days when I can do everything but mostly, there are those days when I can’t do a f*****g thing but lay on the couch and watch mindless TV. My mood swings … I hate them and meds help but we all know it’s not a cure all. So, in all fairness, how can I expect someone to be my partner when I can’t even deal with myself?!!
So … HELL NO!! I would never knowingly date someone that has a mental disorder. Prejudiced, you say? Yes, I am. I say this with a heavy heart and shame.",schizophrenia
834,"Im good looking female, Im also popular in my high school, many guys are ready to go on a date with me only if I said yes, but unfortunately, Im schizophrenic, I have no idea how will people react if they found out that I’m schizophrenic…In my country ,, people think that schizophrenics are crazy, violants and psychopaths people , I didnt tell anyone about it except my parents..",schizophrenia
835,"It really depends. Statistically Schizophrenia does not have a high 100% recovery. In society many people with Schizophrenia have lifestyles fraught with other disorders or habit problems such as gambling, drug abuse etc. I would not say that it is impossible to date someone with this particular mental illness but the health of the relationship and the length of it would probably depend strongly on the degree of illness (insight, willingness to continue medication, willingness to work on themselves, effects of medications on the person and so on).
We all have our own reasons for why or why not. Currently living with a family member diagnosed with chronic (for 6 decades of their life) Schizophrenia is enough experience for me to say that I personally Would Not. In my case, said family member is “overly active”, impossible to reason with, derails, gets verbally threatening and highly suspicious of family members and others around them when not on medications. Said person has a history of problematic, self destructive habits, trouble with the law, addictions and failure to comply to regular medications (we had to persuade them to consent to monthly injections recently and have to be careful with what we say around them lest they decide to stop again). Their pride is sky high, they lack insight and when on medications is slow and unable to carry out complex tasks that any regular adult would need in order to sustain themselves, let alone find a job (they are not willing to either even when counselled). This person has always lived in their own world with very brief moments of clarity regarding their issues which quickly fades back into thoughtlessness. Even with full access to healthcare and help, there is no progress made and this person just lives from day to day under family care (and we are lucky that the family has the finances to support them, not everyone does!). Over the years, managing them has been a constant roller coaster of being stable and being out of control. It really is stressful, sad and it really is not easy. Sadly as well, the reality is that many people with Schizophrenia are just not at a level of cognizance that would be able to sustain a relationship or a livelihood and the people who do manage them (such as family members, children or spouses) can often suffer their own mental / emotional abuse or become abusive too.
It certainly is not impossible. I am sure that there are those who have a better prognosis overall and thus are better able to live as what we deem are fully “functional” human beings. I also don’t mean to discourage people who are already in relationships, trying hard to get better or are hoping to start a relationship with someone with this mental illness. The take home message here is that as an individual, as with everything else in life, consider the facts, consider what you have in front of you (your knowledge, capabilities, willingness to help and do what it takes to make things work and where your partner stands), think carefully before making your decision. Some results of said decision may be irreversible and may affect more lives than just the two (or more) of you.",schizophrenia
836,"As someone with an actual psychotic disorder. I find most of the answers here disgusting and ignorant. A psychotic person who is on meds and treatment is mostly the same as a normal person.

But show me that I can actually trust you and I will do my best to not let my Bipolar psychosis be a burden and stick with treatment. I may be moody at times due to circumstances out of my control. But I would try my best to make the relationship work as everyone has their own quirks.
Psychosis manifests itself in many different ways for each person. I personally am a paranoid, delusional Bipolar. But if I were in a relationship I would be open to the problems my partner had and try my best to fix or at least mitigate them.

When medicated, it is all controlled really well, with the occasional anxiety or panic attack. Without medication, he has auditory hallucinations and is a very bitter, depressed, and anxious person. Recently, due to a change of physicians and insurance, he was forced to go without his meds for a few months. Life with him during those few months was very unpredictable. He was never a danger or threat to us, but he disassociated himself from the outside world. Some days he would stay in bed all day, other days he would be so hyperfocused on an activity that nothing could tear him away. It broke my heart to see him hurting so much, to see him having a constant battle with his brain. But, not once did I even consider leaving him. He is still the same strong, loving, dedicated, intelligent man that I fell in love with, whether on or off of his medication. Relationships require work and dedication. I was well aware of what I was getting into when we started dating and when I made the promise to marry him. Of course there will be challenges, but what is life without some sort of challenge? He is the love of my life, my best friend, and if I would have dismissed him due to his mental illness, I would've never known the happiness and love that he has brought to my life.

Another couple that has been together roughly 30 years. He was almost normalish when I was little. Now he is basically zombie. The meds have turned him into a passive, emotionless person. He is in an almost childlike state most of the time. I have seen him get “irritated once” and seen him do strong things that make no sense a few times.

A former high school teacher of my brother even stopped taking her meds and killed her own seven year old son because of this.

841,"I wouldn’t do it… Some relationships have a relatively higher probability of success, and others have a relatively higher probability of failure. Relationdhips with Schizophrenics fall into the category of having a higher probability of failure.
No relationships are guaranteed success, but I believe it is worth increasing your probability if you can. This does NOT mean that a relationship with a schizophrenic can’t work…only that the diagnosis carries a higher than average risk of problems. If you happen to love someone who is schizophrenic, it’s up to you if you want to date them, but the diagnosis won’t help your relationship.
The other question is the motivation for wanting to enter the relationship. You need to consider if you really want them to be your dating partner or your patient. The motivation really should be because you genuinely love the person…and you should recognize and accept that they will end up being more like a patient…and it puts both you and them in a less than ideal situation.",schizophrenia

844,"Thanks for the A2A <3
As for the question, yes and no.
Would I? Well, I have in the past. I spoke more on this here:
Emilie Morgan's answer to If your significant other told you they were schizophrenic, how would you handle your situation? Every time I get close enough to someone to let my diagnosis surface, they treat me differently. Is it the people I surround myself with, or is it me?
I am thankful I dated someone who was psychotic, it helped very much when I was diagnosed because I remembered that if he could be accepted to university, live on campus, thrive, ect. I could too. It added less weight to the diagnosis, and if I hadn’t have dated him, such a large diagnosis as schizoaffective disorder when I was only 16 probably would have sent me into a depression.
Dating someone with psychosis can be a challenge at time, but they are regular people. Psychosis affects around 3 in 100 people, which means it is a fairly common disorder. Psychotic people can be doctors, lawyers, business owners. Just because someone is psychotic does not mean they are an unlovable monster that must be locked away from society in a psych ward. With medication, psychosis can be manageable, and it can even go away entirely.
But, would I, personally, date someone with psychosis again? Probably not. This is not because they have psychosis, it’s more for my own good. When I dated someone with psychosis, we would tell each other about our delusions, which would make the other party more paranoid than before. Our psychotic disorders would feed off of each other. However, keep in mind at the time I was not diagnosed yet, but he was.
Right now, I would not date someone with psychosis. I need to focus on my studies. I need to make sure my schizoaffective disorder stays at bay. Adding paranoia that people are reading my mind would not mix well with being a first year college student about to move into her first dorm. I need someone in my life that is very strict with me staying on my meds. I need someone who brings me back down to reality when I start fading away. I need someone who has tons of energy to help me not lay in bed all day if times are getting a bit rough. My current boyfriend, a very logical thinker who has so much energy I need to go on ten mile walks with him each night to wear him out for bed, is perfect for me right now!",schizophrenia
845,"I find this question very hard to answer, but, I will try. On a personal level I would have to say that I would rather not. This is only because I have borderline personality disorder and I think it would be extremely difficult to make things run on an even keel. I imagine it would be a disaster for both of us. On the other hand, if I did not have a disorder I would consider it only if the person was on, and agreed to stay on, their medication. An untreated schizophrenic would be impossible to have a normal relationship with. I do not mean to belittle or insult ANYONE with this answer. It is Only MY OPINION.",schizophrenia
846,"The only man I’ve ever truly loved, and still love, is schizophrenic. We dated for several months. He never told me he was schizophrenic until I flat out asked him, and I felt bad that he thought he had to hide it from me.
He was the sweetest, kindest, most sincere man I’ve ever been with (at times). But after his doctor took him off his medication he started having ups and downs.
There were times when I felt like I was with a different person, as he would completely withdraw and want nothing to do with me and after 3 months of being together he told me he had to “detach” from me, something that deeply hurt to hear and I didn’t understand at the time because back then I knew nothing about schizophrenia.
He would come and go and we were on and off for seven months.
Without going into great detail I can tell you if you are dating someone with schizophrenia please read as much as you can about it, otherwise you will both get frustrated because you will expect things from him (or her) that at times he/she may not be capable of (emotionally), things that you could have understood if you did your research. In return, he will get frustrated because of your confusion or pushing for more than he can give.
If I could go back in time I’d tell myself that the following things are very important when dating a schizophrenic:
1). There will be good days and bad days, or spans of good weeks then bad weeks - by this I mean he (or she) might withdraw affection from you, not remember things you’ve talked about or done together, have a overall different attitude and demeanor towards you, at times even treating you like a stranger
2). Be patient, understanding, and don’t take it personally.
If he/she can’t remember something and/or is acting differently towards you - it can feel like dating two different people (one that’s close to you emotionally and another that doesn’t trust you or show you affection)
3). Give him/her space! If they want to withdraw and ask for space, it is crucial you respect their request. If you don’t give them space, you will absolutely loose them.
4). Don’t push for affection - at times he/she will recoil at a mere touch and at other times they will initiate affection. My ex one week starting telling me that me being affectionate only made him feel guilty because he couldn’t reciprocate. For me, my ex did this on and off, but unfortunately as time went on his lack of affection only grew - likely because I didn’t understand it was his disorder, got frustrated, and was pushing for affection.
4). Paranoia - there will be certain things he/she is paranoid about. Don’t ever be judgmental of this, it is out of his/her control.
There is so much more I could cover, but these are just a few things to know when dating someone with schizophrenia.
Sadly, I did everything wrong and pushed for affection and I didn’t understand why at times he was like two different people. Keep in mind I didn’t find out he was schizophrenic until a few months after we had been dating. I should have read about schizophrenia and I could have done so many things differently and because I didn’t I lost the love of my life. Patience and space is vital for a successful relationship. He has come and gone out of my life multiple times, I hope someday he’ll come back, but I know there will always be ups and downs and that is something you have to be able to accept when dating a schizophrenic person.",schizophrenia
847,"I already did. He had PTSD. It would be more legitimate to say that I “borrowed” him as he was not officially mine. He had emotional trauma that still affected him on a subconscious level that in retrospect seemed more obvious than when I was with him.
He admitted to me that he was molested by a babysitter that took advantage of his appearing older than his age at about 11 years old. He admitted to an uncle that used him sexually to ”get off” while this said uncle viewed pornagraphic magazines. He admitted to experiencing racism while fighting as a Marine during the Gulf War. He admitted to wanting to commit suicide in the form of walking out into a firing raid during an attack in the Gulf War. He admitted to inadvertently killing children during an event that was by no means intentional while following the orders of a mission.
Interestingly enough, despite all this he was (and still is) a wonderful human being. He didn’t allow his past experiences to define him or limit his potential in life. He continued on to raise a handsome and intelligent child and has gained financial freedom to his and his family’s benefit.
Alternatively, I briefly dated a person who was low-key narcissistic and someone else who appeared somewhat autistic. I’m especially grateful that the former was cut short before a marriage or children could ensue.
Now, if I had to repeat that experience with someone else, I would be more mindful of the individual than to completely write him off. I think a lot of people today are along some level of a mental health challenge/compromise spectrum than they are willing to admit or at least acknowledge within themselves.",schizophrenia
848,"Would I date someone suffering from a mental illness? I have, and I married her.
I think this question sort of draws an artificial line between people who suffer from a “mental illness” and those who don’t. Really we are all on a spectrum, just like sexuality, where there are extremes but the middle is somewhat blurry. In the case of extremes, someone may be so tightly wound up in their psychotic state that difficulties are insurmountable, but these are the exceptions rather than the rule.
For example, we all suffer from depression at some level sometimes but does it mean we are are all mentally ill at those times? Well, yes, to an extent. Only a psychiatrist can put the label on us, and the diagnosis can be inaccurate or downright wrong sometimes. Second opinions are always available.
I was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder many years ago, but did it destroy my ability to relate to “normies”, communicate with other people well and have healthy relationships? No. I was prescribed medication and found a therapist who helped me understand mood swings in general, not in a clinical way but more in a spiritual sense. I learned how to stop self-medicating and meet these rather extreme emotional onslaughts with self-compassion and understanding which, with some medication, allowed me to live a “normal” life.
So there I was, “mentally ill” and dating another person who was also mentally ill. (She had been diagnosed with chronic anxiety and depression.) Sounds like a recipe for disaster at first glance, right? We discussed these problems early on in the relationship and were able to see that we both were in the same leaky boat and share what we had both learned from our experiences. It was really just like any other relationship in that there are always bumps along the way and it requires patience, communication and courage to make it work.
People are unique in their individuality but their main predicaments can be almost exactly the same. I have trouble drawing this mental “line” between health and illness. It is entirely possible for anyone to get through just about anything and come out wiser and stronger. For two people who find they have much in common and are drawn together it just takes the same relationship skills that are needed in any other such situation.",schizophrenia
849,"I am not sure if I would.I never know if I am going to fall in love with someone like that,but if I did,I think the whole relationship would feel like I am there to heal them.",schizophrenia
850,"first of all, you are not your illness.
i was in a relationship with this guy i loved so much, and not even once, it occurs to my mind that he is the “schizophrenic” one, when im thinking of him.
even back then, whenever i thought of him, the first things that came to my mind was how brilliant,loving, and adorable he is.
the way he laughed,his eyes,his smiles,and every single detail about him that made me fall for him in the first place.
the love i felt for him was the thing that made him different with others, not the illness he was suffering from.
that being said, his illness was not something as simple as an occasional flu.
ever since i was a kid, developing schizophrenia was my biggest fear.even the idea itself would give me a nightmare.i recall watching a documentary when i was seven,and that was the age i became obssesed with that disease.i avoided looking at myself in the mirrors, cause i was scared to see someone thats not me!
anyway, years later i fell in love with the nicest guy ever, and that was when i realized that if there is something worse than having a serious mental disease,it would be watching one of your loved ones struggling with it.
there were times when he had a psychotic episode, and he wouldnt recognize who i am.he looked me in the eyes,and the numbness would make me freeze.
sometimes he felt so paranoide that im not me, that im a duplicate of myself or a delusion.
he would hallucinate that he had killed me or his family, and there is blood on his hands that wont go away no matter how many times he washed them.he actually smelled the blood, that would cause him nausea and blackouts. sometimes he started crying so hard, that nothing would calm him down.
and many many other things, it was all so hard to watch. so hard.
literally the hardest thing ever.
and he would beg me to leave , saying that i deserve a better life, he felt so guilty for all the stuff we were going through at that time.but as i said, he was not his illness and neither are you.
he was the most amazing person i have ever met,and i’ll ever will.he was the “once in a life time” kind of guy, and having him in mylife was definitely worth ANY hardship to go through.
so im not going to lie, it was hard. it was so damn hard watching him suffer like this.
and schizophrenia,the disease itself, is still the nightmare.
but struggling with that doesnt make you any less worthy of experiencing things such as great love or unforgettable relationships in your life.
it all depends on who, yourself, are.
and the one who deserves you, would already know that.
i hope it helped, sorry for the grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

851,"I've been the mentally ill child that my friends' parents forced me to stop being friends with… Let me share my experience. I had a best friend for YEARS (I'm talking preschool through middle school, we spent just about every minute together). this girl was everything to me. She was the only person at school who didn't treat me any differently despite me clearly not being a normal child. Then one day, I told her that I had been seeing a therapist for autism and borderline personality disorder, and she told her mom because she wanted to know how she could help. Instead, her mother heard “personality disorder” and freaked out, banning her from ever speaking to me again. We're both adults now, and we're friends again since her mother can't control her anymore, but the pain and the emotional damage that came with losing the only person my age that I trusted has impacted me forever. I still can't make new friends to this day because I'm convinced that they're going to find out that I have mental illnesses and abandon me.
My point is, if this girl is good friends with your daughter, then this no-contact bullshit will RUIN this girl’s life. Your daughter is a piece of this girl's support system, and you are robbing her of that. A support system is the single most important part of treatment for mental illnesses, even more important than medications. Imagine being in a very dark place in your life and needing a friend you can rely on, and then suddenly that friend isn't allowed to have anything to do with you… How would you feel? Alone? Abandoned? Scared? Confused? I'll tell you what I felt. “Why can't I have friends? Why doesn't anyone want me anymore? Why are people suddenly treating me like a freak? I should just kill myself, I don't want to live if I'm going to be alone.”
Having a mental illness does not make someone a monster. It does not automatically make someone bad, or scary, or dangerous. What makes someone with mental illnesses bad, or scary, or dangerous, is a lack of understanding and support. The stigma behind schizophrenia is astronomical, and a lot of it isn't even true for most cases. Maybe instead of judging this girl because of a label she's been given, actually get to know her. And if you already know her, then her diagnosis doesn't mean a thing. She is still the exact same person you know, she's just got a highly stigmatized label attached to her now.",schizophrenia
852,"A diagnosis ISN’T a reason for shunning someone with a mental illness but a time to support her. IF the girl is taking her medication and seeing a therapist, she should be relatively stable, although sometimes this process takes a few weeks to a few months, maybe longer if the doctor has difficulty in finding the right medication/dosage.
Invite her for supervised gatherings, family dinners, movie nights, trips to Disneyland, Zoom chats where you’re in the room/whatever, so you can get a feel for how the girl is acting and treating your daughter. Talk to your daughter about being supportive but also about kind (but firm) boundary setting if her friend is out of hand in any way. If the girl seems to be doing well, allow them to do some normal teen things together unsupervised.
Most of all, keep an open line of communication with your daughter, so she feels she can come to you if she has concerns, rather than having to hide them for fear of your reaction.
In general, it’s important to talk to teens about not keeping their friends’ secrets if their friends are doing something harmful to themselves and/or others. Role-play situations that you see on television or in the newspaper. “What did you think about how X handled that situation?” “What would you have done differently?” “How about if you said or did X instead?” “How might doing/saying X have made the situation better/worse?”
When parenting a teen, some good questions are, “How did you feel/what did you think when she said/did…?” “What do you think you/we should do about this?” So instead of TELLING your daughter what to do, ASK her. “I’m concerned that some of your friend’s behavior might hurt you/drag you into trouble/make you stressed. Do you have any of those (or other) concerns?” “I can understand that you want to be friends, and I admire what a loyal person you are. What might be some ways to support your friend and still keep you safe/unhurt/not stressed?”
Sometimes when asking your child or teen what to do (including punishments) he or she might come up with really creative solutions that you haven’t thought of. Or maybe a stricter penalty than you would have imposed. Teens are far more likely to follow guidelines if they’ve been part of setting them up.
In the end, for your daughter’s own well-being, she might have to give up a friend who’s acting out in hurtful or inappropriate ways. Instead of telling her to do so, coach her in coming to that conclusion on her own. Also coach her in how to best tell her friend why she is withdrawing from the friendship. “It’s not that you have schizophrenia, it’s because you aren’t taking your medication, and you are saying or doing X. I care about you and wish you well. However, I can’t allow myself to be treated that way. That’s not healthy for either one of us.”
If at some point, your daughter is unable to withdraw from an unhealthy relationship, then you will have to step in. “Sweetie, you cry every time you get off the phone with her. We’ve talked about your struggles to be honest with her about how you feel and you can’t speak up. Therefore, for your well-being, I’m going to have to step in and say you can’t be friends. We tried. We’ve discussed the situation. Things aren’t getting better. We’re done.”
IF the problem is your daughter’s inability to speak up for herself or set boundaries, and she begs for one more chance to be stronger, give it to her, but stay in the room or on the phone/Zoom chat to hear how it goes and so you can do a post-conversation coaching session.
All the best,

853,I married a schizophrenic and I find this question to be down right rude! You're daughter has been friends with this girl for how long and now because of her diagnosis you're going to ostracize her further?! She's probably distraught and already feeling separated from the world and you're going to further break this girls support system and make her out to be a monster?,schizophrenia
854,I wept reading this question. I've battled depression and anxiety all my life(I'm 66). I have very few friends because no one understands. We don't choose to have a mental illness but because it isn't understood people back away. As lonely as I am I cannot fathom the feelings of this young woman and her family. Have compassion and treat her with value and respect. Remember she is probably terrified and taking away her friend is quite frankly beyond cruel. Mental illness is enough of a struggle without the stigma. Be kind.,schizophrenia
855,"Q: My 16 y/o daughter’s friend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Am I wrong for prohibiting her from being in contact with us anymore?
So, you know someone who was diagnosed with a mental illness. What that means is the person has the mental illness, went to a doctor and found out what the problem was. They didn’t go to the doctor and all of a sudden end up having schizophrenia. She’s still the same person, diagnosis or no diagnosis. The only difference having a diagnosis makes is she now knows - and you do too - why she’s a bit different from other people. Her difference isn’t a result of the diagnosis.
Also, by prohibiting your daughter from seeing her friend, you are increasing the stigma around mental illness. Most mentally ill people aren’t dangerous and they’re not contagious illnesses either. All you’re doing by keeping your daughter from her friend is ostracising the friend, and if everyone did that, then she would be incredibly lonely. How would you feel if that was your daughter? How would you feel if she had the mental illness and everyone who was once friends with her stopped talking to her all of a sudden? No one helps anything by not talking to people just because there’s something different about them.",schizophrenia
856,"DISCLAIMER: This answer is not intended to be diagnosis, counseling or therapy. It is a general discussion of mental health issues with a referral.
I am hoping this question is not genuine, and perhaps designed to promote shock. A young person’s diagnosis with schizophrenia or any other mental illness should not result in shunning. (I might make an exception for untreated addiction, if there is a chance their behavior is influencing their peers, or for conduct disorders, if engaging in ongoing dangerous and destructive behavior.)
I don’t know how you got the information about her diagnosis? It would not be unusual for the neighborhood rumor mills to garble the exact diagnosis. But nevertheless, if it is schizophrenia, schizophrenia doesn’t make a person evil, dangerous or criminal. While occasionally one does hear about someone with a diagnosis of schizophrenia doing something violent, that is rare. Some of the things that are more likely to happen with a young person with schizophrenia is for them to withdraw, appear flat in their emotions, neglect to care for their physical needs, and to have a decline in academic abilities. If there has been a diagnosis of schizophrenia, she is likely to be on medication and some of those symptoms will probably lessen. There may be side effects from the medicine, which may be uncomfortable for your daughter’s friend. If your daughter’s friend has not shown behaviors that endanger others so far, then likely she is among the majority of those with schizophrenia who are completely harmless to others. In fact, people with schizophrenia are likely to be victimized by others, so all the more reason for them to have supportive friendships.
If this teen is responding to medicine and getting other needed support to manage the illness, your daughter’s continued friendship would be another source of strength in her recovery or management of the illness.
The prognosis of schizophrenia varies. In about a 25% of the cases, with treatment, it appears to go into a sort of remission and the sufferer lives a normal life. [1] Also be aware, should this be a case of garbled communication, there are other psychotic disorders that young people experience briefly, which resolve completely.
If your daughter doesn’t want to see her friend anymore, and that’s why you have shut her out, that’s different. At that age, it may be too overwhelming for her. But if your decision is based on some kind of fear, the best thing for the friend and your family is to get educated about what is really going on. Consider learning about mental health or going to support groups for friends and relatives of those who suffer through NAMI—Here is the link:[2]

[2] Teens & Young Adults | NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness",schizophrenia
857,"Being 100% honest yes you are very very wrong for that. People who have schizophrenia, bipolar, bpd..other serious mental health problems are not likely crazy or evil or dangerous. You see this label as a problem for what reason? It makes you uncomfortable, you are adding to the stigma and disregard of mental health. People with mental illnesses can be some of the most loyal, empathetic, and genuine humans I’ve met. I am a therapist as well as diagnosed with mental illnesses, from personal experience it is terrible to be viewed as a monster or different due to something you can’t control. If you are that against the idea of your daughter being her friend I’d ask yourself why? If you or another adult is supervising their hanging out there should be no issue with it. Your daughter clearly views this person as a friend for a reason. Maybe try asking her the positive traits she admires of her instead of choosing to view some label to completely throw her out of your child’s life. Would you let her be friends with someone who has cancer or another physical illness? I’d assume yes. So think deeply as to why it is a problem for you :)",schizophrenia
858,"16 is on the young side, for schizophrenia. Not unheard-of, young, but a little unusual. Now, bipolar disorder, you could see starting to show up for people, although there are a lot of years left where it could still normatively make an appearance—and depression, I promise, has arrived in at least some of her peers’ lives, years ago, by now. But for a thing like schizophrenia… your daughter won’t be in the (statistically likeliest but still non-absolute) clear, for like… as many years as she’s been alive, so far.
So, what you might want to get really serious with yourself about is: what on earth are you going to say to your daughter, if she ends up with a major mental health diagnosis, after this?
And perhaps even more importantly—what and how much do you expect she’s likely to say to you, if she notices any kind of mental health symptom of her own, while she remains under your care? And if not—if she needs a mental health assessment, or crisis care, or therapy or meds, as a young adult, do you think she’ll seek them? Or will she avoid the help she needs, because she’s afraid that if she gets it, you’ll also decide that it’s best to stay clear of her?
Or do you think she’ll be likelier to find her own way, get the help she needs, and cut you out of her life, on the assumption that you’ll just do the same, if you ever find out?
Cutting your daughter off from her friend hurts them both, in the here and now, in a way that sounds pretty profoundly unfair, and not grounded in any actual risk to your daughter’s well-being. More than just that, though—it sets your daughter up to believe, rightly or wrongly, that if she ever needs serious mental healthcare? She better take a pass, hide it from you, or maybe just count on ending her relationship with you, altogether. Is that really the message you want to send your 16-year-old?",schizophrenia
859,"No, in the best interest of the friend, she shouldn't be in contact with people like you who even consider it to be Ok to reject a person on the basis of them having an illness.
This friend is I assume also still a child, a child who is struggling and who needs friends and support, the last thing this child needs is to ostracized and treated with cold hearted rejection.
I hope this friend does stay away from you and any other toxic people.
And I hope your daughter doesn't respect your decision to ban her friend, it would really be sad if your daughter learned from you how to treat people.
Consider this: How is your daughter supposed to trust you enough to come to you if/when she starts having problems, knowing this is how you treat people who are struggling with mental health problems..?",schizophrenia
860,So unfortunate that you feel this way. My daughter had schizophrenia and people called her weird and she lost her friends. Eventually she committed suicide as she told me her pain was unbearable. She had no friends because of people like you. I feel sorry for you that you have no compassion for the mentally ill. It is not their fault. It is a chemical disorder in the brain and can happen to any of us.,schizophrenia
861,I’m seriously baffled at the lack of self-awareness I see in these types of questions. Of course you’re wrong. Your daughter’s friend is dealing with a horrifically isolating disorder and you’re now ostracizing her from a friend solely because of that disorder. Have you ever read about schizophrenia? My mom has dealt with psychosis-induced schizophrenic episodes and it is the HARDEST thing to watch someone endure. Now you’re taking away a friend of this girl because you don’t like her disorder? Shame on you. Seriously.,schizophrenia
862,"I am schizoaffective, and I'm tired of people assuming I'm dangerous when they find out my disorder. My fiancee's mom won't be at our wedding because she hates me. I only met her once, and she refused to talk to me all day based solely on she decided she didn't like me because of what she found out I have. She's been spreading rumors to others in his family that he's with a dangerous woman that will hurt him one day, possibly kill him. Obviously people who assume such things don't take the time to truly educate themselves. It's wrong to push people away only because you know they have a certain disorder.",schizophrenia
863,"Just ask yourself if your daughter was diagnosed with schizophrenia or really actually any other mental illness would you want her friends to be prohibited from seeing her?
Unless there's been an incident that worries you about your child's safety. You are 💯 teaching your child that people with mental illnesses have a disability and are disadvantaged of living a “normal” life in your life. Your building a lil human to look at disabilities as not okay and looked at in a negative way.",schizophrenia
864,It must have been very extremely hurtful for your daughter’s friend to be judged and ostracised by adults who should know better and even more hurtful and detrimental to her that these adults are her friend’s parents.,schizophrenia
865,"My mother is schizophrenic. I want to share my story.
Life had been difficult and it is still now. In my childhood, I've seen people treated me differently. People would mock about my mother. My adolescent mind would get hurt badly. I wondered why my mother acts so strange. It always felt like I never knew her. As a person what is she? what she likes or dislikes. I've seen other women doing makeup, dressing well. But I've never seen my mother that way. I wondered how she looks like when she dresses well. Later I found some old photographs of her when illness didn't yet attack her. I saw an woman in those photographs who is so beautiful. Her eyes on those photographs looked so charming and happy. Will I ever be able to know that person?
I've seen my mother rebuking my father without any apparent reason. She is in her delusions, a kind of false perception of reality. Its hard to connect with such kind of person. Even hard to love. But I've seen my father loved her unconditionally and without any complain, she is the woman of our family.
Yes, family life was a total mess with mommy can't do her co-ordination properly. People would generally avoid visiting our home. My mother didn't tolerate other people to come to our home. Her delusions would get kicked on those moments. She thought, those people coming to our home are her enemy. We became socially isolated. It was hard to maintain social life. Well-wishers found it difficult to help us. People would have happy family days on festivals, we would have nothing left. I've passed so many gloomy days.
In the beginning of her illness, there were so many superstitious speculations. My grandmother thought, some evil spirit had possessed her daughter. She tried every kind exorcism to evict the spirit. It was all horrible to watch those rituals. As expected, all gone in vain. Later my mother was hospitalized as a mental patient. The correct treatment started there. Since then she is under prescribed medication. It will continue throughout her life.
It's hard to live with a schizophrenic person. It's not hundred percent curable. Constant care and continuous medication is necessary. Someone near him/her must act as a 24/7 caregiver. An immense stress which sometimes makes life harder.",schizophrenia
866,"Let’s be realistic. It can be dangerous. If the person is not getting adequate treatment, he may, some day, in some way, hurt you, in the midst of a worsening of symptoms. Symptoms do get worse over time(over months, years), if not treated. And symptoms can simply be worse on some random day. The severity of symptoms and how symptoms may change, is difficult to predict.
He may shove you, yell at you. People have been hurt, even killed. Unfortunately that is true. These things do happen.
Do they happen a LOT? All the time? Are people with schizophrenia categorically dangerous? No. Not really.
But yes, hostility and violence may occur with schizophrenia.
Usually, there are lots of warning signs. The person will make statements that seem hostile or threaten violence. The person may harm himself or talk of suicide. The person may seem very tense and angry, he may grimace tensely. His body language may seem threatening. Alcohol or substance abuse increases the risk of violence. Severe paranoia increases the risk of violence. The person getting command hallucinations (usually, voices insisting he must do something) increases the risk of violence.
So yes it’s possible.
It’s not something I worry about constantly, though. Safety should always be sort of automatic - don’t box the person in or argue with him. Keep things calm and cool, don’t react angrily if the person say something odd or even threatening.
If a person is off medication and obviously getting very severe symptoms, it may be a good idea to give the person lots of room. You may need to leave the person alone. It’s a very difficult risk because the person could hurt you or himself. And quite often the police won’t take the person to a hospital. And often family can’t get the person to go.
So families wind up just having to somehow cope with a person having a severe psychotic episode.
Don’t argue with him or put any pressure on him. Give him a lot of room. Don’t box him in or prevent him from leaving a room or area.
I’m not even coming close to claiming these measures will ALWAYS prevent anyone from getting hurt. They might help. If a person is severely psychotic the only thing that will help is hospitalization and medication. And local mobile crisis or police may refuse to hospitalize him.
One other thing worth emphasizing: there is no point in getting angry at the person, either during or after. I feel quite sure the person is in an ‘altered reality’ and would not be causing trouble were he not psychotic. It gets to a point where it isn’t realistically controllable by that individual.",schizophrenia
867,"Yes.
You are teaching your kid(s) some pretty telling lessons right now. Like you should judge people. Like you should cast them out of your life, even if you’ve known them awhile (which it sounds like that is the case here) and they’ve done nothing wrong. They just made the grave mistake of thinking they could trust your family with the - I would assume - very upsetting news that they have been diagnosed with a serious psychiatric illness.
And I have to assume the “psychiatric illness” aspect of this is what is bothering you; I doubt you’d be reacting the same way if this kid said she’d been diagnosed with leukaemia.
You know, your kid could also turn out to have schizophrenia, or another psychiatric illness. What will you do then? Are you still allowing the depressives to visit?
I would advise you to watch this film trailer for Words on Bathroom Walls. I’m friends with a few people with schizophrenia, they said it doesn’t look exactly accurate, but it does seem to portray the emotional response as a young adult to this particular illness - and the way people ostracise those who have it.
Mental illness of any type is incredibly isolating and terrifying, and carries with it huge social stigmas (that you are enforcing with this post and your behaviour, BTW.)
While your attitude is… less than lovely, I’m acutely aware that it is at least part the result of literally decades of Western media portraying the mentally ill in general, and schizophrenics in particular as dangerous and erratic[1] . The latter can be true, of some people with schizophrenia on a bad day, but the former seems to be the opposite of true.
For example: “Persons with schizophrenia are undoubtedly at increased risk of becoming victims of violence in the community setting, with risks up to 14 times the rate of being victimised compared with being arrested as a perpetrator” - Violence and Schizophrenia
It is true that violence or erratic behaviour is still a risk - but life in general and parenting in particular is a series of calculated risks. Your kid could bring home a “normal” friend who takes the wrong cocktail of drugs on the wrong day and burns your house down. That’s just life on this planet, friend.
The best news, for both you and this kid, is she doesn’t live with you. Your home is just a place for her to socialise with your daughter - or was, before you made this wrong-headed and discriminatory decision.
Schizophrenia is largely dictated by genetics - as such, it is not this person’s fault. She just got… unlucky. I know the feeling, at least to an extent. I’ve been disabled since age 12, due to a host of illnesses, some of which may have genetic causes - and need a wheelchair to get around.
Would I be unwelcome in your home?
What makes me different than the kid you’ve just banned from your household?
You’ve got quite a lot of thinking to do, and some apologies to make.

870,"Not sure why you’d do this now. Schizophrenia isn’t contagious. Either the friend behaves him or herself in an appropriate manner, or not; either way, the diagnosis doesn’t matter. There’s a law professor at USC who has schizophrenia, and there’s a gifted jazz composer/trumpet player who does too. No more reason to “prohibit” your daughter’s friend from contacting her than there is to suddenly “prohibit” a diabetic, or a blind person, from contacting your daughter.

872,"I want to answer your question. I really do. Unfortunately, though, I'll only be able to assist in a manner of telling you what it's like to live with others who aren't mentally ill; while being mentally ill.
I'm Schizoaffective. The people I live with have no prior diagnosis.

I walked into the kitchen today commenting on a smell of ""vomit."" It was a horrible smell. Confronted with confused looks, I was assured there was no smell resembling vomit.
I've also been assured there is no ""real"" voice that resides in my head; that the euphoria I chase is synthetic; that the ""Blue man with a top hat and a cane"" is nothing more than a hallucination...
What's interesting, friend, is that these things are real to me; to us. Individuals who live with those alive with fiction (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, etc.) have a severe disadvantage when it comes to handling everyday life.
I've watched those I care for dearly cry when I'm in a psychotic state, furiously mumbling about the truths of life and valleys in my mind; because there's nothing they can say or do.
I've felt the painful sting of realizing how much time, money and energy has gone into, well, ""handling"" me. I've also felt and seen embarrassment when my delusions are made public.
It's like walking on needles in regard to acting ""normal."" I can only imagine how hard it is to make those surreal, if I may, times part of your everyday life.
It's damn hard living. Attempting to find a balance out of pure (at times) chaos, and living in harmony, is near-impossible as the illness, especially those of a Schizo nature, is ruthless.",schizophrenia
873,"Diagnosis of schizophrenia involves ruling out other mental health disorders and determining that symptoms are not due to substance abuse, medication or a medical condition. There are no blood tests or scans that can prove if you have schizophrenia. Only a psychiatrist can diagnose you after a full psychiatric assessment. We use manuals to diagnose mental illnesses. The main manuals used are:
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) which is produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) which is produced by the American Psychiatric Association.
NHS doctors use the ICD-10.
The manuals explain which symptoms should be present, and for how long.Your symptoms need to last for a least one month before your doctor can diagnose you. They may say you have a psychotic disorder or psychosis before they diagnose you with schizophrenia.
Sometimes the symptoms of schizophrenia are described as positive symptoms or negative symptoms. This does not mean that they are good or bad. (More details on Schizophrenia Symptoms can be found here)
‘Positive’ symptoms are experienced in addition to reality. ‘Negative’ symptoms can effect your ability to function.
Positive symptoms
The terms ‘positive symptoms’ and ‘psychosis’ are generally used to describe the same symptoms. The following are positive symptoms.
Hallucinations
Delusions
Disorganised thinking
Hallucinations
These are experiences that are not real or that other people do not experience. Hallucinations can affect all of your senses which are:
auditory (sound),
visual (sight),
tactile (touch),
gustatory (taste) and
olfactory (smell)
Hearing voices or other sounds is the most common hallucination. Hearing voices is different for everyone.
For example, voices may be:
female or male,
someone you know or someone you’ve never heard,
in a different language or different accent to your own,
whispering or shouting, or
negative and disturbing.
You might hear voices every now and then or all of the time.
Delusions
Delusions are fixed beliefs which do not match up to the way other people see the world. You may not be able to find evidence for or against your belief, and you may look for ways to prove the way you see things.
Delusions may include believing different things such as the following:
you are being chased, plotted against or poisoned,
someone you know, the government or aliens are responsible,
you are a famous or important person,
people on television are sending messages to you, or
your thoughts are being broadcast aloud.
You may feel overwhelmed and act differently due to your beliefs.
Disorganised thinking
Another symptom is ‘disorganised thinking’. This means you might start talking quickly or slowly. The things you say might not make sense to other people. You may switch topics without any obvious link. This is sometimes known as ‘word salad’.
A diagnosis of schizophrenia does not mean that you will have all these symptoms. The way that your illness affects you will depend on the type of schizophrenia that you have. For example, not everyone with this diagnosis will have hallucinations or confused thinking.
Negative symptoms
These are symptoms that involve loss of ability and enjoyment in life. They can include the following things:
Lack of motivation
Slow movement
Change in sleep patterns
Poor grooming or hygiene
Difficulty in planning and setting goals
Not saying much
Changes in body language
Lack of eye contact
Reduced range of emotions
Less interest in socialising or hobbies and activities
Low sex drive
Cognitive Experiences
Another negative symptom is cognitive impairment. This means that your mind is affected in a negative way.
Cognitive experiences are ones that relate to mental action; such as learning, remembering and functioning.
Some cognitive experiences are associated with schizophrenia are:
being unable to sustain attention,
memory problems,
Unable to take on information, and
Poor decision making
Negative symptoms are much less dramatic than positive symptoms. They may last longer, and stay after positive symptoms fade away. Many people with schizophrenia feel that the negative symptoms of their illness are more serious than the positive symptoms. Negative symptoms can vary in severity.
Dr. ELY PELTA",schizophrenia
874,"Well, I haven’t got it, but I do know how people get diagnosed with it. And I do know what the docs say they would prefer doing instead!
Docs would really prefer to do a much more in-depth diagnosis. Have an MRI done, and a clinical neuropsychologist workup. A complete workup with a psychologist. A risk assessment for self harm. A really good complete physical.
Often it’s the first opportunity the person has had for a decent physical in years.
In SOME cases, health insurance slips up and psychiatrists DO get to test for things like lupus (because once in a while, they see other symptoms of lupus and it’s obvious the person has lupus!).
Or the person says he had a head injury or head aches, or seizures, there are signs of dementia or coordination issues, or any number of other things.
You’d be amazed what psychiatrists find along with mental illness. Sleep disorders like apnea. Alcoholism. Substance abuse. Chiari malformations. Dental issues. Diabetes. Obesity. Malnutrition. Heart disease. Abuse. Neglect. PTSD. All sorts of things. We’re really seeing the same illnesses and conditions everyone gets, but as noted, it may be the first time the person has had a really decent examination in years…or…decades…docs would love to give people really complete health care were it not for the stinginess of health insurance. They do the best they can in this area of concern.
The main first job of the doctor is to form a bond with the person. Find some common ground. They will have a lot of work to do together, so the first step is really finding some common ground. Any team needs that.
Most interested lay people are familiar with the ole laundry list of symptoms of schizophrenia. And the doc will ask about those symptoms. How long you’ve had the symptoms, how strong they are.
And of course, you may not think of them as symptoms at all. Your point of view is just not going to be quite the same as people without schizophrenia. But hopefully, you find a way to communicate your experience.
The thing is…schizophrenia can ‘start any way it wants.’ Some people start with just symptoms of depression - they may think that’s all they have. Others start the opposite way - with euphoria. And oh…that euphoria is very, very attractive. It feels great. Many people really wish it would come back and miss it…even years later. Some will even go off medication hoping the euphoria will come back. Euphoria can be very intense. And very, very appealing.
Other people start with very slight positive symptoms - little small visual hallucinations. They may think - did I really just see that? Hm, that’s odd. Others start with a bang - a big huge episode of hallucinations. Others may simply feel paranoid or angry. Paranoia - an overwhelming suspicion or sense of doom that appears to come from a bad force or person. And it may start with something people will agree with…but as time goes on, people get less and less likely to agree with those concerns.
For example, it might start with the IRS. Everyone hates the IRS, right? So for a while, they’ll agree with you, yeah, the IRS is after you, the IRS is after everyone, man. Then…time passes, and now it’s not the IRS, but a much darker, more hidden force, one only you know of…now people are saying to you, no way, man, that’s impossible.
Some people have months or years of vague troubles before they get schizophrenia - this is called a ‘prodrome’. They may feel isolated, awkward, a ‘stranger in a strange land’, long before they get obvious schizophrenia symptoms. They might be, for a while, spiritual or philosophical seekers, looking for answers as to why they feel so disconnected, so cut off, so different from others.
Symptom categories -
Cognitive symptoms - trouble concentrating, completing tasks, specific troubles like copying down numbers or the like. Difficulty understanding what people say, understanding facial expressions…lots of stuff. It may be quite hard to follow all the strange little subtle social cues people give off, too.
“Positive” (meaning ‘things added, things that other people don’t have’) Symptoms. Hallucinations(‘seeing things’, but could be hearing things, feeling things like pressure or pushing, etc), Delusions(‘strange’ ideas, and these ideas may cause a lot of disruption and difficulty in a person’s life…). In some people, Hostility (not quite the same as anger, and caused by delusions - it is not because the person is mean or anything like that).
The hallucinations and delusions are very typical and follow well-known patterns. Even though other conditions may feature hallucinations as a feature, they are unlike hallucinations with schizophrenia, and the person’s reaction to these symptoms is also different from other disorders which have these symptoms.
With hallucinations, a common one with schizophrenia is one or more voices that are making a COMMENTARY on what the person is doing. As far as I know, that type of hallucination is completely unique to schizophrenia.
You could also report having ‘thought blocking.’ It actually seems as if someone ‘stole’ the thought right out of your head. The thought just stops. That’s why many people with schizophrenia think someone else or some…thing…is controlling them.
Anxiety may be a huge issue. Some people have told me that the anxiety is worse than any other symptom of schizophrenia. It can cause real suffering.
“Negative(meaning ‘things taken away, things that other people have’) Symptoms. The person has troubles like a like a lack of intense emotions(instead the person’s mood or ‘affect’ seems ‘flat’), having trouble planning things, enjoying things(‘anhedonia’ - not being able to enjoy things). Well the person himself often doesn’t mind so much(some people with schizophrenia really DO mind - a LOT), but people around him may be very upset that he’s disinterested or doesn’t feel like doing things. The person isn’t depressed or sad, just…doesn’t feel like doing much of anything. Indifferent to a lot of the things he used to like.
Note that many docs will really dig in their heels and refuse to diagnose schizophrenia if there are no ‘Negative Symptoms.’ Especially in kids and teens. Some feel that you just can’t have schizophrenia if you don’t have Negative Symptoms. For them, that’s the ‘hallmark’ of schizophrenia.
What happens then? Well you’re still going to get about the same medication and treatment, and have about the same needs. It might be harder to get SSI and other benefits in the USA, though. So what’s your diagnosis then? it used to be called ‘Psychosis NOS’ (Not otherwise specified) and now I think it’s called ‘Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder’ (as of DSM version 5 - when I first saw that I said, ‘Whaaat? You have GOT to be kidding me!’ But I think that’s what it’s called now.)
And…in fact, tis very rare, but a person could be diagnosed with schizophrenia, without any ‘Positive’ symptoms, just by having very severe symptoms of…the following:
“Disorganization”. here, this word doesn’t have the same meaning as in our everyday use. We’re not talking about losing a notebook or a pen or forgetting an appointment. It’s more profound than that. Like my friend who would want to do something but not be able to do it. Instead he’d wander around aimlessly, unable to finish any one task. The ‘classic’ example of this is the poor guy who just wants to iron his shirt, and collapses halfway across the room to the ironing board and can’t.iron.the.shirt. Similarly, my friend’s mom asked him to take the trash out. He walked out with the trash bag, the trash bag broke, trash went everywhere…and he stood there - he didn’t know what to do. For 45 minutes. Thankfully, his mom came out, looked around and said, “i’ll help you pick up the trash.”
I believe the diagnostic manual still says that a person needs to have symptoms for six months, unless he has a developmental disorder(autism), then symptoms don’t have to be present for a full six months.
It’s alright if that six months includes some months during which medication is taken and symptoms appear to be lessening. He might want to do a ‘washout’ if the person was taking any other prescriptions or using street drugs or alcohol. That means waiting long enough for any of those substances to wear off and seeing how the symptoms look without anything influencing them.
Doc’d especially like to see if symptoms disappear rapidly (Brief Psychotic Disorder, perhaps).
The doc needs to do the best he can to see the pattern of symptoms over time. See if the person’s symptoms lessen and increase in a regular rhythm, get mixed with depression, or get mixed symptoms like bipolar disorder…the doc has a lot to figure out.",schizophrenia
875,"Diagnosing schizophrenia typically involves a comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional. The process usually includes the following steps:
Clinical Interview: The doctor will conduct a detailed interview to gather information about the patient's medical history, symptoms, and any family history of mental illness. They will ask about the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as how these symptoms affect daily functioning.
Symptom Assessment: The clinician will look for specific symptoms of schizophrenia, which may include:
- Hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there)
- Delusions (strongly held false beliefs)
- Disorganized thinking or speech
- Negative symptoms (such as lack of motivation, emotional flatness, or withdrawal from social activities)
Duration of Symptoms: For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time over a month, with some signs of disturbance for at least six months.
Exclusion of Other Conditions: The doctor will rule out other mental health disorders (like bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder with psychotic features) and medical conditions that could cause similar symptoms (such as substance abuse or neurological disorders).
Use of Diagnostic Criteria: Clinicians often use standardized criteria, such as those outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Psychological Testing: In some cases, psychological tests or assessments may be used to further evaluate cognitive function and mood.
Collaboration with Family or Caregivers: Input from family members or caregivers can provide additional context regarding the patient's behavior and functioning.
Once the assessment is complete, the clinician will determine if the criteria for schizophrenia are met and discuss treatment options if a diagnosis is confirmed. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for better management of the disorder.",schizophrenia
876,"The specific DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia are as follows :
The presence of 2 (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated), with at least 1 of them being (1), (2), or (3): (1) delusions, (2) hallucinations, (3) disorganized speech, (4) grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and (5) negative symptoms
For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in 1 or more major areas (eg, work, interpersonal relations, or self-care) is markedly below the level achieved before onset; when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of interpersonal, academic or occupational functioning is not achieved
Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for a period of at least 6 months, which must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated); prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symptoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions
Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms or (2) any mood episodes that have occurred during active-phase symptoms have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness
The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse or a medication) or another medical condition
If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms or schizophrenia are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated)
Associated Features
There are a number of symptoms that contribute to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
Inappropriate affect (laughing in the absence of a stimulus)
Disturbed sleep pattern
Dysphoric mood (can be depression, anxiety, or anger)
Anxiety and phobias
Depersonalization (detachment or feeling of disconnect from self)
Derealization (a feeling that surrounding aren’t real)
Cognitive deficits impacting language, processing, executive function, and/or memory
Lack of insight into disorder
Social cognition deficits
Hostility and aggression
Cognitive impairments caused by the disorder may persist when other symptoms are in remission. This contributes to impairments in functioning in employment, interpersonal relationships, and the ability to engage in proper self-care.",schizophrenia

878,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
879,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.
A very dear friend. A gem of a person. Wish the best for him, wherever he may be now.",schizophrenia
880,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

881,"A doctor or mental health professional would interview the person and ask a lot of questions. They might also ask family members questions if that was possible and okay with the client involved. They also often look at available hospital and medical records to gather information about the person and what they have experienced in those situations. In rare situations they might get information from school staff if the person is very young or involved in college to gather the same information. With all of those things considered the provider would write a diagnostic assessment to document the diagnoses and in it justify how they arrived at their decision.
Another part of the process is matching the symptoms to see if they fit schizophrenia. In mental health the model most used comes from the DSM V or diagnostic and statistical manuel, that provides specific guidelines for schizophrenia and all the other identified current mental health diagnoses currently recognised. Generally two things are key for a schizophrenia diagnoses. One is the presence of some kind of psychotic symptoms that are commonly connected with schizophrenia, and the types involved vary widely in how they happen for people. The other specific thing often attached is some form of disorganized thinking that has strong impacts on a persons ability to function. This one is often described with terms like “word salad” but can actually show up lots of different ways for people.
it’s good to remember too that psychosis and other symptoms can pop up with a variety of other diagnoses as well so it’s impossible to diagnose anyone without gathering some information with the help of a professional. It’s also important to know that time involved is part of the process. Someone, for example, can have short term psychosis for medical reasons, or drugs, or a variety of other causes that can look like schizophrenia. Because of that there is a duration that symptoms must be present to justify this diagnoses.
That’s the process in broad terms. I hope it is helpful.",schizophrenia
882,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
883,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
884,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

885,"No psychiatrist I know would need to look up something in a computer to diagnose schizophrenia.
I'd be extremely wary of anyone that was neither a psychiatrist or psychologist (Ph.D. level) making the diagnosis.
Anyone needing to turn to a computer to make a diagnosis of schizophrenia is not qualified to make a diagnosis. Not only that, but making the diagnosis of schizophrenia is a tremendously important one, and informing the patient of this diagnosis should be done with extreme care and compassion.
I only hope the practioner was looking up codes or something-although even that would be inexcusable.",schizophrenia
886,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
887,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia
888,"I do not diagnose anything. Those who do either have not read current science carefully (as with most med students), or know the score and are in it for the money and power over their clients.
Diagnosis [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qIQqRl94_Y&feature=youtu.be. ] is subjective, not a scientific discipline, and usually leads to treatment with meds. Most often the client is not fully informed of the dangers and benefits.
Some psychiatrists [ https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/01/16/listen-to-the-voices-in-your-head/ ] do not like the term “schizophrenia” and would have it changed.
I feel that the use any of the DSM categories is unethical and should be abolished.

889,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time.

890,"While I appreciate the A2A, I’m actually not a schizophrenic. I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar 1 with psychosis, but not schizophrenia. I do have some pretty mean voices and definitely some altered views on reality and the things that follow, but I’m also lucky enough to get to experience mania, and equally unlucky to be forced to tough out the depression that follows. As far as how I was diagnosed, I’ve dealt with depression for most of the 17 years I’ve been on this Earth, but when I was 11 I told my mom that I had echoing thoughts, one of the first signs you’re manic. I went to my psychiatrist and walked of with a prescription for lithium carbonate, and the rest is history. Really, it was a pretty straightforward process once I voiced my symptoms around someone who knew what those symptoms meant. Hope this helps whatever you’re like looking for.",schizophrenia
891,"Diagnosing schizophrenia is not easy. Sometimes using drugs, such as methamphetamines or LSD, can cause a person to have schizophrenia-like symptoms. The difficulty of diagnosing this illness is compounded by the fact that many people who are diagnosed do not believe they have it. Lack of awareness is a common symptom of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and greatly complicates treatment.
While there is no single physical or lab test that can diagnose schizophrenia, a health care provider who evaluates the symptoms and the course of a person's illness over six months can help ensure a correct diagnosis. The health care provider must rule out other factors such as brain tumors, possible medical conditions and other psychiatric diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder.
To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, a person must have two or more of the following symptoms occurring persistently in the context of reduced functioning:
Delusions
Hallucinations
Disorganized speech
Disorganized or catatonic behavior
Negative symptoms
Delusions or hallucinations alone can often be enough to lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Identifying it as early as possible greatly improves a person’s chances of managing the illness, reducing psychotic episodes, and recovering. People who receive good care during their first psychotic episode are admitted to the hospital less often, and may require less time to control symptoms than those who don’t receive immediate help. The literature on the role of medicines early in treatment is evolving, but we do know that psychotherapy is essential.",schizophrenia
892,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia

My hallucinations can sometimes be quite obvious and sometimes not
For example:I'm laying in my bed relaxing,suddenly I hear weird voices or I feel like somebody is watching me.I look around,open my room’s door and open the windows.
Nothing
I'm alone at night ready go to upstairs and into my bedroom to sleep.I turn the lights of in my living room and turn the lights on in my stairway.I walk upwards normally,suddenly I have the feeling something is behind me and I run upstairs as quickly as I can ,I rush through the door,jump on my bed and stare at the doorway.All light are still on and I just stare for a couple of minutes…nothing else,I even breath very quietly.Then I stand up with my phone in my hand and maybe a pillow or anything I know is actually existing.I go to my door looking straight forward.I look at a black dot at the wall or just something that's ALWAYS there,something I know that should always be there.Then I go outside my room,still staring at that one and then I just instantly look downstairs .I just look down and the ground at the end of the stairs.Then I keep looking at that point on the ground while going backwards into my room,when I can't see the ground anymore I instantly look back at that black dot (or whatever I stared at before leaving my room). I go with my hand around the corner to turn the lights in my stairway off.I keep looking at that dot while going back to my bed.When I reach my bed I just lay down,put my phone right in front of my face and turn it on.I see messages from friends,my girlfriend or random messages from games and so on.I then just lay on my bed watching videos,talking with real people I know or doing things I know are real.
There was nothing in my stairway
There was nothing behind me
I know that, but I don't feel it
I'm playing a videogame with my friend.I hear voices and think…there can't be any voices,I have a headset on and I hear music and my friend’s voice.
But I feel these voices,I hear them ,my mind is telling me that there are voices but I know there aren't
“There can't be any voices” is what I always tell myself in these kind of situations and that helps me…but not completely
I listen to music very loudly with my headset on while my mom is watching TV next to me
I hear a voice and suddenly jump up,throw my headset off and look around…there was no voice,not even my mom was talking
What I'm trying to say is that I'm totally aware of what is happening (most of the time). I know that these voices,sounds and feelings aren't real but I'm not feeling that and I sometimes don't even have a prove
My family and friends always tell me that I'm drifting off very often,that I don't listen to them or that I live in my own world (aka daydreaming,listening to loud music and playing videogames intensively)
But I do that on purpose because my mind needs to be full,it needs to be COMPLETELY full,so I know what's real and what's not.
When I just hear music these voices make me go crazy,scare me and shock me
When I do nothing they make me confused and irritated
But when my mind is completely full I can ignore them

894,"I’ve had prodromal symptoms for about 5 years. Sometimes I thought people talk behind my back - stuff like that I’m gay or weird. I had problems relating to others. That’s why I was immersed in personal development and was kind of self help junkie. Sometimes I saw connections everywhere, like the traffic sign STOP would mean sth to me. Like to stop thinking about sth or stop talking about what I was talking about.
I had a lot of insecurities and a lot of energy to work on myself. I was going to the gym, had long morning rituals, meditated and read a lot of books. But somehow, I wasn't able to help myself. Anxiety was with me wherever I went. I was also very angry at my parents as I thought I have these problems because of them.
One day when I got home from my work I just stopped working on myself. It was the first time in 5 years I didn’t have the urge to fix something. That night I started hearing my neighbours talking how I’m gay and how I should go out and find a girl or they will not stop talking through the wall. I went out in the middle of the night searching for a girl to prove them wrong. When I got home I heard them again. Like they were mumbling something how I’m uncapable to find a woman for myself. Something was wrong. It was going worse and worse and after 10 days I was in mental hospital. I was there for 2 months.
My point is - it just erupted in my life. Nobody thought something was wrong with me, only me. I sensed deep in myself that something is missing and that I’m not a person I should be. For 5 years!",schizophrenia
895,"I honestly believe paranoid schizophrenia is the same thing as post traumatic stress disorder but no one knows what the stress is that caused this scrambling of the brain.
I base this on my early years from grades 1–6. There was a “newspaper boy” (he was not a boy! ) who walked around with his paper bag slung over his shoulder and a huge German Shepard which he called a police dog. He told me that if I told anyone what he was doing he would call the police on me. I was only 6 years old when it started. I didn't ever revise my thinking as I grew. I just believed him when he said he'd call the police. I connected his police dog with the police. It didn't help either that police would patrol the neighborhood and not even question him but actually stop and start conversations with him and wave at him as they drove by. Yes, he was sexually abusing me, using lewd language, talking a lot about making me suck a certain part of his body. I blocked out a lot of the actual abuse by now, but I still remember the fear, the shaking.
Now you tell me how such a scenario that happened regularly, daily for years would not mess up a kids thinking. Think about it? What would it make the child?
Paranoid. Paranoia that looks like self consciousness, so no one questions it. Until you are older. Then they start calling your self consciousness paranoia.
Trust me, paranoia is a type of post traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is hip these days. It's cool to have this disorder. I don't mean to take this lightly. I'm merely pointing out there is no stigma attached to it. But there is a TON of stigma attached to being paranoid sadly. This makes it a thousand times worse. But essentially these are the same thing. I truly believe that because I experienced it, and for good reason.
I am sure that at the root of paranoia is trauma, maybe repeated subtle trauma or maybe trauma as I described but no one makes the connection.
I don't know if anyone has studied these two disorders together but had I chosen to stay in the psychology field I would have.
Someone mentioned that hallucinations and delusions a paranoid schizophrenic has. I will admit that above I was actually talking about paranoia as a way to perceive the world and nothing else. I believe paranoia as I described it is nothing more than self consciousness and fear.
But they are right, paranoid schizophrenia is more complicated. The first thing to realize is it's just a label for a cluster of independent symptoms. Psychologists don't even know if these symptoms have same cause. But they do find them together enough to put them under a label.
I believe that delusions and hallucinations can also be a result of post traumatic stress disorder. Just be aware as you read this, my conclusions are not based on research but on my own experience and speculation. But all science begins with daring to speculate. And maybe someone had already thought of these things. I haven't read the latest psychology.
I believe delusions could be considered a post traumatic reaction. If someone is being laughed at or hurt, and that person seems to be loved by the whole community, your brain could easily jump to the conclusion that everyone else is perceiving you the same way as that person. You may not make the connection in your conscious mind but your unconscious could be drawing this conclusion. Therefore if you don't know the root of why you think everyone is against you it appears not to have a reason: the definition of a delusion. When really, it's a post traumatic stress reaction and nothing more. This could get extreme like thinking your food is poisoned etc. because you have learned to approach the world through mistrust instead of trust.
I believe hallucinations could also be post traumatic stress reactions. By far the most common hallucinations are hearing voices that comment on your behavior or deride you in some way. It sounds a lot like what many kids have to put up with all through grade school. Eventually, grade school kids stop this behavior and move on or mature. But the person affected by this behavior may still be haunted by it. In the absence of this happening anymore, they still have thoughts that there is something wrong with them. This is reinforced now by voices that take the place of the grade school kids who used to always comment on their behavior and make fun of them. This is just a scenario. It could fit any age. I would like to know if bullying or constant criticism or passive aggressive people were in the lives of those who develop hallucinations.
Another reason for hallucinations could be trauma. When I was a toddler my dad broke into my house and I saw him hold a butcher knife to my mom’s throat. It was scary but did I show my fear? Not at all. Instead it manifest itself in these two ways:
I couldn't go into this room without hearing a voice from the wall telling me they were going to kill my mom. This wall was what separates my mom’s bedroom. My mom’s bedroom was where the threat to her life happened. Coincidence? I don't think so. But I was terrified to go into this room. It was the only place I heard the voice.
I was afraid to be in the kitchen when my mom was using the butcher knife. It brought me a lot of anxiety. A post trauma reaction.
I didn't connect any of these things to the trauma. A mother or maybe not even a psychologist would have known to explore in this direction to figure it out. It's only I that knew later in life when I reflected in my own life.
I honestly don't think flat labels help. It's hard to uncover why people are the way they are but I think there is always a reason even if it is never uncovered. I also think these patterns can be changed with resocialization if they are truly loved and learn to trust the world and themselves.",schizophrenia
896,"Paranoid schizophrenia, also called schizophrenia, paranoid type, is a sub-type of schizophrenia as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-V It has been the most common type of schizophrenia. People with paranoid delusions are unreasonably suspicious of others. This can make it hard for them to hold a job, run errands, have friendships, and even go to the doctor.
Common symptoms for paranoid schizophrenia include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and paranoid delusions (believing everyone is out to cause the sufferer harm)
Common delusions associated with paranoid schizophrenia include, “believing that the government is monitoring every move you make, or that a co-worker is poisoning your lunch.""",schizophrenia
897,"Recently, Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type, as been removed from the updated list of psychiatric disorders, to be replaced by Schizophrenia. Nevertheless, people who have schizophrenia and have paranoid symptoms typically may have any of the following symptoms:
Hallucinations- experiencing perceptions that other people do not. These may include visual (seeing things- people, animals demons, etc. ), auditory (hearing voices or sounds), tactile (feeling things on your skin), or any combination of the above. About 80 % of people with hallucinations hear voices, about 20% see things and smaller numbers of people have other types of hallucinations.
Delusions- having odd beliefs- often fears that people are listening on their phone calls, listening to the person through heater vents, following them in cars, or believing that others are conspiring to harm them in some way. People may become hyper-religious, believing that God speaks with them or believing that they are God or Jesus.
These people may also have confused thoughts.
Schizophrenia is a very serious mental illness mental disorder which often severely impairs people's social, work or other functioning. It is generally treatable with medications or therapy, and people who are experiencing these or similar symptoms should seek treatment right away, as it appears that the longer people have these symptoms the harder it is to get them under control. These disorders typically become evident in teens or twenties, but can manifest earlier or later.",schizophrenia
898,"Schizophrenia with paranoia is a mental illness with symptoms of hallucinations and delusions with paranoia elements. There's a component of psychosis to this illness. Schizophrenia has a marked discrepancy between the person's beliefs and reality. The paranoia results in the delusions presenting themselves as beliefs that someone is out to get you or that there is a conspiracy to harm you, etc. It's one of the more often portrayed mental illnesses in the and in the movies. Novel Prize winner John Nash was a schizophrenic with paranoia, and his life story was made into the film A Beautiful Mind starting Russell Crowe.",schizophrenia

Furthermore , Controling your private sky and space is important to protect the rights of your citizens, especially peace and privacy.
If a foreign agent wants gather private data and information from your country , what security and defense measures you have taken to protect the satellites of a foregen agent , or thier camiras or phone tracking system , to invade the privacy of a family by watching , evasdropping, take pictures with hidden camiras , listening to them by advanced mics , while a husband and wife are taking shower , talking private, and sleeping or walking naked in thier houses ?

Look at the real governments like European that protect the rights of thier citizens from foreign spies that sell your citizens private life , pictures , videos, images and private conversations , stories of you and your family.

900,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

901,"In the past, schizophrenia was divided up into types - paranoid, simple, catatonic, hebephrenic, over time there were slightly different ideas of what these subtypes should be, a little bit of shuffling here and there but no major changes… but through it all, it was believed these different types were distinct. In fact, everyone was very very confident about those types.
But problems developed, and the types got more and more…. uncomfortable. In fact they started to downright chafe, in all the wrong places.
They fit in less and less with the research. Someone noticed that the types didn’t ‘inherit reliably.’ Mom could have paranoid schizophrenia, and her son have hebephrenic schizophrenia. Plus, if you looked at the genetics, it wasn’t like the genetic information was organized into those specific four or five distinct types. At all. And that made no sense - IF the subtypes really were a thing.
Further, it was looking more and more like you couldn’t even make any hard and fast rules about the subtypes. ‘Simple’ didn’t always have a lousy outcome, ‘paranoid’ didn’t always have such a great outcome. What in the heck was even the use of having the subtypes, if it didn’t help you pick treatment or tell family what sort of future the person would have?
Further, many people had more paranoid symptoms some times, and had more like disorganized or simple symptoms at other times…. that one was REALLY uncomfortable.
All these problems.
Eventually, the subtypes were chafing in all the wrong parts and authors just quietly took them out of the new diagnostics.
And frankly, I’m glad.",schizophrenia
902,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
903,"First of all, just a note: the paranoid subtype of schizophrenia is no longer recognized by the DSM.
Anyway…(sorry). I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2007. I had a psychotic break, which resulted in me being fired, moving back home, and then running away to New York and ultimately ending up in a mental hospital in New Jersey.
I am an outlier when it comes to schizophrenia because I am, most of the time, very lucid on the meds. A person meeting me or engaging me in conversation wouldn’t suspect I was schizophrenic. They might consider me loopy but I was always loopy.
I am on a medication called olanzapine. It makes me sleep 10–14 hours a day and I have to take frequent naps. That, plus the general zombification caused by the meds (even the newer meds - the atypical antipsychotics) is why it is hard to get schizophrenics to take their medication. If you had to be tired and in a stupor every second of your life from here on, would it be something you’d easily accept?
When I am not on my medication, I feel like I am out of control but alive. I feel like the book I’m trying to write is the most amazing book ever and that the universe gives me coded messages in music etc. I feel like I matter, even if it is mostly in a negative way.
My whole life I’ve felt uncertain. The only time things have ever made sense was in my psychotic break. It was a horrible kind of sense but I finally felt like everything fit into place. There were answers to all those questions I’ve asked my whole life.
There was a woman in the hospital who saw angels. What would you give to meet a real angel? On the other hand, I’ve known schizophrenics who get the tactile sensation of being raped on an almost nightly bases by evil, spectral demons. I had a hallucination along those lines myself once.
With the medication, I still have the beginnings of delusions and paranoia. Like I might see a car drive by the house too slowly. I still find that suspicious and it still puts me on edge. But, I am eventually able to reason it away.
Without the meds, that suspicion grows and grows until I realize I’m being stalked by nazi meth head bikers.
In my psychotic break, I experienced mostly auditory hallucinations, some visual hallucinations and a few tactile hallucinations. I thought that if I asked the wind a question, it would tell me the answer. I could feel it blow against my right or left hand to answer me. If I remember correctly, right was yes and left no.
Right before I ended up in the hospital, the wind told me I was a vile monster and the only way I could save myself is by self castration.
Ultimately, the only person I was a danger to was myself. That is true of most schizophrenics. Violence against others isn’t something I tend towards and that was true even in my psychotic break.
The thing people don’t understand is that when you are in an episode, it is your reality. People don’t question their reality as much as we believe and so this new one is the truth. When the wind spoke to me, it did tell me the truth. That was what was real to me.
Like if I could go into a person’s brain and change oranges to taste like peaches, then oranges would be peaches and the person wouldn’t question that. Reality is not as concrete and certain as people like to believe. It all depends on how good your scientific equipment (your brain and sensory organs) are.
I am not ashamed of being schizophrenic but it is not something one readily tells people. If I had cancer and told people I’d get sympathy. If you have schizophrenia people worry you are going to attack them. This is true even of people who you knew before you got ill.
I don’t have much contact with people. I keep my life simple and quiet. I only leave the house to go to doctor’s appointments. And I spend most of my time trying to distract myself from being sad or wanting too much.",schizophrenia
904,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.

First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
905,"Paranoid schizophrenia is the most common form of schizophrenia. Paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by predominantly positive symptoms (added to the existing normal state of being) of schizophrenia, including delusions and hallucinations. These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what isn't, making it difficult for the person to lead a typical life.
Some major characteristics are:
Seeing, hearing, or tasting things that don't actually exist.
Suspiciousness and a general fear of others' intentions and one’s safety.
Persistent, unusual thoughts or beliefs about anything.
Difficulty thinking clearly, disorganized or clouded thinking.
Social withdrawal.
A significant decline in self-care and basic hygiene.
A combination of physical, genetic, psychological, and environmental factors can make a person more likely to develop the condition. Some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode.",schizophrenia
906,"Thanks for the A2A. I apologize for the delay in responding.
What makes it really challenging to deal with paranoid schizophrenia is the fact that it exaggerates normal and logical reasoning to a proportion that's crippling and dysfunctional. Unfortunately drugs don't help much in this regard. However understanding, acceptance and a resolve to observe while disengaged with paranoid thoughts might qualitatively reduce the amount of distress experienced.
By acknowledging that your paranoid state is exaggerated version of regular fears, you are already ahead. Considering this analogy might help. Imagine that you are traveling in a bus. This journey is very important to you and has to be made, even if at great price. It's an overnight trip and your co-passenger is extremely annoying, mean even. Despite trying your failure to shut this person up, you have to continue the journey. You would rather discontinue the journey if given a choice, but you can't because this journey is too important to you. Letting this annoying person ruin that is not what you want to do. So what do you do? Muster patience and start ignoring the provoking shoved your way. Now consider this bus as your mind, this journey as life's time-line, the annoying co-passenger as your paranoid thoughts and yourself as that awareness in you that knows what's right thing to do and what is going on. You don't have to beat or defeat the co-passenger (paranoid thoughts), you have to step back and ignore. With practice you will get better at ignoring. Seek therapy to help yourself learn better ignoring or dealing techniques. When you stop engaging your paranoid thoughts, keep them on standby by being indifferent to them, they will eventually lose significance. Fighting them will acknowledge them further in your head, give them the negative attention that will cause them to persist. Remember, what we resist, persists, as C. G Jung famously quoted.
Hope this helps!",schizophrenia
907,"PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA
This is a most common type of Schizophrenia in which the person gets more hallucinations and delusions.
The life of such paranoid schizophrenics is marked by suspicions, isolation and doubts about others that the invisible visions and un-hearable sounds tortures them and they are not able to lead a normal life and proceeds for daily waking nightmares.
HERE ARE THE COMMON PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA SYMPTOMS:
1. Hallucinations & Delusions: They hear and see visions which are not there in real.
2. In anger which is unexplainable.
3. Gets disconnected emotionally & mentally with the known or near ones.
4. They get severely anxious and agitated.
5. Behavior becomes too much argumentative.
6. Behavior is too much violent and proceed for violent tendencies.
7. Prefer self-importance and believes that he or she has special powers.
8. They get frequent suicidal thoughts and behavior also becomes negative and suicidal.
APART FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED, THE SYMPTOMS OF PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA CAN ALSO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
1. Thinking getting too much disorganized.
2. Demotivated to do anything and always facing lack in motivation.
3. Getting too slow in any movement.
4. The sleep timings and sleeping patterns get changed a lot.
5. Becomes least attentive to hygiene.
6. Gets lot of changes in their body language and emotions.
7. They also become least interested in the social activities.
8. Feels low sex drive.
DISORGANIZED SCHIZOPHRENIA
Disorganized Schizophrenia is a long term mental illness and is considered to be one of the several sub types of Schizophrenia. It is also known by the name of
Hebephrenic Schizophrenia
. In the condition of Disorganized Schizophrenia, a person gets extremely disorganized in any of the emotions of life. It is thought to be in the extreme of disorganization syndrome that has been assumed or imagined to be
one feature of a 3-factor model of schizophrenia symptoms. Among the other 2 factors, one is delusions/ hallucinations in which the person lives in a distorted and imaginary reality which is not present and the other factor is psycho motor poverty which is poor in speech, lack of spontaneous movement, and blunting emotion. In this factor, person loses his or her control over speech and lacks too much in any of the spontaneous movement or action required in general life along with total blunted emotions. The patient of Disorganized Schizophrenia is characterized by totally confused and illogical thoughts and behavior. In other words, their behavior and speech along with actions is extremely agitated and purposeless.
Disorganized Schizophrenia is considered a more severe type of Schizophrenia as the patients in this condition don’t and can’t take care of their daily routine activities like preparing and having meals or taking care of the hygiene issues. Their speech becomes so much smashed that no one can ever understand whatever they want to say.
SYMPTOMS OF DISORGANIZED SCHIZOPHRENIA
Unstructured Thinking: In the condition of Disorganized Schizophrenia, person is unable to form any clear or logical thoughts and this inability affects his/ her speech which also becomes unclear and disorganized in which a person cannot stick to the point of talk but keeps changing the subject of issue. The speech problem becomes so severe at times in certain cases that it is perceived as meaningless and confused (a mess of sounds) to those around him/her.
Chaotic Behavior: In this symptom, the person is unable to take care of the daily routine activities and also becomes unable to decide over basic things of life like, taking bath, getting ready after bath or for any other function of daily life, or even preparing and having meals. They may take meaningless tensions or they may show sexual behavior in public. Such disorganized behavior may appear to be normal to schizophrenics but very strange and unusual to the public or the people around them. Their behaviors vary from being childlike or silly or getting too much aggressive and violent on normal issues of life.
Lacking Emotional Expression: With this symptom, person becomes fully blank in showing or expressing emotions as per the condition or situation. The patient appears extremely indifferent and unconcerned. They don’t talk properly or be in eye contact with the other nor do they show any body language relating to the issues they might be trying to discuss. They may show behaviors which are not at all expected or pursued for the present situation like they may laugh out loud on a very serious issue or condition.",schizophrenia
908,"If a person suffering from schizophrenia also has paranoid thoughts it's paranoid schizophrenia.
It's referred to as paranoia when a person has the delusion of persecution, that is a false belief that people are conspiring against him.",schizophrenia
909,"In high school, my friend Neil was rather remarkable.
He was smart, a very good athlete, extremely outspoken, and he was born with a strong sense of justice. He often got engaged in fights when someone was bullied, and he always stood at the right side of the conversation.
I immediately liked him.
Although he quickly became one of my best friends of the time, he rarely talked about his family.
I knew he had a brother, and I also knew that at some moment in time, that brother attended our high school, but now he definitely was not here anymore.
Neil did not say a word.
Only much later — near the end of twelfth grade, he explained that his brother had mental problems, and that he was psychologically unstable. But that was only since “the darkness” happened.
I did not know what that was.
On one evening — an evening of drinking bootleg tequila, smoking cheap cigars and listening to Nirvana — he finally told me.
His mother had committed suicide about five years ago, and I was the first he told in person. Except for some family members, nobody knew.
Even the neighbors did not know. They thought she had left, and his dad never spoke about it.
(His dad had always been a very quiet man.)
She has been suffering from schizophrenia, and became convinced she could talk to Jesus when she was standing in doorways. (This is not a joke.)
When she could not handle the voices anymore, she hanged herself, and Neil’s brother was the one who found her. And something cracked.
A couple of months later, Neil traveled abroad to study in another country.
It turned out to be a mistake.
But he had his mind set: he wanted to be free, be away from home and “the darkness” (which still very much lived in his dad’s house), and learn a new language while he was at it.
University studies in a new language turned out to be hard, and deeply ashamed about his failure, he kind of faded from my life.
In the meanwhile, I had (finally) met his brother, and he turned out to be okay.
Since it was next to impossible to be in contact with Neil, his brother filled in the gap in some sense, and we often went out to have drinks with other friends.
Dan was trying law school, was pretty smart — not like his brother, but still — and very strange.
When he talked about “the darkness,” he often collapsed in total silence, staring into emptiness. He was obsessed with “what people were saying behind his back,” and it got worse, and worse, and worse.
One day, he called me, shouting “he knew what I was saying about him,” and “that he never wanted to see me again.”
And that was the last time I saw him for more than 10 whole years.
A few years later, he was committed to a mental hospital, and when he was discharged, he was a different person.
Locked inside himself, closer to “the darkness” than ever before.
When Neil surfaced again, something had changed.
There was “a new darkness” now, and it had ruined him.
I remembered that the few times I saw him in the last couple of years, he had started to develop this strange idea that one should be able to “summarize entire university level books in one sentence,” and he was searching for this sentence in each and every of his textbook and class notes.
That was how he started to fail courses.
In search for sentences that explain books.
“The new darkness” appeared to be the culmination of his obsession: he was eventually found in a room, sitting on the ground, and writing down sentences on little pieces of paper.
He was nearly starved in this episode of total self-neglect, and his room was filled with thousands and thousands (!) scraps of paper, each containing nothing more than unreadable doodles.
He also turned out to have stolen a wheelchair, in which he drove around, convinced that he could not walk anymore.
But now he was “better.”
I could almost cry to see this man move, knowing he once had been an excellent basketball player, and long-distance runner. He walked at a snail’s pace, talked extremely slowly, and used his hands (and especially his thumbs) in a very weird way when he was talking. (Check out Quentin Tarantino, and you’ll know exactly what I mean.)
He said that he wasn’t able to pass his driver’s exam road test, because everything happened too fast, and he was not able to react.
Even when it was very warm outside, he was dressed in a set of green rugs, wearing an old base ball cap, and looking almost frightful.
At times, he seemed to be absent, as if he was about to fall asleep while talking.
At other times, his eyes were ever so wide, and I strongly suspected him of seeing and hearing things which were not there.
It was then that I realized that my friend Neil was gone, and that he was too far away from shore to be able to get back.
Drowning in “the new darkness,” and fighting the demons of his mother, and his brother.
And suffocating without ever producing a single sound.

910,"I am 49. I have schizophrenia from past 5 years- a sudden late onset. I have been mostly hearing voices and feeling movements and tactile sensations on my body and have had a delusion (although only once, right in the beginning 5 yrs ago that lasted a few days). I also had mild paranoid thoughts that only lasted a couple months off and on but nothing serious or sustaining- this happened as one of the first signs. I have never been hospitalised. I have also been a Vipassana (mindfulness) meditator for 20 years so I am a strong observer of my mind. Professionally I have been an Electronics scientist and software engineer, done great in academics and career. Hence I am qualified to write this answer. I will keep improving this answer. This is my personal observation and experience of schizophrenia, not based on any religious beliefs. I have also read many schizophrenia papers, talked to people suffering from it in person, through forums or social media accounts and Quora.
Based on my experiences (no beliefs) I am theorising it here. It’s upto to you to believe it. Two things are for sure-
The role of mindfulness meditative practices is imperative to understand schizophrenia and
There are outside forces in schizophrenia.
What is schizophrenia?
Firstly I would like you to check out the TED talk on “How to control someone else’s arm” to understand how we behave when neurologically connected. If our nervous systems are in contact one of us behaves as a master and the other a slave. Thus we can give commands to the other and the other has to follow our will. This has also been confirmed in an experiment called brain to brain communication by university of Washington. You can google it. Now, with this background let's go further.
Secondly, for the medical industry who is doing research- please don’t ignore the details of the symptoms and stress less on statistics. Investigation of schizophrenia needs some physics and metaphysics- just a biology or chemistry view won’t suffice. Also it may be prudent to consider external interference as the starting theory for schizophrenia.
Cause-
Finally in my view and personal experience - schizophrenia is a phenomenon where an external entity (possibly an evil spirit or demon because the activity is demonic by nature) with malevolent intention connects to a human mind and body to do harm. Neurologically it can be seen as a multi mind phenomenon where two minds are connected neurologically. Their mental content (beliefs, feelings, etc) can travel through the human neurological barrier and manifest on the human body thereby allowing the evil spirits’ mind to be felt by the human as if his own. Thoughts, feelings and behaviours of the human thus get affected because the minds of the entity and the human being are connected. An induced thought or feeling causes irrational beliefs, symptoms and behaviours in the human being. I’ll be sharing this in more detail further down.
Why would an evil spirit be able to connect with a human?
If the human’s neurological, physical or mental barrier is weak due to stress, anxiety, depression, nervousness, thinking, muscle weakness, too much thought or feelings etc. But still if human awareness and cognition is strong he or she will be able to distinguish between the evil spirits’ mental content and it’s own.
How these spirits connect I don’t know. But they surely harm by bombarding the human being with vibrations of all kind- due to their connection sensory media like voices, images, smells, feelings etc and physical movements are generated causing sound, visions, etc and tactile sensations in the human. They can also play with the human faculty- memories, beliefs, thoughts and feelings. The idea is to weaken the human faculty mentally and physically so they can be harmed, controlled and possessed. Sometimes sexual harms and pain or torture is also inflicted upon the human being by using movements and vibrations. (I have experienced all the symptoms) Voices help in keeping the connection between the human and the entity alive, it also helps with control. For example if you keep talking to someone it’ll be difficult for the person to concentrate or pay attention on his activities. These entities can be distant and hidden in some cases and evident and within the human beings space in some cases- causing a range in which people experience schizophrenia.
Demons or evil humans?
For a long time once i started experiencing these symptoms, especially voices, I had this theory that these are lowly humans who have learnt some cheap tricks in cults or got access to some kind of signalling devices so they can do such harms. Because who believes in evil spirits? And so I thought they are doing this for terrorism of some kind. My hope was I could catch them some day. For example I thought they would “commit the mistake” of spilling out their names or where they live during “voices” interaction etc. So i would suddenly ask them- “whats your name” etc. But over time I observed their extreme ignorance and extreme “continuity” of harms (they never stop) and feel that this can’t be the work of a human being, not even a deranged psychopath. Humans can’t be so ruthless and cannot do harms “continuously” because they would need to take a food or bathroom break at least? These beings never stop. So its more plausible that these are evil spirits of some kind and for the sake of ease I am calling them demons. Another reason for assuming them as evil spirits or demons is that what they do matches well with what is written or spoken about them according to various spiritual philosophies or texts. Still I am open to the idea of this being a human cultish or witchcraft activity but mainly would like to emphasise here that there is clear interference from outside- not any delusions. Or rather any delusions are actually a result of the play of these demonic beings. So the theory is- “there are outside malevolent harmful forces present in schizophrenia that are the cause of the symptoms”. Who or what they are , we need to investigate and theorise later. Right now we can just investigate the nature of interaction and how the manifestation causes the symptoms. (Many voice hearers and schizophrenics say the same thing- that there are outside forces- demons or targeted individuals theory- but this is ignored by medical science). What I am trying to say is that majority of humans who are suffering from a severe case of schizophrenia- at least hearing voices and feeling tactile sensations, surely attribute the cause of schizophrenia as “external”.
My case and the harms
In my case the demons violate my physical space and live with me. (There is a physical presence and violation I feel and their intention is to possess my whole faculty- which is basically about solving their life’s problem “forever”. If they violate the human space and get inside others they can experience the human faculty which is far superior than theirs-for example my demons like to enact facial expressions very much- they keep tapping into my memory for images and act out various expressions- these expressions can travel to them and help them “feel” the sensations and the expressions. That gives them the “feeling” of being alive or being “someone”. Seemingly they have subtle bodies and so the attachment to a physical form like us) They are also very interested in sex- it is the highest vibration they can enjoy. Their other driver is sexual energy which they collect and feed on to live.
They don’t eat, drink or sleep. They talk to me - it started with berating words for the first couple years (no impact on me except for concentration issues) to gain control over my mind but they had a lot of difficulty defeating my logic. They gave up and now it is normal conversation mostly about themselves- what they want etc (mostly to enjoy harming someone- logic is: since they can’t be happy no one else should be) and do movements using harmful vibrations (heat/burning) that harm my body physically. They can create physical pressure on my body and cause pain, strangulate my throat, cause me to cough, give me pain anywhere, block my thoughts, cause a limp in my walk, give me dream like states, do physical harms etc. All this is temporary and changes. According to them it is their “way of life”. They enjoy harming and are incapable of anything else. The voices say “Maza aata hai”. That is why they do it.
I’ll give you another example of their harms- they had told me about their intention to want me to be disabled (5 years ago) by showing me the image of a wheelchair- my legs and arms should not work because that means I will be on the bed and in a susceptible or vulnerable position which they prefer. They used the word “parapleigic”. I had to google it because i did not know what it meant. At that time I barely heard one or two voices once in a while with rare physical violations. Anyways back to the story, so they kept their word and started harming my legs by doing repetitive front and back movements and in the past two years I have been harmed so much that my feet has enormous swelling due to the inflammation caused by this and walking is now difficult for me. I already have a disability due to schizophrenia. Recently it pushed something burning like sensation into my left arm (shoulder joint point) so now my left arm is twisted. It keeps inflicting pain in it every now and then. I got an X-ray done day before yesterday and the technician found that I have an affected tendon in my left shoulder. The demons don’t let me use the left arm, if I use it to wear clothes or lift my arm for something they immediately instill pain in me. They can also “control” me. Just like in the TED talk “How to control someone else’s arm”. They have also harmed my lower organs by inflicting pain and movements doing physical harms whenever they like. Once the harm is done they are able to send some kind of flux which supposedly collects the sensations on my body and sends it to them- they now being able to feel my sensations. These are not delusions. My legs and arms aren’t working. Btw many schizophrenia patients report this kind of torture which is completely ignored by doctors (I have read all scientific research on schizophrenia).
In my case the harms are too much and the demons don’t hide themselves. They also tell me what they are doing next. I don’t think I was a schizophrenia candidate at all. Some demons are afraid to come in, so they get stuff from multiple people and prefer being distant. In some cases penetrating a human being may not be possible for various reasons like very good mental and physical health etc. Hence it is not possible for everyone with schizophrenia to know there are other beings connected to them.
Also btw my demon says this- “I want someone to stop me, who can stop me. I can’t be caught.”
Telecommunications Signaling
I have studied Electronics engineering and Computer Sc and worked in telecommunications software. I have also done semiconductor electronics research in US. I know a thing or two about signaling. To those who are not initiated to the basic concepts of telephony- voice is modulated after getting mixed with a carrier wave of high frequency so it can be transmitted and sent to a remote location. I want to share that there is signaling happening on and around me all the time. A signal shower comes in and fills my aura (I don’t know what really aura is but what I mean is the area around me that might contain my subtle energy and defines me). I feel it clearly as a flux. It happens at least once a day and especially at night when I am lying down. It fills me up and then movements begin around me or on me to harm me. It seems to me that these movements which have harmed my physical self significantly seem to cause my own signals or flux to be transmitted. The movements are “back and forth” repetitive movements across my body parts. Also the communication with the entities has a lot of methodology - for example they talk to me continuously until I say something in response. The moment I say something (in response to their talking because it’s difficult to ignore) a flux is transmitted from my body to outside somewhere. They are always on the look out for me to talk and respond- as if they get something out of it. Something about the movements and my talking to them helps them. I think they are using carrier wave technology in the same way- (this is nether a joke, nor my belief, nor a lie) when I say something the connection between them and me gets activated (both ways) and transmission of my energy or something else is possible. Sometimes I worry if these are humans and remotely connecting to me because then we are in grave danger. I also think (and have been told) that the more of my vibrations they have , the more control they have over me. They are also after sexual energy. I also don’t know why they tell me stuff- maybe they are too confident that they won’t be caught. Sometimes I think they are human but then what I don’t understand is why would they harm so much and that too continuously. I have refrained from certain topics in this write up for the sake of the not jarring experience of the reader. But there are extremes in the harms they do.
Realm of imagination/ tactile sensations
This is a theory but based on factual observations and also something that medical science will validate. These beings connect with us through our imagination circuitry- creating images, delusions inside us. For those who feel a lot of tactile sensations, and even see auras of beings entering the mind body system in your vicinity- it is not your delusion. It is this beings connecting through our imagination system which is also connected to our motor neurons. When you see an image and feel beings moving around or across you it is the motor neurons connected to the imaginary circuitry that are activated. Like when we imagine something we feel those emotions in our body and can even feel as if we are doing something?
Like if I haven’t completed my homework and I am afraid of going to school tomorrow let’s say I start imagining this- I am walking to my school and seeing my teacher, I feel afraid or avoid him since I haven’t done my homework and then I imagine the teacher sees me and is getting angry at me- while these images play on my mind, my corresponding emotions as well as feeling of walking etc can also be felt during the imagination process although nothing is real. Thus motor neurons and other neural circuitry is activated in imagination. This is already verified by medical science. Now in schizophrenia what I am saying is that patients are NOT imagining anything themselves- they are forced media onto these portals. These demonic beings are utilising the neurological circuits of imagination when it comes to projecting images and tactile sensations on the body. They for example may connect with you and play with images in your mind such that such imagination- paths are triggered. These are not delusions as understood by medical industry. These are external entities having access to your nervous system and playing with it. It is important that medical research pays attention to these things.I know this by noticing keenly for 4 years. Not any beliefs. Currently “everything” is loaded under one term- delusion and people are given psychotic medicines for it believing that they are imagining everything themselves. Medical Imaging has shown that when voices are heard and all these other symptoms manifest- the imagination areas of the brain are activated. But the difference is that we are not doing this by our own selves or due to our own illness- it is happening because the spirit energies connected to us are playing with our system.
Connecting material-
They have multiple invisible substances and mediums that they insert into my space which numbs body sensations and act as a medium to throw things like movements, vibrations into it. This is not my imagination. I can feel it very clearly. One of the stuff inserted has a slippery feel. It is organic. It could be a collection of their gross feelings like greed or something else because (where would demons keep “stuff”). Once they insert it in and around my legs for example they can throw in a movement style like someone else’s walking style. Then when they activate it my legs move like that. The medium keeps the memory of a movement inserted (like Bollywood actor Devanand’s walking style) or facial expression (like Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore’s smile) intact and can be played just like a movie again and again. But mostly they use these mediums or substances to harm you physically- using up and down, back and forth movements to inflict pain and break down your body to make it weak, sexually harm you etc. They have access to our memory so they can download any media and get movement styles ,facial expressions etc from it. They can show the image of a film star for example and download her smile onto my face - the feeling of that facial expression comes into my face. I won’t look like that but I will feel that I have a similar expression on my face- the feeling is similar. If you knew well how mind and body works this could be understood easily.
The flat affect in schizophrenia
The flat affect in schizophrenia is the person not feeling much emotion even while talking about a traumatic event etc. In other words he or she doesn’t seem to exhibit any emotion. I have been dealing with schizophrenia for past 4–5 years, I see it clearly as demonic interference and I can explain what happens and what causes this effect.
Everyday since schizophrenia began as hearing voices in my case, a shower of vibration started coming over me. The shower would be very clear, and would only last for a minute or two in the beginning. It would be also very light and I did not really know what it was for or what it did. But it was clearly a shower of vibrations. Now as months and years passed this shower started becoming a strong flux of vibrations entering me every night from the top of my head. Once the vibrations became palpable I started observing what it did (and continues to do now). The vibrations feel very slippery, craving-like that slide around me- it has a feathery feeling. I have strong aversion for this vibration. It has an organic quality and surely has a heedless or greed-like quality to it. Once it slides in, it covers me everywhere in my body and suddenly all the vibrations I was feeling until now- my own vibrations of pain, heat, numbness, tiredness, itch etc on my body - suddenly vanish. Suddenly there is no feeling. Because of this newly added external layer that acts like a cushion. Here is the side effect- since I don’t feel my own vibrations anymore it also makes me feel “ok” however bad the situation- as in I am no more in any pain or tiredness etc. Because I can’t feel my feelings. It’s through my feelings that I come to know how I am. Now that awareness is gone. But I know this is not normal and is happening because this new additional cover of external vibration is hiding it.
I’ll explain this by the concept of Vipassana meditation since I have been a practitioner for 15+ years. When we sit to meditate on our feelings objectively in Vipassana we first always encounter feelings on the surface of our body especially those caused by outside vibrations or stimulus like the fan running and air moving, the touch of our clothes, someone talking etc. Our mind remains outwardly focused until we can slowly focus our mind on our icy and become capable of seeing what’s going on inside. Until the outside vibrations are dominant we won’t be able to focus on our inner vibrations. This is what happens in schizophrenia. There are outside demonic forces that play with our senses- in this case our body feeling which causes our mind to focus on the outside stimulus only kit allowing us to pay attention to or be aware of our inner vibrations. This causes most schizophrenics to be not aware of their body sensations which causes them to seem to have this flat effect or monotonality of emotion.
Varying symptoms in different people-
Since every person is different and every demon is different and the capabilities and strengths vary, the harms, type and the extent of harms vary in every case- for example in some people with schizophrenia voices are not so persistent as others, in some cases it is about paranoia, in others it’s about seeing scary images etc. Some people go through a lot of torture. Some people hear voices only once in a while. Hence not every one is able to observe or deduce that there is outside interference due to demonic beings.
Paranoia and feeling of control-
The feelings of paranoia and feeling of being controlled by someone are “real” in schizophrenia. The reality is that those feelings are being generated because of the presence of demons and the harms they are causing but since people may not know this they feel a loss of trust in general because they know something is wrong but what or who is unknown. Demons help with the other part. Firstly they have access to our memories, feelings and thoughts. They can play with our feelings, images, sounds etc. Beliefs are formed because of unwholesome feelings and negative thoughts. Demons can insert negative thoughts inside us and make us fall for untrue beliefs. If you especially have mistrust with someone they can accentuate those feelings.Since they have access to human perception and cognition due to their “vicinity” this is possible.
Demons can play with our awareness and cravings and using some of the mechanisms above actually “control” our actions. They “can” make us do something. (I’ll elaborate this later.)
Why is schizophrenia found in families?
In case of schizophrenia it is found in families because demons once connected to a member of the family can connect with other members as well. They are always on the lookout. Sometimes they can connect to more than one member at a time especially if they are living together, in the same space. I know this because my demons do this all the time - at least they try very hard, I don’t know if they are successful. I know they can play with members living with the schizophrenic because there is easy physical access.
Which symptoms are psychosis/delusions and which are NOT?
You might ask me what if this whole thing is a delusion? It is not. I want to clarify what is a delusional state that people experience and what is not and why- “delusion being not being able to see reality at is”.
Hearing voices is NOT a delusion, NOT an auditory hallucination as currently believed in the medical industry. It is a REAL experience because people can hear voices while being fully aware of their present reality. How it is happening? Due to connection with another entity that has access to our mind. When two minds connect there is telepathy- communication at the mind level. Please read my answer about hearing voices here
B P's answer to How would you explain hearing voices
2. Seeing images is NOT a delusion- Many people see images while closing their eyes or see these images continuously for a long time- especially scary images, visions etc. Those are the games of the demon. Why I am saying these are not delusions because while seeing them people don’t lose their awareness. They see the image clearly, the image is being formed inside their neurological system and being fed to the eyes.
3. Feeling tactile sensations is not a delusion as explained above in the “Imagination” section. I can clearly feel the movements which are very deliberate and intentional. These movements can be easily palpable by any human being if you put your hand on the area where the patient is feeling the movement. These are not movements of my body- these are movements from outside on top of me. I can feel two types of movements-1) back and forth, up and down, pressure on body etc - these over a period of time cause pain, inflammation ne degeneration of the body part- for example my feet are harmed so much by these continuous movements that I can’t walk and have swelling 2) intentional movements intended to achieve something like feeling a hand grab me, rub on me, take some stuff from one side of my body and put in on Ian other side repetitively, sexual movements - movements done intentionally to arouse sexually, a hand pushing me or pushing stuff inside me etc. These kinds of movements are experienced by other patients of schizophrenia as well. I’ll add paper references later to this post for evidence.
4. Psychosis or Delusional states where people see things that are not there- these ARE real delusions and these happen to some people with schizophrenia which is due to presence of outside entities. These are mostly multimodal in nature involving a no of senses especially visual. It is the visual component of this that causes the losing of awareness the most. Visual illusion is always the most powerful . What is it like? Like watching a 3D movie and being in a dreamlike state- except all feels very real. But again the reason is demons only.
Here people lose awareness of themselves and start seeing things that are not present for example they may see their dead grandma sitting on a chair etc. This is a delusion although still a play of the demon. The demons are able to do multiple things since they have connection with the human mind- access images, feelings and memories. For example they can choose to bring up a childhood photograph of mine from my mind and show it to me as an image. So while I am typing this for example suddenly an image of my baby time is projected in front of me- I know my imagination is being used because it is not using my normal vision. They can also send harmful vibrations and play with your awareness, increase your cravings or aversions etc. The delusional states of seeing weird images or being in dreamlike states are created by demons by playing with all of the above. Since they have access to memory and imagination they can “create” images of our dead grandma, friends etc as well, to confuse us. That is why ppl see their dead relatives etc.
What causes delusions?
There are separate physical areas in our brain that function as imagination and reality especially in the context of eyes or seeing. The area that sees things as real is the spot right above our eyes on our forehead- the point of meditation and Ajna chakra. The imagination area is right behind it and a little above in our brain. When we imagine our eyes look there. We all know this- it’s behind this spot and a little towards the top. Try it yourself. See what is in front of you and then imagine something. You’ll see how the vision is different- one is using normal vision, one is using imagination. Maybe the focal length or where the image is formed is different in these cases. I think the presence of demons and their play connects these two areas. Due to this, what a person imagines (which is planted by the demon) “seems” real. You hear stories about a schizophrenic seeing his grandma sitting on a chair and perceiving it as real. Also the demons play with imagination a lot using it as a portal to generate and transmit images. Our mind is not able to be in the present due to this.
How can schizophrenics know that they are having delusions?
They can’t know while they are having the delusion. But the delusion ends and they realise that what they are seeing is not true. Now they see there is just an empty chair in front of them, no grandma. There is some sense in us that tells us - this is the truth. Here they are experiencing full awareness. The state of awareness is always a restful state so they go back to it sooner or later. Thus they can know that they are having delusions. You know they are experiencing awareness when they are seeing what you also see. This is just an example in context of vision. Vision plays a very important role in schizophrenia. It is tampered with the most because it can cause the most delusion. Also schizophrenics may have some special dream experiences. Demons are beings living in the field of delusion- which is the place of complete imagination, no reality. So perhaps there is a way or portal for them to connect to our imagination or dream pathways. This can be investigated- can we connect through dreams?
Schizophrenics not feeling any sensation-
The demons are able to play with human thought and feeling. Many schizophrenics have reported this and I would also validate the clear violation of physical space , people in scientific papers have reported auras entering or leaving. These are not delusions. In my case they keep inserting some substance (maybe their own gross feelings) into my physical boundary - this has a mushy and weird feel but is invisible. It slides along my body surface, suffocates me and also immediately takes all my own sensations away. For example if I was feeling pain until now suddenly the pain vanishes. In my case they have also inserted that into my body through the mouth for example. Also after the insertion is done they have control over the movement of this substance or thing etc. They use that to do movements in the body.
Understanding this needs some Vipassana knowledge-We all know that when there is a sensory stimulus to us, our mind and body system responds with a sensation in the body associated with a thought or even more complex- action. My training through Vipassana has taught me to observe this very well. When we sit to meditate we always start with gross sensations especially things we feel due to a stimulus from outside - if the fan is running in summers we feel the wind on our body. Then as we keep meditating we go deeper and start feeling our inner subtler sensations. It is the awareness of these inner sensations that keeps us vigilant about ourselves and what is happening inside us. But if the outside stimulation is a lot going inside is not possible. For example if someone keeps talking to you especially close to your ear, or there is too much visual stimulation, your eyes are open, something is scratching you- our mind can only focus on these outside things and sensations originating due to stimuli from outside.
The same principle is happening in schizophrenia - the voices, the movements, the feelings due to these insertion of outside stuff, images, etc are constantly keeping our minds focussed on the outside. Especially we are unable to feel our own internal sensations of pain, numbness, tingling, burning etc when this outside stuff is present. That is why schizophrenia patients are not able to “feel” much. They mostly feel numb. Sometimes this can also mean a complete lack of awareness of one’s condition. It is the sensations that tell us how healthy or unhealthy we are. Schizophrenics can often be wrong there not having access to most of their sensations.
In my case they have used the substance to do all kinds of movements and vibrations inside me physically that harm the body. I have injury like pain everywhere in my body- I have access to this pain sometimes. (Doctors are “appalled” to see my condition) I prefer the painful feeling to no feeling because I prefer to be aware.
Once they have physical access of you very little can be done.
(I’ll share more about this later)
Medical science-
Medical science has not reached that place where they can prove the existence of invisible beings OR if these are humans connecting remotely. Such knowledge exists in meditative observation of reality. So schizophrenia will remain unsolved for a long time unless medical science joins hands with “Mindfulness” that offers plenty when it comes to the functioning of the mind. Another things is that it is very important to take people’s symptoms seriously not writing them off under an umbrella word of “delusions” and thinking of them as folks who have lost their mind due to their own craziness or incapability. Medical science is also very “tools” and “senses” based. It only believes in what can be verified by tools or the senses. But mind is very vast and deep and beyond the senses. Observation of an aware mind must be accepted as well even if it’s a minority.
Schizophrenia is not caused by childhood trauma or abuse even though there may be connections. These are scientific research done in western countries where drugs use, broken families etc is very common. Other countries should do their own research and get their own findings. I have lived a very happy childhood and adult years and have a strong family. It maybe that your family has an “association” with demons over past years without you knowing even going back generations which can cause these issues. There is a concept of “karma by association” in Buddha’s teachings.
Spirituality is able to explain this much better because it accepts the observation by a present mind as enough validation. There is nothing “irrational” about the presence of demonic beings in the universe who may have lower minds and subtle bodies. We should look at the universe very humbly.
Power of demons-
One thing is clear - demons or these evil spirits (or even evil humans connecting remotely) are not powerful at all. They are very ignorant and pitiful. Very deceptive. They only seem powerful because they are instigated very easily and can harm for no reasons. They are only capable of very low vibrations. These beings are threatened at everything. They also have NO moral limitations.
How demons enter you?
I don’t know if it’s the demon’s body themselves that is in my space or something they are connected to that they can insert or transmit into my space. There is a invisible physical thing that moves around in my space which has a mushy feel and is used to put pressure, instill pain, on me. They can also send vibrations inside me that feel like an electric flux of burning and heat entering me from outside. It’s not the same thing as feeling neurological burning pain inside me. I am able to distinguish between when it’s a violation and when it’s not, clearly. These are termed as tactile hallucinations by the medical industry but there is nothing hallucinatory about it. Other people can feel those movements or vibrations on me too, they are easily palpable. This is the worst that can happen to you. So clearly not delusional.
Why demons connect?
Demonic nature- demons (even if these are humans who know some horrible techniques) have a “superior” life once they connect to a human like this. Their continuous feelings of hatred, aversion, wanting to harm get an object. Harm is their craving. And their craving is satisfied. They enjoy it. The demons are extremely ignorant, deceptive, and harm continuously. They also don’t eat, drink or sleep. I have experienced this personally by waking up in the night to find activity happening on me in the form of movements- these are pain inflicting movements which they do continuously until they move on to a different activity. It used to shock me earlier to see them do something continuously but not any more.They are very repetitive in their actions.
Karma- Theirs and ours- Why they connect with only some of us? We may have karma with them. According to spirituality it is possible that these beings were part of our families, social lives etc in some past life that did not end well. If you don’t believe in spirituality or past life karma then here is the other reason- we became very weak mentally or spiritually as a result of a difficult situation and our own thinking patterns and became susceptible to attack by such forms. Why I am emphasising on karma is that there are many weak and disabled humans who never encounter any evil spirits in their lifetime. It is possible that this happens because they don’t have such past karmas.
Human nature- why did it happen in my case - my observation is this- I am very idealistic in nature and don’t go for survival even in difficult situations. I stick to the good principles and doing the right thing however sometimes it’s very challenging and causes me to be in vulnerable states. I also don’t ask for help easily. I am also very accepting of the universe and all beings. So the doors are open for all. I seldom think about protecting myself and care a lot about “others”. I have realised that this mentality leads to a mental and bodily potential which makes it easy for others to enter you or affect you easily. This is not a good thing and can create circumstances for harm to come to you- so self protection is very important. The demons connected with me long time (many years) ago when I was alone, not in a good place and not doing a job, although the manifestation of the “disorder” took time.
Early signs of schizophrenia
How they connected with me and how this transpired over many years? I have written about this in another Q&A here-
Ana's answer to Can you notice if you start getting schizophrenia? What are the first symptoms you experience?
Responsibility for schizophrenia-
The responsibility for our wellness always remains ours no matter what situation it is. I want to make it clear that I am not pushing the responsibility of my own mental illness on something else like demons. The responsibility is still mine. My practice of Vipassana has taught me that my mental patterns or tendencies alone are responsible for my condition or situation. And there is karma. Clearly I wasn’t strong enough, vigilant enough or aware enough or well enough in my good times to let something like this get into my consciousness. Now I have to suffer more. But I would like people to learn from my experience and be very vigilant about themselves so such harms don’t come to them. Because once this happens the challenges multiply.
Not seeing it as a demonic problem-
There is an advantage of not seeing this as a “demons problem” because it takes away the “fear” or “panic” this would cause and keeps the responsibility to our wellness ours which is important. It also protects our false “ego”. But truly it is only our karma - our own intentions, thinking, feeling or doing, our lack of vigilance that brings us such situations.
But knowing this phenomenon as external interference helps us see the problem in true light and solve for it accurately- it should give enough clues to science about what to investigate. For example mirror neurons and the content of voices should be investigated because I think that is at the basis of how all this transpires. Accepting the external agencies also removes a lot of the stigma attached to folks with schizophrenia.
Another important thing I feel is that schizophrenia surely has something to do with how we interact with “others”. There is something weak or erroneous about that causing this problem to manifest. It may helpful to retrospect or reflect on how our interactions with others are not mindful and put us in a weaker place. Are we forgetting about ourselves when interacting with others? Are we giving too much? Are we listening too much? Are we too empathetic or socially anxious. These are indicative of a weak neurological mental barrier that is weakening us creating opportunities for such entities to connect.
Self protection is key-
We have to stay away from negative vibrations and not be in low mental states for long, alone and without support. If you are aware of your weaknesses (being too nice, pleasing others, discounting yourself, not knowing how to survive, not taking care of yourself, not able to ask for help, low self esteem etc) it is important that you start working on them early on by finding paths of self realisation like yoga or meditation practises etc or going to a therapist and using psychology as a tool or getting social support- asking for help from a friend etc). It is important that you are strong and you look strong to others so others don’t take you for granted or harm you easily. We all have to be very vigilant about our present and past karmas.
Lastly, I am asking for your compassion for those who are suffering because schizophrenia is a very complex phenomenon and is not caused by mental craziness of any kind. This can happen to very good, capable, sane and rational people who have some neurological weakness (even high anxiety) which can be true for anybody these days and which may not have manifested yet. Please do respect the experiences of people with schizophrenia. What they say they are experiencing is true. This is critical in solving this social metaphysical neurological phenomenon.
About me
I wouldn’t have believed all this myself if someone came to me 3–4 years ago and told me. I had an old aunt (dead now, blood relation) who had once told me many years ago that beings visit her, she sees and hears them etc. But I did not believe her and tried to rationalise it to her logically how it was not possible. Relatives also mostly made fun of her. My siblings also have some symptoms of this disorder. I feel like I am not a typical case of schizophrenia because I was doing extremely well in life when this misfortune suddenly hit me- they just found me in the wrong place and wrong time, living alone - enough opportunity to do harms and experiment. I know this now because they are always hunting for others while connected to me. Now going through all this and so much suffering, I have to accept this unfortunate fact. I am very unwell now physically.",schizophrenia
911,"Everyone has different symptoms when first developing schizophrenia, so my symptoms might be completely different than someone with the same diagnosis. However, I will still state what happened to me.
For the first time in my life, I was tired. I was 14 years old. Before this, I could wake up for school and stay awake. I wasn’t quite a morning person, but I had no trouble staying awake after getting out of bed. This suddenly changed. I would be in class, and my eyes would start rolling in the back of my head without me even closing my eyes. I’d have microsleeps all day despite getting a full night of sleep. It felt terrible. I was constantly exhausted no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.
My feelings toward my family suddenly changed. I felt that they were against me in some way, I’d constantly argue with them. I was always on edge around them, I was afraid they would hurt me. This fear lead to me hating them for a bit, sadly.
I developed very odd rituals. If I did not throw ice cubes into my pool, I would die. Every time I went onto my back patio, ice had to be thrown into the pool.
I loved being alone during this time. I looked forward to being home alone, but once I was actually home alone, I still felt as though there were people there. I’d walk around the house asking who was there. I looked for cameras, as I thought my parents were trying to catch me doing something I was not supposed to do. I would look up at the ceiling and say things like, “I know you’re there.” “Stop recording me, I know what you’re doing”, ect.
I had what I called my “emotion breaks”, which were little voices that would pop into my head. If they said something mean, I’d think it was my anger trying to talk to me. If they said something happy, I’d think it was my happiness trying to talk to me. I believed that my emotions had come to life in my brain, and they were talking to me.
I had very odd moments of confusion. I would be doing my normal thing, like homework, and suddenly, my brain would shift. I would very suddenly believe something very strange. For example, one time I thought that there were secret tunnels in my house that lead to the mall, I thought I had to find them to get to the mall. I would get up and look for them, wandering around my house, then I would think myself out of it. I would start having rational thoughts, like “Have I ever seen the inside of these tunnels before?” “Wouldn’t I know where the entrance was?” “I thought I got to the mall by car” Then I would realize, after a few minutes, there really aren’t any tunnels.",schizophrenia
912,"Well - my husband started this out with dark brown hair when I first got diagnosed - he’s thoroughly gray now a few years later. I know it’s been hard on him and I know he’d try to shrug it off because he’d just cite his principles, promises, and praises of how I stuck with him when he was sick.
I know it has to be frustrating when I get mentally stuck on some point or fear that makes absolutely no sense to him, but seems to be perfectly sound to me and I just won’t budge. Granted he mostly recognizes when it’s a symptom, but sometimes it’s not immediately obvious.
It has to feel like he’s walking on thin ice because my emotional regulation is virtually nonexistent. I hate that about me. It’s not as bad (in a way) when I can just fall apart and cry at like -anything- but when I get really angry and furious, well I’m just glad he forgives me - because I certainly don’t forgive me.
Part of my emotional issues are from my hallucinations, for sure. The voices are almost always there in some regard, they’re always abusive - and the worse thing is when they impersonate those that I love and say awful things. On the bad days I’ll see moving shadows, mutilated or burned rotting corpses, or demonic looking things.
I’m incredibly high maintenance. I have comorbid health issues that also require his supervision because I’m not dependable to look after my own self all of the time. While it’s been a little better over the holidays I really don’t enjoy eating anymore. I don’t enjoy the tastes like I used to. I dropped way too much weight this year (which is unusual for most people with schizophrenia), my blood pressure has been creeping back up, my renal system is subpar.
Yet for all of that others have it much worse. I’m lucky because I still have some appreciable insight and I don’t try to resist treatment. I also somehow don’t believe in the usual conspiracies- as far as I know. I do try to be as proactive as I can in living with my illness. My relapse has been frankly awful and discouraging. I feel guilty because my guy worked so hard to help me get better for a while - only for this to happen.
So I can imagine that to live with one of us is very hard, very frustrating, and can be tragic sometimes. It’s hard to keep fighting, but we will.",schizophrenia
913,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia
914,"I'm a paranoid Schizophrenic and I know myself pretty well. I've also worked with clients suffering the same disorder. Paranoids and Schizophrenics can be just like your average day Joe. Some you would never even suspect they suffered from this ilness. Most are very intelligent and will discuss things with you in depth things that will blow your mind.
These people have a mild form of schizophrenia or they have responded well to therapy and/or medication. Unfortunately there are people who don't have that response to meds or therapy. They are usually very pleasant and mild but their thought processes are different. All Schizophrenics and paranoids are different. Especially if their symptoms are active at the time you encounter them. Example; Paranoids when caught up in a delusion can be very untrusting, they will interrogate you to better understand your agenda. They may pace back and forth, chew their nails, get impatient and irritable. They may not follow your communication or ignore what you say because they are very pre-occupied with their own thoughts that may be spinning out of control.
A Schizophrenic could suddenly call 911 to report they've been robbed. Their delusions have convinced them that they own the White van parked in the neighbor's driveway and the neighbor has stollen it.
It's very hard to describe in general what paranoids and Schizophrenics are like. The symptoms are chronic. Somedays they are perfectly normal, pleasant, upbeat, intelligent, caring people. On bad days not so much.
It's my belief that we all struggle processing our emotions and the emotions of others. It's an exhausting endeavor so many of us choose not to deal with that aspect at all. This can give the impression that we are cold unemotional people. This is far from the truth. We care deeply but lack the skills to Express that in a healthy socially acceptable way. We are often misunderstood.
Hope this helps.",schizophrenia
915,"If they’re in an active episode then I would say it’s absolute complete hell. You’re living in hell and stuck in a permanent state of flight, fight, or freeze. Walking on eggshells is an understatement.
My Ex-husband’s auditory hallucinations consisted of me having sex with his best friend and the neighbor, me and other people talking shit and laughing about his insecurities, and hearing “ God “ or “spirit guides”.
They are obsessed with their hallucinations and delusions. My ex-husband started out thinking I was cheating on him with the 80 yr. old neighbor which progressed to me having sex with all the neighbors, including someone’s mom. He also believed that I was trying to kill him along with the neighbor. The neighbor could turn into a ghost and I was having sex with the ghost in my dreams. I was out to destroy him in every way. The reason I wanted him to take his antipsychotics was because they were a cover up so “ I could cheat”. When he couldn’t find a possession of his, it was because I stole it or gave it away to my “boyfriend”.
After about a year or so of this, religious hallucinations and delusions were also added into the mix. I was possessed and I put a hex or a curse on him. I cursed his manhood size so we couldn’t have sex and I made him walk with a limp.
He would randomly do religious fasting and salt baths. He would pray super loud and do it obsessively all day and all night. When he was really into it, he’d speak in “tongues”. He became convinced that he was a prophet and could send people to hell.
This consumed his life which consumed everyone’s life in the home. There was NEVER a moment of peace and silence. I would be kept up for multiple nights in a row because he didn’t want me to go to sleep and “cheat” with the “demon neighbor” in my dreams.
During the day it was being slut shamed or being drilled the same 5 questions every 5 min. throughout the day. Can’t deny or confirm any delusions because it can make it turn from torture to outright dangerous. As a way to cope with hearing voices, he would blare rap music as loud as it would go and NEVER turned it off. Anytime I hear that type of music, I’m triggered and flip out.
THEN you gotta throw in the nights of smoking meth and drinking alcohol. He (according to the cops, legally) bought a gun to protect himself from the “neighbor” and I. Guess red flag laws don’t apply in TN. He smoked meth because it gave him more powerful “powers”… a.k.a. auditory and visual hallucinations. Seeing the “ghost neighbor” in the house and having super strength “hearing”.
So, it was complete hell and torture for 3 years straight. It started during the height of COVID and to make matters worse, we had 2 young children in the home. All mental health crisis services were shut down. Any restraining orders that ended up in place didn’t matter because he always ended back up in our home somehow. The cops told me to stop calling them for help. A mental health hospital he was discharged from called an Uber for him and gave them my address despite knowing there was a no contact order in place because he threatened me. When I called them crying they told me “ all you have to do to get him back in here is call 911 and request an ambulance.” LIES. I failed all my exams the same day and failed all classes. DCS had been involved at one point and although they were super nice, they had 0 resources for me due to Covid shutting everything down and closed the case out. The only advice they gave me was to get a restraining order. Which I already had.
His mom would continually drop him off at our home because she didn’t want to deal with him. My kids and I had nowhere safe we could go and no way to get him out of the home and keep him out.
I’m not sure how I never experienced stress induced psychosis other than God watching over me. I did however end up detached emotionally from everyone including my children. I was diagnosed with PTSD. My kids were also traumatized although they were asleep for the majority of the worst, which always happened at night time. Although they weren’t at the receiving end of it, they experienced things they shouldn’t have and felt my terror and stress.
I was able to find a way out of the mess once he ended up in jail for several months and resources became available. It took several weeks for me to even process and gain the mental clarity I needed to begin rebuilding my life. Despite years of therapy, I’m still emotionally detached and unable to experience happiness.

916,"I’ve had prodromal symptoms for about 5 years. Sometimes I thought people talk behind my back - stuff like that I’m gay or weird. I had problems relating to others. That’s why I was immersed in personal development and was kind of self help junkie. Sometimes I saw connections everywhere, like the traffic sign STOP would mean sth to me. Like to stop thinking about sth or stop talking about what I was talking about.
I had a lot of insecurities and a lot of energy to work on myself. I was going to the gym, had long morning rituals, meditated and read a lot of books. But somehow, I wasn't able to help myself. Anxiety was with me wherever I went. I was also very angry at my parents as I thought I have these problems because of them.
One day when I got home from my work I just stopped working on myself. It was the first time in 5 years I didn’t have the urge to fix something. That night I started hearing my neighbours talking how I’m gay and how I should go out and find a girl or they will not stop talking through the wall. I went out in the middle of the night searching for a girl to prove them wrong. When I got home I heard them again. Like they were mumbling something how I’m uncapable to find a woman for myself. Something was wrong. It was going worse and worse and after 10 days I was in mental hospital. I was there for 2 months.
My point is - it just erupted in my life. Nobody thought something was wrong with me, only me. I sensed deep in myself that something is missing and that I’m not a person I should be. For 5 years!",schizophrenia
917,"I have wanted the answer to this question for years.
My relative is schizophrenic and was diagnosed around the age of twenty. The symptoms of this illness are known but they vary in the way they present, and can be different in one person compared to another. In my relatives case she was medicated and would go many years between severe episodes where she required hospitalisation. She would be sorted over the next few weeks, sometimes with new medication, and would go home. Rinse and repeat for forty years.
I wanted to know how this illness would progress so started reading everything I could find on the matter, Most things online are written by doctors for other doctors, so the terminology makes it unreadable for the average Joe like me. Forums seemed to talk mostly about younger sufferers.
I finally saw a medical doctor saying that (during training) he had been taught that outcomes could be spit into three. One third of patients will die before they get old, from suicide, lack of caring for themselves, other diseases or living on the streets, etc. One third of patients will improve in some measurable way, and one third will get progressively worse as they age.
Sadly my relative has fallen into the last category. She now seems in a permanent state of psychosis, although most of the time it is not too severe and she still lives independantly with care. However, it means that she has cut off her family completely, which is tragic for her elderly parents who have always supported her, despite some of the very nasty things their daughter has said and done to them (which she can’t help it is just the illness).
In my opinion the progression of the disease is different depending on the patient. I don’t know if menopause plays a part in women (it seemed that way for my relative but that could be coincidental), and there could be other family or environmental factors at play. However, one thing I do think is that someone with a brain disorder, who has to take long term medication that ‘balances’ the brain for over forty years, may have an adverse affect from that long term use. I am not blaming the medication, it is necessary, but it doesn’t seem too far fetched that drugs that affect the brain could have a long term affect on the brain.
Just my thoughts and experience.",schizophrenia
918,"I wish this was a good question, here’s why it’s not. Two things need to be separated; the diagnosis, and the treatment. So, to get to the answer of your question let’s start with the diagnosis; #1. There is no objective test. As a therapist, I can see absolutely anyone for six months and then diagnose them with “schizophrenia”. #2. No psychiatric diagnosis can be substantiated in science, and this is why former NIMH Director Thomas Insel wrote, “Psychiatric diagnoses are reliable but not valid”. #3. In the words of Dr. Loren Mosher, who was Director of Schizophrenia Research at NIMH, “brain diseases belong to Neurology”. What’s my point here? If you want to measure something, first you have to find it. To the second issue of treatment, here’s where we get your answer; #1. psychiatric drugs are taking twenty plus years off the life spans of patients. This is something we actually can measure because in 1954, when the first psych drug (Thorazine) came to market, life spans of people with severe mental illnesses (smi) were exactly the same as the general population. #2. Psychiatric drugs do not treat anything because there are no known pathologies in Psychiatry, as we discussed earlier. #3. The drugs purported to “treat” schizophrenia, neuroleptics, shrink the frontal lobe and enlarge the basal ganglia (Grace Jackson MD). So we have your answer, I believe. The drugs are killing people diagnosed with so-called schizophrenia while we all sit by and instead of saying, “This is genocide”, we say, “The schizophrenia is getting worse”. Meanwhile, in countries/locales which embrace reality, people are not being put on those drugs (except for sleep restoration temporarily), and people are recovering at an over eighty percent rate.",schizophrenia
919,"No.
The statistics (and my clinical experience) show that the delusional thinking and hallucinations tend to remit over time. The patients remained impaired, however, and (mostly) remained in need of continued financial and personal assistance.
That people with schizophrenia have diminished “positive” symptoms (hallucinations/delusions) and yet remain disabled illustrates a very common misperception: hallucinations and delusions are the symptoms that most interfere in patient functioning.
The real, most persisting, life impairing, and untreatable symptom in schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction. Libraries could be devoted to the various cognitive impairments these people may experience.
As far as I know, no treatments for cognitive dysfunction that help beyond the very minimal are available.",schizophrenia
920,"I have a theory.
It's only spoken out of experience with this mind state, and clearly not backed by any research.
People that we surround ourselves with. The more people we try and interact with, the worse our paranoia is. The more we attempt relationships, the more delusional we get.
Some people in this world aren't harmful to our mind, but most are. I'm not speaking on the ""bad"" and ""good"" in people, but their actions and how it affects our mind.
If someone asks me too many questions, I will get paranoid. If someone speaks about me when I'm not around, whether it be good or bad things, I will likely have auditory hallucinations. If I have social media, or any sort..I will likely have a reserved hatred toward everyone. If someone looks my way at the grocery store, I will look over my shoulder until I get home. If someone even smiles at me or acts as if they are interested in me, I will think they are plotting against me.
And so on.
It's the people around us that make us progressively worse over time. Any person, all people. I am more concerned with the guy that held the door open for me at the gas station than the boy that committed the mass shooting in Florida. Yep, I said it. It doesn't make sense to you, I know, but it does to me.
As we get older, we experience more people and more surroundings…catch my drift?
Sure, blame the medication or lack of. I'll blame the people.
I'll say one thing for sure; the only reason I'm able to have a stable job working long hours is because I don't have to be social during those hours. I don't have anxiety when I get home because I live and hang out with my dog when I get off work and no one else. I don't go shopping, I don't have social media, I don't have friends, I rarely attend any family function and I don't go out to bars and shit. I used to….now I'm asocial, I feel better now than I did before.",schizophrenia
921,"The old name of schizophrenia was dementia praecox, which means early dementia. Emil Kraepelin believed, it was a variety of Alzheimer disease. Most schizophrenics get worse with age, because with every new episode, the disease “eats” their brain - they lose gray and white matter in various regions(especially cortex, brain ventriculi etc) more and more with every new episode and get worse.
And yes, some are lucky and their situation does not get worse. These are, who take their medication, who have late onset schizophrenia(after age of 45 years), whose negative symptoms are not so expressed.",schizophrenia
922,"I have a limited perspective on this question, I am not a professional, however I have been in many support groups. I have dealt with my brother in this condition for the last 30 years, so that is where I am coming from. One person does not make a good sample population, but this is what I have to say:
The answer is ""sort of both"", and it depends how you define ""better"". Sorry this is so long.
There are so many other points that generalizations would be difficult.
- schizophrenia, as time goes on (and I am talking in decades, and years) goes up and down, there are spans of 3,4,7 good years and spans of bad years. In My experience as time goes on these stretch to a few ""good or bag months"" when in the 20's to a few good or bad years when in the 40's.
- If the sufferer is on (legal) drugs, you have another factor to deal with, if the drug is helping as time goes on the sufferer will be able to do more with the drugs, however if they stop, or the drugs stop working so well (if you see the prescription dosage go up to maintain the same effects, that is an issue), you go in the opposite direction, fast.
- If the sufferer is on (illegal) drugs/booze, you have another factor to deal with, not
counting overdose and dealers that could take advantage of the sufferer, you have the switching from whiskey to pot to crack to what ever, that is a wildcard that no one can predict. I have heard that being 420 friendly helps them control the thoughts, or perhaps drowns them out with other ones... I do not know, but it is a part of most schizophrenics' lives, I have found it best to be tolerant, that way you know what is going on rather than arguing for them to stop and you being in the dark.
- If you are dealing with someone in and out of the hospital, you are going to be bouncing a lot.
- Eventually schizophrenia, and alzheimer's can look very similar (or at least require the same treatment), so getting older, older may be simpler to deal with.
- And as people get older (50+) the drugs affect their body differently, so that could be bad.
- Over time the family (if in a supportive environment and getting help from groups like NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness ) they will have less stress/concern/worry over the condition and that is better... and since the sufferer (usually) does not think they have a problem, it is the caregiver's perspective that you measure ""better"" or ""worse"", so perhaps it is more of how YOU see and feel about the issue, rather than what the issue is or what the sufferer is feeling. (sorry, that may be too deep)
Let me know in the comments if this answered your question.",schizophrenia
923,"My understanding is that, unlike many mental illnesses, schizophrenia is a progressive disease. In bipolar disorder, for instance, the person may experience a depression which could profoundly interrupt their ability to function but afterward they will be able to return to their previous baseline level of functioning. While each episode could get progressively worse, the in between episodes ability to function isn't necessarily going to decline.
With schizophrenia, however, the psychotic episode decreases their level of functioning and even though they might resolve that particular episode their baseline level of functioning will not return to where it was, it will decrease with each successive episode.",schizophrenia
924,"I'm schizoaffective. In my case, that means I have symptoms of both usually at the same time.
I honestly don't know which is worse. During Mania I'd do drugs, gamble, have sex with anything that would lay down with me, waste tons of money, or go into fits of rage, hurt others for no reason or perceived slight, get into fights (and so on it goes) I've started so many projects while riding a manic high. (For me it feels really really great during a mania. Better than drugs. Better than sex. ) and I have major depression.
On the schizophrenia side I have a flat affect except during mania, minor audio hallucinations, occasional delusions (these bother me more than anything else), vocalized poverty of speech (I write leagues better than I talk), paranoia semi frequently, anhedonia, listlessness, and being extremely slow (doing anything and everything) listlessness and frequent insomnia.
All of these symptoms would manifest in no particular order at no particular grouping (the bipolar is cyclic). I take drugs for my mania, depression, and I take antipsychotics for the schizophrenia. So I don't go into a mania any more though I can physically feel when my body would be going into a manic episode (for me it's kinda like that feeling before orgasm except now it just stops there for a few days).
As I understand it, having both means it's not as extreme as having one or the other. It really depends on the severity. I rarely hallucinate visually for example. Ultimately, I couldn't guess which is worse

925,"It does not, necessarily, if the patient is well cared for in the community, by a family network or even in a hospital or special hospital, receiving carefully prescribed medication, eating a healthy diet and leading a fulfilling life, for example getting plenty of exercise and outdoor time as well as obviously doing fulfilling things indoors be it whatever like watching television, reading, cooking, listening and making music as well as catching up with friends and getting the chance to meet new people - you know the sort of things that any average person need to do have a fulfilling, enjoyable life. I have insight as if not well looked after by an excellent psychiatrist I could well have been diagnosed with one of the schizophrenias. I can tell you that any psychosis that requires inpatient hospital treatment is no laughing matter and you wouldn't even wish upon your worst enemy. Obviously I cannot compare it to delirium.",schizophrenia
926,"What I was taught in residency was the rule of 1/3.
1/3 of newly diagnosed schizophrenics will have symptoms that remain stable. Another 1/3, symptoms would die out or improve over time. And the last 1/3 would have worsening symptoms year after year.
I really do not know if that 1/3 rule is correct or not.
However through clinical practice I know that the age of onset matters a lot.
The earlier the age of onset (say 16 years old and even earlier in childhood), the worse the long term prognosis is, which means the worse the psychotic sysmptoms are.
On the other hand the latter the age of onset, the better the prognosis is and the milder the symptoms are.
I have had three people with onset of schizophrenia in their thirties where they responded to low dose antipsychotics and I was able to taper two of them off their antipsychotics without the return of symptoms.
However my patients’ whose schizophrenia onset is in their early 20’s, they don’t have such luck. It is not due to lack of trying. I have tried to taper them off their medications at their requests but psychosis almost always comes back once the dosage gets too low.",schizophrenia
927,"Experience teaches me contrarily- for i have seen many people recover and successfully rehabilitate from schizophrenia. I surmise from that that the management of the symptoms is the most important consideration, which determines whether people would get or worse.
Suppose someone suffers due to environmental factors, if that environment is not changed, they will only worsen with time. This is especially true in families where what is called EXPRESSED EMOTION is very high- and one person is routinely criticizing another, is control oriented and dominant. The person who is criticized, controlled and constantly the butt of ridicule, rejection or scrutiny will only recede into an inner shell.
To look at schizophrenia one needs to look very closely at family environments. This was done by R.D.Laing long back in England and he studied families over a long span of time- unfortunately he died before publishing the results of his studies, but there are many more studies now.
In families that are supportive, symptoms may diminish or even disappear. It is all about who is helping whom and how. But yes, the most supportive families bring the best outcomes and recovery. My own studies confirm that. Naturally the whole system needs to be helped and supported by outsiders, as and when required.",schizophrenia

Men usually have more schizophrenia symptoms than women which suggests estrogen protects women, the friend I mentioned above has a brother who has more severe symptoms
there really should be more research into this
Its different for bipolar disorder and women - as estrogen decreases at menopause so do manic episodes - this was the case with my sister she hadn’t been manic for a few years but she was feeling a bit off her GP told her she was on the menopause and put her on HRT which was like rocket fuel for her bipolar disorder she went really manic

931,"My mother was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder later in life, which is in the same family as schizophrenia. In fact, she was only diagnosed because her symptoms got so bad that the neighbors called the police on her, and they transported her to the hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
It’s worth noting that when you don’t cooperate with treatment and are involuntarily hospitalized, you don’t get an optimal diagnosis. Schizophrenia can take observational skills to diagnose, and the luxury of time is absent once a patient arrives at the psychiatric ward in the midst of a psychotic episode.
For this reason, my mother was originally diagnosed as psychotic NOS. She was re-hospitalized at a later date, again involuntarily, with a deputy driving her from a campground to rural hospital. In that psychiatric ward, she was reevaluated, again under duress, and labeled with schizoaffective disorder. Through subsequent involuntary hospitalizations, that diagnosis stuck.
Even if her symptoms abated over time, which is questionable, she was so bothersome to deal with (because she practically harassed people everywhere she went), that she required medication to subsist in society.
Toward the end of her life, she was in a retirement home. I received a call from a psychiatrist at the hospital where she was being treated. This doctor told me that for the elderly, it was appropriate to reduce medication levels. He mentioned her levels had already been reduced, which I didn’t question at the time. In fact, as her conservator, I should have been in the loop. She was always arguing with doctors to reduce her meds, but the problems resurfaced every time she did.
So now in her elderly years, her psychiatric medications were greatly reduced. Because I was not kept in the loop by her retirement home or doctors, I was not aware that she started refusing to take all her other meds, claiming they were poisoning her. As a result of this, she died.
The end result of my mother’s symptoms mellowing with age could have been deceptive as this encouraged her doctors to reduce her medications. This in turn allowed her psychosis to resurface enough to increase her paranoia to a point that endangered her life.
On a final note, even if the symptoms of schizophrenia do abate over time, the danger of the illness is ever present and should never be minimized.",schizophrenia

933,"There is no simple answer to this, but as someone whose mental illness escalated abruptly in their mid-twenties, I've had a lot of time to consider it. My illness is not schizophrenia, but I believe that some of the developmental issues are similar.
Early to mid 20s is the time in life when a person is really cut loose from their family and expected to fly solo. In college and before that, you have family ties, people controlling your behavior, school structure, dorm rules. It's my belief that flying without a net can cause a cascade of stressors and issues that tip a person who is headed toward psychiatric issues into full blown problems.
Take food and sleep, as examples. In college, a forced structure keeps a young adult on some kind of regular schedule, even if it's unconventional. Meal plans and social eating keep them from starving.
When we move out on our own and really try to cope on our own, it can be easy to lose track of those systems and schedules. The more we lose that connection to others - eating together, sleeping at the same times, being social at the same times - the easier it is to become disconnected from other people and feel cut loose and unstable.
I'm relatively certain there's a chemical issue at play too - some part of our developing brains, or some issue with ongoing stress wreaking havoc on our chemistry. But I think the mid 20s issues are as much social and structural as they are chemical.
You look at the 27 club (musicians and artists who died at 27) and I think honestly that has more to do with a dramatic crash in their mid twenties turning to utter self destruction in their late twenties than any curse. I only wish most of them had people to support them instead of praise them and get out of their way. We might have a few of them still.",schizophrenia

My family and church had some weird ideas about me to begin with, but I took what they said and ran. I discovered that God, angels and demons could talk to me. They were trying to teach me a new language based more on conceptual thinking.
Along with that, I had bad negative symptoms. No energy, isolating,never wanting to do anything, no interest in anything, flat affect, out of place emotions, and I was a complete slob.
Also, I was raised in long term reaidential treatment centers, so I was watched constantly, and assessed and judged. That's just a fact.

936,"Not necessarily but possibly. It can definitely get worse without participating in treatment. Additionally I have witnessed individauls get progressively worse when they stop treatment, get hospitalized, and subsequently are discharged at a lower level of functioning than before the previous decompensation. However, each person diagnosed with such a disorder is an individual and treatment and prognosis is always case specific. I have seen individuals with schizophrenia have symptoms that have gone partially or completely into remission both with and without treatment compliance.",schizophrenia
937,"It affects people in different ways. Many people do not know they have the disorder, and even these people may lose insight. We tend to be odd, even before the formal disease hits. We were the loners and usually get noticed for inattention at first. This makes people get the wrong diagnosis. You will look like you have ADHD, which is what happened to me. I cycled all the way around my city and would periodically run or start jumping until I could calm down, which wasn’t easy, especially since I spent years without a bedtime schedule. My home left was not healthy. My family had a lot of bad things happen. The army didn’t help. I know I must have been noticed for my exercise routine at night, running on the track at all hours, going up and down the stairs, sprinting and walking around the entire base, and I still don’t know why they didn’t get rid of me then. They wanted a show.
We had bad times while this developed. And yes, the people you live with, and even animals, will sometimes start to think like you or have personal demons come out by your cues, even when they turn fictional. My animals helped me. I had a very dedicated cat when I was alone and didn’t know what was going on. He guarded me.
Another problem is that the disease will make you retarded or slow you down on top of inattention. Having too much dopamine in your brain will cause that hyperreaction to things and not be able to stop. They won’t make sense, but you’ll focus on them. You will unhook from your normal emotions —and I don’t mean the head injury that I have, and have the wrong reactions. Some of us fight during this phase like I did.
And don’t believe all the hype about medicine regrowing neurons. I believe that the medicine helps you develop new and stronger paths in your brain, positive ones. The medications aren’t pleasant. Yes, I take them.

But it is complex. I need more understanding to be more logical, rational and such in my own thinking, and when i discuss it with others etc..
But for me to almost have cured myself is arround 4 years.
That which now is my focus is to become more intellectual and get my memory to work better, so i can speak with people, and help people sort things out, while i also sort out myself, giving my input to people, while they get their treatment they feel is needed by talking to their doctors, therapists, psychologists, shrinks etc.
Some need to talk to shrink, to therapists, psychologist, familly, friends, etc, and some need medication, if they choose to do so because they see it if it helps through having been given the meds from the professionals. But if they choose to not use meds (like me) and or not to use the professionals (like me) is up to themselves, because everyone react differently to different medicine or advice and stuff. Because there is different approaches and such (which is good) from different types of clinics, with their own ways etc)) But if patient feel that he/she dont need meds, it is from their own conviction that they do so because of their experience with the meds.

A 2013 study from Lund University in Sweden revealed that the average life expectancy of men and women with schizophrenia is 15 years and 12 years shorter respectively than for those who do not suffer from the disease.
A study in 2016 confirmed that people with schizophrenia have a significantly diminished life span with a death rate being more than 25 years earlier than the general population without schizophrenia.
This can be attributed to Cognitive functioning worsenIng in older schizophrenia patients who have a history of poor functioning as they age.

941,"Q: What is the life span of a person with schizophrenia?
In general, people with schizophrenia live 15-25 years less than the general population, due mainly from co-morbid acute chronic conditions, like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancers from smoking.
Other causes, especially for medication non-compliance, can be from violence, effects of alcoholism and drugs (self-medication), homelessness, self-harm, as Christi Nelms has mentioned partly in her answer. There is also a high mortality rate from suicide, especially amongst pre-diagnosis and near post-diagnosis young males.
You don’t die from schizophrenia, but from the effects of neglect of your physical health.

943,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
944,"Marcus Romme wrote living with voices, i think. It is a book about people who gain distracting voices but lose them. I looked for a shelter for my sick brother in knoxville, and one of the schizophrenics who joined the christian shelter got a job, took his meds, stayed clean and feels recovered and healthy. There is a rainbow. God will usually help. I went sober and read the bible and take medication. I add herbs like ashwagandha to fight bad dreams and stress.

945,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
946,"The average duration of schizophrenia is 15-25 years. However, it can last for much longer or shorter, depending on the individual.
Some people with schizophrenia experience a single episode that never recurs. Others experience multiple episodes that can last for weeks, months, or even years.
The course of schizophrenia is often unpredictable. There may be periods of remission (when symptoms are absent or minimal) followed by periods of relapse (when symptoms return).
Schizophrenia can be a chronic condition, but it is not necessarily a terminal one. With treatment, many people with schizophrenia can live long and productive lives.
Some factors that can affect the course of schizophrenia:
Age of onset. Schizophrenia typically develops in people between the ages of 16 and 30. Those who develop schizophrenia at a younger age tend to have a more severe and chronic course of illness.
Genetics. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that is influenced by both genetics and environment. People with a family history of schizophrenia are at an increased risk of developing the disorder themselves.
Substance abuse. People with schizophrenia who abuse drugs or alcohol are more likely to have a poorer course of illness.
Treatment adherence. People with schizophrenia who do not adhere to their treatment plan are more likely to have relapses.",schizophrenia
947,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.

After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.
Best wishes to all.",schizophrenia
948,"As one living with schizophrenia, I can tell you it is a lonely life. I tend to isolate a lot so I am certain when I go into hallucination mode that I am really having hallucinations and I am not hearing ""real"" voices or seeing things (like rats climbing the walls).
I know isolating isn't the answer, and I give every effort to have a social life. For example, two months ago I went to see a real movie for the first time in 35 years. I had an understanding friend with me, and that made all the difference. It's just something about being in an enclosed space with lots of people in almost total darkness.
I have been in therapy for most of my life, and am taking medications as prescribed. I have finally found a great therapist and excellent psychiatrist who have saved my life several times over.
With that background info, to more directly answer your question as to the complications of schizophrenia would include:
Financial ruin (I have been bankrupt three times);
Social awkwardness to the point of having only one or two friends at any time. both of whom understand my condition as best they can; and
A very short life span. I am not expected to live past 60 years of age, because current medications are so toxic if taken long enough.",schizophrenia
949,"If schizophrenia not treated then you can't be functional you will be forced to live alone.
You will not be able to continue job as it requires confronting peoples
You will not be able to have trust to even your family members so leading a married life is also not possible.
Life will become useless as voices in your head will totally consume you.
You will be forever immerse in your own visualised world. Its like day dreaming. Thoughts will come to life. its like living in your own world in your head doing whatever you want but only imaginary. People also have imaginary friends they talk to themselves whole day.

950,"Men with schizophrenia die on average 10 years earlier and women die 12 years earlier than those who do not have schizophrenia.
Much of this premature mortality is due to lifestyle. That is, people with schizophrenia are less likely to see physicians for routine physical exams or seek treatment for medical issues, less likely to get vaccinations, less likely to see dentists. There is a high rate of substance abuse (40% to 60%) among those with this illness.
The good news is that those in regular contact with psychiatrists or therapists fare somewhat better.",schizophrenia

952,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia

Nne of them have suffered from Schizophrenia.
None of them have medical degree to even comment on this illness.

Now coming to your question. Yes it can be cured to an extent that no medicine will be required and symptoms won't come back.
I had battled with this illness for 10 years. My first symptom appeared in 2014. Started taking medicines in 2018. Here comes 2024 and with the consultation of medical team I am now completely off from medicines.
Tips:-
Follow up timely with your doctor
Take medicines religiously. There is a new medicine in market “Cariprazine”. It worked wonders for me. It has close to zero side effects.
Practice physical exercise. It release HOPE harmones. They are natural anti-depressents
Some issues still remains in me like fear of unkown, but with time they will go as I was in a zone of constant gaurd for a decade.

954,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
955,"Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness characterized by biochemical and sometimes structural abnormalities in the brain. The illness is often diagnosed during the late teenage years. It is a psychotic disorder, which means that the patient is subject to delusions, hallucinations and paranoia. The primary symptom is lack of insight. While suffering a psychotic episode, the patient does not know he is sick and must rely on other people to get him the help he needs. While this is a heartbreaking health problem, proper medication and therapy can provide years of relief. Working with a psychiatrist to find the right combination of medications is of utmost importance. Sometimes, the medication will cause difficult side effects. However, there are many options available, since everybody’s brain is different. That is why it is very important to find a doctor the patient trusts and work together to get the right combination of medications to aid recovery. Like anybody else, a healthy diet, exercise, avoidance of street drugs and excessive alcohol are important.",schizophrenia
956,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
957,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
958,"There is no known cure for schizophrenia.
The best that we can hope for, is effective symptom management…and sometimes periods of symptom remission. Both of those are considered a great victory.
Why hasn’t there been a cure for schizophrenia? Advocacy.
Schizophrenia affects about 1 in 100 people….yet, the people affected are also the least able to advocate for their own care, treatments or cures.
They are not like Breast Cancer where the victim is often able to advocate, or Autism (that have active parental involvement). People with schizophrenia are often the most compromised, people who are often forgotten, who families sometimes abandon, and who often have very few people actively in their corner.
It breaks my heart.
People with schizophrenia grow up much like you and I. They have dreams, hopes, things they want for their life….and often (not always), these things are stolen from them in the most terrible of ways, and they are left to fend for themselves at a time when they are most compromised in their abilities.

959,"No.
When schizophrenia first manifests, there is quite possibly no way to keep it under control from the get go.
Medication is a necessity, unfortunately (at this stage).
But, it is not unheard of for schizophrenics, bipolars, depressives etc. To come off medication later on in life and have it under control.
It requires time, dedication, control. It’s not possible for everyone.
The symptoms will still be there.
Schizophrenics will still see and hear things.
Bipolars will still have mood swings.
But the person will be centred, and be able to control the symptoms so as to not let them interfere with day to day life.

961,"I have schizophrenia. It was undiagnosed and untreated for nine years.
When I woke in the mornings the room would be a funny grey color. Everything looked ‘wrong', like berries from the supermarket that are starting to rot. I would walk outside and see imaginary graves all around me, all the people and animals I'd ever loved.
I thought I was watched constantly. Going to the bathroom, working, making dinner. Someone was always watching me. Voices in my head never ceased. Usually they were the voices of people I loved, but instead of loving me back they would say insulting, belittling things.
The only way I could make the voices stop was to scream, yell, and howl louder than them. No amount of alcohol made them stop: they would follow me into unconsciousness. Because I heard them criticizing all the time, when the real person appeared I thought it was all true, that it was really them talking. My confusion was infinite. My delusional thinking was infinite.
During bad psychotic episodes, the yelling and screaming were so extreme that I would stuff a rag in my mouth and put on my motorcycle helmet and hide in a closet to try to muffle my own voice. Then came hallucinations. After the screaming and the hallucinations, catatonia set in, and I'd stand in one place, mouth hanging open, for long periods of time. This happened frequently.
I slept three hours a night, on average.
A great deal of the time I was unable to speak, unable to make decisions, unable to look up or make eye contact, unable to touch anyone or bear being touched, unable to start any activity, unable to read, unable to speak on a phone, unable to watch TV or use a computer. Aka, ‘negative symptoms’.
And I was considered ‘high functioning’.
I have now been sane for four years and 5 months. I do not take pharmaceutical antipsychotics.
I take 2500 mg a day of full spectrum CBD oil, which is an antipsychotic proven to be equal to, or surpassing, many pharmaceutical antipsychotics. With no side effects. There are many research studies from the last decade showing the antipsychotic effects of cbd, but you have to dig deep to find them. Much research is internatonal, due to US restrictions.
I also take 180 mg a day of Famotidine (aka pepcid ac, a histamine 2 blocker which happens to control the negative symptoms of schizophrenia).
This combination has no side effects for me, except that my back pain and arthritis have improved and I sleep 7 hours a night.
I would not return to a life of untreated schizophrenia. I cannot imagine anyone would. It is the definition of hell.
Thanks for asking this question.",schizophrenia
962,"Most definitely as I am a living example!
I got sick with schizophrenia three years ago and I stopped taking medicine for over a two years now without any complications. I lead a normal life other than hearing voices. Most people I know dont know that I have schizophrenia till I tell them. In my own opinion schizophrenia is not treated properly and thus is why many seek too try and snuff it out with medicine. I think a new approach should be utilized when dealing with this and hope that people will open there minds to the possibilities
Here is my little story of my journey with schizophrenia. So in 2019 I started hearing voices. Several horrible, atrocious voices of what sounded like a few men and women speaking to me from a far distance. At first I was confused and bewildered by the omission presence of the nameless voices. I didn't quite understand what was going on. So I spoke to them to try to gain a understanding of the disturbance. For me I once I heard them they never went away. On our of meds there always just there chatting away. No matter where I went I could hear them. Who wouldn't be scared 😨. This was my main reason for freaking out. But I had to buckle up for it's going to be a wild ride.
My first mistake when I heard them was to to communicate back. That a downward spiral which will wind up with in a tick to the mental ward. If thats where you need to go to cool down. Then by all means. I was sent there 10 times in the first year I was sick. O' boy it sure was dark times. But I survive. Once I understand stood the basic rules of schizophrenia. Here is my brack down of the do's and don't.
Do Listen to music! Like all the time. I sleep and live my entire life with a ear phone in one ear playing music. I recommend fantasy instrumental. I prefer instrumental in general. Though I do change it up time to time. Instrumental is great because there is no words. For me a least it makes me unable to understand what the voices are saying.
Do participate in peer support! I found this quite helpful and healing. Because peers do have a better understanding of life with a mental illness. Even if it may not be the illness that is the same.
Do Learn new things! I wrote a book on my second year of having schizophrenia and that helped me articulated my thoughts and express what I thought of this strange illness. Also I am learning Japanese. Guess what… the voices what ever they might be do have a level of intelligence and will also lean new languages if the person with it does as well. So weird right.
Do go outside and enjoy the world! Yes it hard when the voices say horrible stuff a make it difficult to leave. Though this is something that will take time, but it worth it.
Do Enjoy life! Love, feel and be you. Sure it's likely no one will completely understand what you are going through. But you will probably never completely understand what anyone but you is going through too. That's just the way it is. Be brave and kind to many and try again each day. There are many more do's I freaking wrote a book about this illness. Though this is not the place to read all of it. So I will now write about the don'ts
Don't believe in everything! Belief is powerful. The mind can be driven mad quite easily by simply believing in things. Belief has caused real massacres to transpire. It powerful and takes hold. Belief is the basics of getting brainwashed. So be overly skeptical 🧐. Don't yilled to fear of the not proven or unknown.
Don't communicate with the voice! What I mean is in anyway verbally and mentally, It's a trap and will drive one mad. Though if you do go mad you call always pull your self out if willing. I was in the deeps of madness and broke through to awareness.
Don't do what they tell you! Be a rebel and don't give the voice any power over you. Try to block out what they say with either music or TV. In the three years I have had schizophrenia they have never gone completely silent. Even with medicine. I will admit I did do a few things they said at first. Till I realized that is very dangerous and will cost me. Also I don't do what most tell me anyways so yah. They yell a lot but I am just going to ignore like a bad date.
Don't give up! Life is life. The good, bad, beautiful, bazaar and brilliance of life. Some point will be amazin and some will not. Though I have come to realize that my view only improves with how I decide to ride the wave. Some days I barely say afloat. While others I am cruising along. There have been ponts that I needed to be saved. Don't fret for there is more ahead.
I may have rambled a bit here and there. Well I just wanted to say that not taking medicine is ok. I am just fine I haven't been hospitalized since I quit the meds and haven't had a single episode. With the methods I use to cope with the madness have I achieved the awareness to steer my ship where ever I please.",schizophrenia
963,"Yes it can! I’m living proof and don’t believe the doctors and nay-sayers that claim its permanent. its no different than any other illness out there. The real question is are you willing to change and do the WORK required to heal. This is where most ppl fail short, because they don’t want to commit to change.
The main things that must change are DIET. You have to eliminate junk foods, clear the gut, clear heavy metals, toxins, parasites, and irritants that could be contributing to irrational thought processes and behaviors.
Then there is the MIND. Can you switch your perspective? Are you always seeing the worst in everything? The mind will need a heavy duty overhaul in retraining and rewiring new thought beliefs and perspectives into form. This is something that most ppl on the planet need so don’t feel down or bad about it. All of us have been programmed to be negative until we see how that doesn’t bring any happiness to our lives.
Then there is Emotional body. Most schizophrenias are dealing with trauma that’s unresolved and many are stuck in flight or fight mood unable to move forward in their lives. This also gives astral parasites an opportunity to manipulate consciousness in people that are already depressed or have weaken boundaries and mental strength. You have to learn coping practices to decrease stress, build boundaries, calm the vagus nerve of the brain and relax the nervous system. Mindfulness, meditation, coping techniques to deal with emotions effectively are necessary.
Natural healing is possible but takes time and dedication like anything else. If you would like support from someone that has actually lived through this and overcame it, feel free to reach out and I will help you the best that I can. I want others to just heal and spread the healing that this can be naturally cured to others as well. :)",schizophrenia
964,"No, unfortunately it can not. I wish it could. Schizophrenia is a brain based illness that involves neurotransmitters to over fire and under fire. There are specific medications that help with this.A psychiatrist would give you a full evaluation and based on that , they would prescribe accordingly.
There are environmental stress related factors that can make a person's symptoms worse or cause an unwanted subsequent episode.
Here are a few suggestions for management that you can do.
Keep stress low. Manage all types. Good stress as well.
Get at least 8–9 hrs of sleep at night. Do not do shift work.
Eat a well balanced diet , focusing on protein, vegetables and fruits. Drink plenty of water.
Don't skip any psychiatrist appointments . Take all medications as prescribed.
Keep noise, lights, and busy situations toned down.
Take one day at a time.
Do not fly more than 3 time zones in 1 day.
Take Fish oil supplements.
Get outside every day for sunshine for at least 30 minutes.
DO NOT USE THC OR ANY OTHER STREET DRUGS
Keep a daily schedule of the things you want to accomplish and follow it.
Shower, wash your hair and get dressed including shoes every am.
Have at least 3 people you can call to do activities with .
Know your warning signs of a relapse.
Judge how well you are doing on 6 months ago, not last week.
Those are just off the top of my head. I hope they are helpful guidelines.",schizophrenia
965,"Yes, you will likely recover and return to normal without drugs. You may never be the same again, but at least better.
I remember years ago, the fear I felt when I first started hearing voices. It was too much to bear and I fled to the community clinic where I was directed to a psych ward.
When I was there, I was started on tranquilizers and some side effect med. The desk nurse there assured me that drugs would be the answer to my problems. But they weren't .
I continued hearing voices at full speaking volume for a good two years or so, despite large quantities of psychotropics. And naturally those drugs had side effects beyond the range of the side effect meds. So, the answer created yet other issues while not really correcting the original problem.
By then I had decided that if the drugs were not addressing the actual issue I took them for, then I should stop. So I did. Without the psych meds, the problem slowly subsided until it was just a background effect, similar t...

966,"Natural ways to treat schizophrenia would be to take as best care of yourself as possible. I find that the more you agree with the choices you make (meaning they align with what you believe to be truly right and what is best) the quieter the voices become. When I get carried away with cocktails, recreational party favors, take too many naps, procrastinate on anything, stop working out, as with anyone, my mental state becomes uneasy. I don’t feel very good about myself and the voices turn up, along with the negative symptoms such as lack of focus and motivation, withdrawal, and fatigue. So, be self-aware, and avoid that victim mentality that says I can’t control these voices, and do your best to control the things that you can….. and the voices should lift a bit. At least it works for me.",schizophrenia
967,"I am diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I had no insurance for nine years. I researched and tried hundreds of nutritional supplements, vitamins, herbs, exotic and common. I tried microdosing psyllicibin. I tried Ketogenic diet. I tried everything.
Some things made a tiny difference. So tiny as to be worthless. I still yelled and screamed, hallucinated, hid in closets, etc.
In 2020, while under the care of a psychotherapist, I began taking full spectrum CBD oil.
It had an effect in reducing schizophrenia symptoms. I was taking 600 to 1200 mg/day, the dosage used in research experiments.
I still had symptoms. I increased the dose to 2800 mg/day. My schizophrenia is now under control.
The research dose is limited by funding. CBD is expensive. I make my own, so am not limit ed by cost.
My shrink, after documenting four years of therapy, now considers my cbd treatment to be as effective as, or more effective than, treatment with pharmaceutical antipsychotics.
Without side effects.
The research shows the same.
I am not a doctor, and I am not providing medical advice. I am simply stating what has been successful in my own case.
Thank you for asking this question.",schizophrenia
968,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness. It is challenging, mysterious and terrifying at the same time. However, I have seen many patients (with a very few exceptions) who have recovered completely after being treated with medications.
Unfortunately, there is a massive stigma against mental illness. As a result, patients (especially from rural areas of India) often go to faith healers before seeking medical care.
As of today, there is no evidence of any natural cure for schizophrenia. However, here are a few general pieces of advice that might help in the process of recovery:
Exercise: Regular physical activity will ensure good physical fitness and reduce metabolic complications, which is common in patients with schizophrenia
Adequate sleep: Adequate sleep recharges the mind and body and helps in recovery.
Balanced diet: Protects against metabolic complications and provides essential nutrients.
Good social support: Adequate emotional support from family and friends has been associated with better outcome in schizophrenia
Getting information from reliable sources: Trust only reliable sources for information. Your psychiatrist may help you in this process.
However, it is unlikely that any of these measures will lead to recovery on their own. Therefore, it is always advisable to consult a psychiatrist and remain compliant with the prescribed treatment.
Here are a few sources of information regarding schizophrenia that one may refer to:

Get rid of any polyurethane (especially crumbling)undercarpeting, stick to all natural materials, get rid of the mold. No Bleu cheese, no Stilton, things like that. Read the label. Anything with a hormone disruptor stays on the shelf (sodium laurel sulfate). Ditch the birth control pills. (Use the least physically disruptive b.c.which is condoms). Use Dr. Bronner's or equivalent. No herbicides or pesticides. Don't live on a truck route, try to live a few floors above the street or in the country. Having done that, start with a basic macrobiotic diet (broad range of acceptable foods),) including every day a good prebiotic and some rosemary. Do NOT use meats that are not grass fed in any event or dairy or eggs. When things slowly abate (this takes awhile), also walking every day, start with a small sample of a food not otherwise included. If there is a reaction, then avoid that food. Very important to be clean but not overly clean and do not use fluoridated water. Purchase a water filtration device. In times past “a country vacation” was recommended and in many respects a country vacation with an elimination diet is what I am suggesting. There are also products on the market which cleanse the colon, very important, and are very gentle detox.",schizophrenia
970,"I've struggled with schizophrenia for 25 years. I've tried all sorts of medications and have been hospitalized many times. I've had good times and bloody awful times with my local mental health services. At the end of the day I've come to realise that management of life stressors is the best way forward for me. I take 1 antipsychotic med a day and this helps but it isn't magic. I eat healthy , exercise , look after my dog ( a huge help ), mix with family and friends and have a part time job (paid) and a voluntary job as a MH advocate.

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

972,"I believe that if you can present a person with a model of the brain that shows that the events or behaviors that earn a person the diagnosis of schizophrenia are actually coming from a part of their brain that they are not consciously aware of, perhaps they can learn to understand their hallucinatory thinking in a way that makes them feel better about themselves.
Using this model, people can learn to incorporate their unexpected knowledge of this hidden thinking into an integrated sense of self. If they learn how to understand the experiences that are called “hallucinations” in a different light, they no longer have to be scared of these other kinds of thoughts, nor let those thoughts influence them in a way that leads to depression or antisocial actions. This would be sufficient recovery, in my opinion.
I think people can learn to integrate their different selves with or without medication. Medication is problematic because it can make people think they don’t have to do any integration. But medication is not a permanent answer. People have to learn to integrate their differing selves or they will continue to behave in dysfunctional ways.
If people take medication to relieve some of the symptoms while they work to integrate themselves, then it is worth taking medication. If the medication doesn’t relieve symptoms or has too many negative side effects — the most important one being a serious diminution in the ability to sense the different minds inside the brain — then medication isn’t worth it. It’s better to focus on integrating the selves.
I would seek out someone who can teach you how to understand the different selves that you are, and how to integrate those selves. They should be able to structure a program for you that will help you learn to do this. It will take at least a decade. If you can’t find someone to guide you, then I would meet at least once a week with other people who are working on the same problem. It would be even better to meet with them at least three times a week, or more, as much as you can.
There are many other things that can help you in the process of integration of selves, but it is most important to have help from people who are experienced in the process — and these are more likely to be other people with the diagnosis. Psychiatrists and psychologists without lived experience are not so helpful, I have found. Also, the barrier placed between professional and patient due to the rules of the profession create a serious blockage in the process of integrations of selves. I would avoid professionals and stick with peer support. I would find a guide with experience in the process to serve as a mentor. Then I’d do the work, and expect it to take ten years, at least.",schizophrenia
973,"I started taking kratom in April this year. I was diagnosed in 2008 and have been taking antipsychotic meds ever since. But the delusions remained despite taking my meds 100% of the time. Only until I started taking kratom in low responsible doses (4–6 grams three times a day) did the delusional thinking go away.
There is a study you can read which you can find if you Google kratom and antipsychotic by Yale. I have actually been in touch with one of the authors and he confirmed that the dosage I am taking to be the correct therapeutic dosage.
However he also stated that there needs to be more studies done to pass the anecdotal stage it is in right now.
Hope this helps! I have not felt better in my life as there are other added benefits of taking kratom.
I have also been able to reduce one of my antipsychotic meds with my psychiatrist help. I am still on Risperdal but we’ll see and take it very slowly.
Update 7–23–22 I got Covid this week and it seems to have caused the start of psychosis again. I have returned to taking my Latuda again, sadly, but it is much better than having a buzzing on my brain (tactile hallucination), urgent emails (only one thank God), unsupportive texting with one of my kids (prayed and fixed that quickly) and obsessing over my blog’s analytics (done with that too). Tonight I am writing from my heart, ignoring all rules on my blog http://nohameinschizophrenia.com and thanking God for anti-psychotics!
Perhaps for some with a mild case of Schizophrenia kratom and other natural cures might fix it but for anyone with a serious mental health disorder and psychotic symptoms, I believe my psychiatrist is right and that the benefits of being on anti-psychotics outweigh the side effects. Not that we should just put up with them, but keep trying to find ones with the least serious side effects.
Please if you are experiencing signs of psychosis, see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Early intervention is truly the key to stopping the deterioration of our brains.

I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
975,"I can only offer suggestions based on my experience with overcoming bipolar disorder, not schizophrenia. If we consider that both diagnoses are ‘psychotic disorders’ and both have to do with the mind and how it works, they may be of use.
Things that helped me:
* Become very aware of what triggers delusions and episodes of emotional upheaval and / or psychosis. Write down what you noticed, both while they were going on but also in the weeks before they started. Could be things like lack of sleep, having nightmares, becoming more talkative, showing differences in habits and behaviors. Anything really. ALSO write down what is ‘normal’ for you. All this helps to monitor what is happening in your mental wellbeing and being able to change or work with triggers might help to avoid problems.
* Be very steady in good habits. Get enough sleep, go to bed at the same time every day as much as possible. Eat healthy foods at set times. Have a daily walk outside in the fresh air, preferably in nature. Avoid the use of drugs, cannabis, coffee and alcohol: you want to know just how you are feeling and what your reactions are and monitor if they change or not. Using drugs, alcohol, cafeine etcetera hampers that.
* Learn to meditate - start slowly and in the beginning do just a few minutes per day. Don’t get carried away, don’t do long retreats or hours of meditation or chanting mantra’s at once, no need for that, keep it simple. Meditation trains the mind to be calm and to focus.
* You may also start to practice yoga, again, start slowly, don’t overdo it, take one hour of yoga in a class per week and once you get used to that you can try to do some yoga exercises at home. Yoga and meditation were developed ages ago, to help get control over the mind.
* If possible, build up social skills and self-care skills. Become independent, build a network of people you can rely on, make friends, do volunteers work or other work, keep your house or room clean and tidy, live a simple life and look for fulfillment in daily practical stuff. Build up self-confidence.
* See a therapist or a counselor and let them help you work through and heal from traumatic or other difficult life experiences you had.",schizophrenia

I have witnessed schizophrenia, as my mother has this.
When I was around 12 , I remember that my mother couldn't recognize me and my brother even though we are her own children and treating us like her enemies who came to trouble her!! She had hallucination like someone is continuously scolding her and laughing at her for each and every actions! She was thinking that a group of people observing her with the intension to trouble her. She was quarrelling with my grand ma who was living with us after the death of my father and grandpa from long time. She had high insecurity and possessiveness on me and my brother. Later on the things automatically changed and she started to show love towards her family and could recognize everyone whom she knows. Our relatives villagers, neighbours all helped her a lot to overcome the illness by communicating freely and showing love and respect towards her. Now she is alright with everglowing smile on her face. She was suffering from last 26 years and it took approx 15 years to overcome!

977,"MEDITATION TECHNIQUES FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder which makes a person totally out of his/ her control and it becomes too much difficult for both the Schizophrenics and their attendants or family members to live a peaceful life.
Well, medications have been searched and created to recover from Schizophrenia but it has too much of side effects, which makes life more problematic and unattainable for the Schizophrenics and their family members or attendants.
After considering these situations and conditions, a positive outcome has come of treating Schizophrenia without any medications but with total peace and harmony and that too without any side effects on anyone.
Meditation is that full proof treatment for Schizophrenia which has only positive effects on a person rather than any of the side effects caused by medication. It is a long going process of treatment depending on the severity of the patient so it would be better enough if the treatment for Schizophrenia is started with meditation and Yoga Techniques from the very beginning stages of Schizophrenia.
For making the Schizophrenics to follow the steps of meditation we have to be patient enough as it would take long times for the Schizophrenics to completely follow the steps. In such conditions, we have to keep encouraging the patients about the positive results of doing it and also keep encouraging them for the daily routine activities of life so that it becomes clearly visible to us when the patients starts recovering back from Schizophrenia. We should never leave the patients or the Schizophrenics alone, as that time of loneliness takes them to hallucinations and make them live in an invisible world.
Encouragement and company to Schizophrenics is essential to make them follow the rules and regulations for Meditation and we have to be always calm and cool with them, considering their conditions when they go into hallucinations, delusions, negative energies prompting them not to listen, understand and positive with the life being.
So here are the main types of meditation techniques mentioned below to help anyone suffering with any kind of mental illness.
Primordial Sound Meditation (PSM):
This type of meditation is done or practised with the view to know oneself and then proceed further. In this meditation technique, the main focus is a silent sound called a primordial sound, which is a mantra practice. People can easily say OM and feel the vibration of that sound for the benefit of the whole body, especially mind which requires total peace, harmony, understanding, knowledge and all to live in this world.
Focused Attention Meditation:
The idea of this type of meditation is to focus on a single object throughout the session. This could be a mantra, visualization, candle, image or just about anything. With practice, the ability to stay focused irrespective of distractions will increase. This form of meditation is great for enhancing the depth and firmness of the attention powers by staying in the present moment. This will help turn off the constant stream of thoughts and slip into an altered state of consciousness.
Zen Meditation (Zazen):
Zazen is a Japanese word and it means seated meditation. This is a Buddhist meditation and here the main focus is on becoming aware of the breath and non-reactive observation of the thoughts and experiences as they come to a person in meditation.
Self-Inquiry Meditation:
Self-Inquiry to oneself is a path to higher levels of consciousness. In ancient times, this technique was used to learn about true desires – to understand what the soul wants by means of asking oneself. Here it is required to be mindful and then ask questions to oneself about the desires, hopes, intensions, and other queries about self. When practiced, this technique allows to leave the confines of the body and ego. Time and space are said to merge within the mind and then Samadhi – a pure, enlightened state is attained.
Mirror Gazing Meditation:
This meditation requires one to sit in a relaxed comfortable position and place a mirror within a distance that’s comfortable to the eyes. Now the person can start gazing into his eyes. There is no need to stress the eyes or focus too hard. At the beginning, one can gaze for five minutes and gradually increase the time up to 20 minutes.
Kundalini Meditation:
Practicing this spiritual technique is the way to rouse the sleeping planetary power that is located at the base of the spine. With this meditation, this energy is drawn up through the body, awakening the seven chakra points or energy cyclones in the body. It is believed that when the energy reaches the crown chakra it causes an experience called Kundalini awakening, which leads to enlightenment. Kundalini meditations can consist of breathing techniques, mantras, mudras (hand gestures) and chants.
Tonglen Meditation:
This meditation technique is from the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. In plain distinctions with the pleasure-seeking attitudes, this meditation technique encourages to connect with suffering in order to overcome it. Through this meditations, one can learn to accept suffering with openness, let go of negativity and develop feelings of consideration and responsiveness through breath exercises, conceptions and focusing intent.
Loving Kindness Meditation:
It is also known by the name of Metta Meditation which means complete kindness and friendliness. This is a heart-centred meditation which can be simply defined as love with wisdom or unconditional love for oneself and others. This meditation teaches to love and respect others as oneself, means considering others as own and love and respect them as one will do with himself. In time, we include others who have special significance to us, then to a neutral being, a difficult person, and finally to all living things in the universe.
Transcendental Meditation (TM):
This meditation got started by Maharishi Mahesh Yoga in 1955. TM allows the mind to easily and naturally surpass conscious thinking to experience a deep state of peacefully alert awareness. The Transcendental Meditation technique is the most widely studied forms of meditation.
Qigong (Chi kung):
Qigong also pronounced as chi kung or chi gung is a Chinese term which means life energy cultivation. It is a part of martial art training which requires conscious body movement, inner focus and controlled breathing. One of the main aims of Qigong meditation would be to empty the mind. However, we should not block out any thoughts that emerge when we are meditating as they can be used for Self-examination, knowledge and clarification.",schizophrenia
978,"Oh yes, please be assured that is the case. Just the other day I was reading research (on recovery from psychosis) which said that 67% people recover completely from it. Of course that research was from the US, and I am not sure this would be any but their statistics. But the reality is that many recover in every part of the world.
My own phd is focused on recovery from psychosis (which happens in both schizophrenia and bipolar). I personally know at least a few who have recovered from schizophrenia right here in India itself.
And in case you did not know, John Nash recovered and did not take any medication for at least 25 years of his life. So be assured it is nothing extraordinary, but a matter of dedication and discipline…a majority can recover. But it does not happen by putting psychiatry as the leader of one’s life. Get that clear.",schizophrenia
979,"There’s no magic pill. Antipsychotics can get rid of positive symptoms, which are hallucinations and delusions for a quoted which must be well known, 75 percent of patients. So this is far from perfect. However it is possible that medication helps and i have relatives who in effect wouldn’t have survived without it. I on the other hand were tried on a few before any real help. Quetiapine which is used for mania and depressive disorders as well as psychotic disorders did help, and i see how it helped the depression too, however i still welcomed a med swicth because i suffered again with too much of the positive symptoms once more.
I had a med switch onto respiridone, which, somehow, has gone well, and comparitively, on a lower dose. It tends to have slightly more antipsychotic properties. It is adjusting to being less numb in some ways, and more proactively treating depressive and negative symptoms, alongside this swicth. It seems to be working but time will still tell.
I too will like to take CBD higher strength because i dose i take of that is still pretty low, CBD generally is very good however seems to be a big marketing thing with making it so expensive. But it’ll be worth me increasing my intake of that.
So it can be very hit and miss but the newer anti psychotics altohugh not massively differen’t in mechanism will have fewer side effects. Like i say luckily i seem to have succeeded in a switch which will see me with less side effects long term. They all can have side effects. That’s why doctors are always going for the lowest dose possible. But it doesn’t always work and they are often too quick though still, in my opinion to ramp it right up but i suppose it is possible that therapies can be of assistance its just difficult when sufferers are in psychosis, usually.
So yes, and no, depends, and its entirely possible because there is no magic pill.",schizophrenia
980,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
981,"In the 1970s there was something called vitamin therapy. Therapists who used this method claimed that it helps about 5O% of the time. This is opposed to mainstream medications that can claim absolutely NO cures. Antipsychotics only mask symptoms, never curing them, so people have to stay on medication for life; otherwise their symptoms return with a vengeance.
But with vitamin therapy, people would actually improve to the point where they were no longer hearing voices or believing in illogical thoughts. They could discontinue medications and, gradually, the vitamins, and they could resume their daily lives without needing them any more.
I had a friend (diagnosed schizophrenic) who had been on and off antipsychotics for over a year. When on them, he wasn’t himself. He slept a lot and couldn’t think, having to be regularly reminded to do basic care for himself. His thoughts came slowly and dully. This was intolerable so he’d stop taking the meds. When he wasn’t taking them, he got suicidal, thinking that he was the devil and that strangers were talking about him and planning to torture and kill him. When on the meds, he still believed this, but was too sluggish to do anything about it; and no one could convince him that it wasn’t true. I desperately searched for a psychiatrist who would not prescribe those antipsychotics in the hope that he would get off that horrid merry-go-round. This new doctor prescribed massive doses of B vitamins, also vitamins C, E, calcium, and magnesium. Within a month he could wean himself off the antipsychotics. He came back to being himself, and left off believing he was the devil. No more paranoia or suicidal episodes.
Unfortunately, the brain damage from having taken the too many antipsychotics for so long was too severe for him to hold down a steady job. But nevertheless, he was alert and able to take care of himself on disability payments, and could enjoy his hobbies; something he could not do since before he was first hospitalized.
The vitamin therapy became less available over the years, because it was expensive, and Medicaid and most insurance companies would not pay for it.",schizophrenia
982,"Well, doctors don’t know how to “naturally” treat it.
I would say to work on your diet and start exercising. You have to eat right to feel right. While it may not cure your schizophrenia, you will feel better and won’t suffer as much. A major part of this brain disease is how a person’s habits are that can make it better or worse for them mentally. For example, someone who is on the street and doesn’t sleep or eat will see giant monsters that are as bad as shadow people or some voices. Make sure to clear any natural remedy with your doctor. Fish oil is something many recommend, but people like me can’t take it due to another medication.",schizophrenia
983,"You can recover from anything, and let me tell you something if your diagnosed with something like asthma can you breathe normally? The answer to that is yes you can, unless symptoms start to appear or you exert yourself to the point that you need an inhaler or some medication. Listen when someone is diagnosed with something like schizophrenia it does not mean he/she is crazy it means she fits a illness with these rare symptoms, people with schizophrenia are actually quite normal until they get odd symptoms. These symptoms begin in the head specially in the brain sometimes to a neuron level sometimes they are affected in a way that makes the person hear things which is the most common symptom, auditory hallucination. The other more scarier ones like paranoia, or visual hallucinations, or other strange symptoms are actually rare if they take medication todays medications are actually pretty powerful and will help diminish those unwanted symptoms and also auditory symptoms. People with schizophrenia recover to a state we would call normal some better than others. John Nash a famous mathematician with schizophrenia actually recovered for years even without medication, to say 30+ years he didn’t suffer a single symptom of schizophrenia which we can say for the most part that he fully recovered but only he knows if he did or did not. Don’t worry if someone you know has schizophrenia always make sure they are aware that you are a friend and a loved one, comfort them don’t push them away, we both know they are still human not some animal or alien, they deserve respect and love, treat them nicely, they are still the same person, they are still humans.",schizophrenia

* Work. We can be productive. What do we excel at? Who knows? We can still push a lawn mower.
* Marry. Yes the world has not ended, you can still have sexual relationships.

985,I can't answer this question. Psychiatric doctors have never told it is curable . Being myself enveloped in this due to my son illness of paranoid schizophrenia for last 26 years .I have no occasion to meet any who could tell about cure. On other hand this illness - if it a illness! is mired with curse or other such things can't be explained .Many people run after faith healing etc. It is seen as a stigma in the society and people just keep away instead of giving any help .I was told by a MD doctor that it is a cancer of the mind. I know only one hope that is Prayer to God which gives relief on day to day basis but sometimes or frequently there are episodes too to face . I do not care what readers think about me after all how can i escape with 26 years of sufferings.,schizophrenia

I was in psichotic states, and hearing voices for years
I been under psichiatric medication, with no succes, or even goin down.
Doctors said I was a lost case, be prepared for taking pills the rest of your life.
Personally , I think that medicationsa can be helpfull in a short place. But at long term are conterproductive. During the first months was ok to take pills, I just feel relaxed…like a zoombie
But , I feel my mind like you are into the mud, you can´t move aheat. And realize that pils do nothing for me, For only reason i find usefull is for sleeping. sleeping is a key factor for recovery.
Keep you busy, get a job, a heavy load, construction gardening
Constant demand is important. Stay at home bored only makes thgik wors and makes you lazy
And the most important is DIET
You have to follow a keto diet.
It was a miracle, After some weeks all the woices were gone and not more psicothic episodes
Beliveme.
What I cant understant, is that people is so lazy and dont have enough willpower, to follow a keto diet, even knowing that it can change their lifes.
Many people prefers laying at home, selfcoplaining, condescendent with himsel and taking pills that makes you a zombie, and refuses to do the diet…….
Ijust can say: take the keto diet, or be prepared for taking pills the rest of your life
Take it or leaf it…………
For those who belive that is not serious, please take a look :

987,"I have been on a recovery journey since 2018. I was at the point of constantly wanting to kill myself, experiencing breakthrough psychosis and delusions, looping, intrusive thoughts, and heavily impacted cognitive function. I was taking 30mg of olanzapine antipsychotics and it didn’t help. nothing was helping. Sleeping 12+ hours, weight gain, sedation, drinking 10 scotches a day and smoking just to cope with it all. Taking 4–5 valiums some days. Things were looking bleak. I tried stopping medication many times but the psychosis and delusions got worse/returned with a vengeance.
Fast forward to now almost 5 years since my onset. Most of the problems have dissipated. I only take 5mg antipsychotics, don’t take Valium, lost weight, sleep normal hours now, barely drink anymore, aren’t very depressed at all, psychosis isn’t a problem on meds, sometimes it occurs but it’s very mild. And most important to me my cognitive functioning has returned to almost premorbid levels. I can read, study, write, and have meaningful conversations with others once again.
I’ve still got some ways to go, I want to get back into study and maybe do another degree, or at least emulate parts of one by my own means through self study, auto-didacticism. Maybe volunteer, or go back to work. Maybe write a short book. Who knows. Even though I can’t do some of the things I used to be able to do before my illness started, at the same level, I’d say I’m not far off. Keeping in mind I’m still relatively new to my recovery and I’ve made so much progress, I’m proud of myself, the fact that I’m still here living and breathing. As one of my psychiatrists said to me “things can only get better” - like the song. I have a feeling I’ll keep improving and life will become even sweeter.

988,"If you mean, get better if they are in an episode, yes, as far as I know, most people with schizophrenia get better once they are (back) on their medication. Many of them get better to the point of being productive members of our society, free of delusions and hallucinations.
If you mean, however, get better to the point of being cured…that is a different question altogether. There are people here on Quora who claim they are healed from schizophrenia but they are the exception. Most mental health professionals more or less agree that schizophrenia can only be kept under control with medicaments but can’t be healed so a person wouldn’t need medication anymore.
Original question: Do people with schizophrenia ever recover?",schizophrenia
989,"You might be interested in reading the book ""Treating the Untreatable: Healing in the Realms of Madness” by Ira Steinman, a psychotherapist that has worked for over 40 years with schizophrenics. It offers a lot of hope. It is certainly possible for a schizophrenic to recover (even without meds) sufficiently that they can study, get a full-time job, have a family, and live a long, independent life—though I am not sure if they can ever recover completely to 100%.
Many psychiatrists and laypeople these days will suggest that someone with schizophrenia needs to take powerful antipsychotic medications for the rest of their lives. The funny thing though is that countries that are too poor to afford these medications have higher long-term recovery rates from schizophrenia than those countries that generally rely on them. Food for thought…",schizophrenia
990,"As a clinical pharmacist intern working in the Psychological/Behavioral Health unit of a hospital, my experience with schizophrenia involves a 29-year-old patient who has exhibited severe symptoms. The individual was admitted due to agitation, euphoria, hallucinations, and insomnia. Shockingly, he had a history of violent incidents, including stabbing someone multiple times and causing a fatal car accident. He attributed these actions to his state of madness and delusion, and he displayed aggression towards his family, nearly harming his father.
Throughout the interviews, the patient's responses were inconsistent. He initially claimed to be getting married next month but later stated he was searching for a wife. When questioned about traumatic events triggering his schizophrenia, he couldn't recall. The patient's agitation occasionally escalated to physical aggression, requiring me, as a pharmacist, to sit in a locked room with communication occurring through glass openings.
Despite his unpredictable behaviour, the patient disclosed that consuming KFC or Burger King would calm him during angry episodes. To manage his manic attacks, we would promise to get him a burger, bringing a soothing effect.
In our attempt to address his condition, we explored various medications and supplements until the doctor recommended Fulvic Ionic Minerals. Intrigued by success stories, we decided to integrate them into his routine. While progress was gradual, the impact on his health, particularly regarding brain function, became evident.
Fulvic Ionic Minerals played a crucial role in supporting his brain health and overall well-being, enhancing cognitive function, nutrient absorption, and energy levels. The integration of these minerals into his daily routine continues, and regular check-ups provide relief as positive changes and improvements in his overall health unfold.",schizophrenia

The range of thinking subjects and ideas that a person can think about is very huge and the thinking mind is constantly weighing things out and thinking, thinking, thinking. Sometimes it will think things that seem weird, or odd, or crazzzzy. But as long as you are retaining your basic Self, it’s most likely you are not mentally ill. This kind of thinking about stuff is very normal, and even if you go to the far ends of thinking, that’s okay because it allows your mind to be bigger and more interesting.

995,"Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental health condition which is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, language and behaviour. It includes hallucinations which can be auditory, visual or tactile in nature. A person affected by schizophrenia often harbours beliefs which are false in nature and exist in the form of delusions.
There may be disorganised speech, which maybe incoherent and/or irrelevant. A person experiences issues with emotions, in the form of a general apathy or a mismatch between real feelings and expression. There may be an inability to understand information and further problems with attention and focus.
A person experiencing negative symptoms may require additional help with managing everyday routine. One area which requires attention is self hygiene.Depending on the intensity of the illness, one is able to manage everyday functioning.
It is important to understand that it is a mental disorder which impairs overall functioning and therefore it is important to be well aware of how to deal with the illness as caregivers. For an individual experiencing schizophrenia, an effective treatment plan can be laid out to ensure that the symptoms are managed. As family members, support can be a pivotal element. Making sure that the medical treatment is followed up regularly can be advantageous.",schizophrenia
996,"Er. Yes. I'm a schizophrenic. I've been with my totally brilliant and totally not crazy other half for ten years and married for six and going strong. My disease was early onset and inititially very severe and it was expected that I wouldn't really have much of a life and spend much of it in hospital. I had ECT, I had all the drugs, I was sectioned 10 times It was bullshit.
Despite the supposed severity of my illness, I managed to train and get a full time job. I take minimal meds and rely mainly on a rigorously, almost obsessively set routine. If I know something is a big trigger for elements of my illness, I do not stay around them (I do not own or work anywhere near radios or televisions or speakers for example). I 'logic out' my hallucinations and psychosis. I do, for the most part, understand that they are not real and can figure that they are not real by the fact the no one else reacts to them. It's sort of like being in a crowd at a gig and having to concentrate on the one conversation you are having and tuning out everything else around you.
I have always been open with my husband and he is, to all extents and purposes, still my carer. He would not let me go to my job if I was starting to slip out of remission, he will have no qualms in ringing a hospital or the police if he feels I need it. He has no worries about our electronically restricted lives or the security cameras I wanted outside. He is an amazing man. He was never ever daunted by it and he has support of his own in groups that he attends.
BUT I am fortunate in many regards. I am fortunate that I found ways to deal with this illness on a daily basis, I am fortunate that I am so in-tune with it that I understand the signs of it very well. I am fortunate that my family and the man I married are as supportive as they are. Very few people are that fortunate.
We will never have children though. I could never risk giving this illness to someone else. I may be able, now, to live a high functioning life, but I know I am the exception and I also know how long, frightening and hard the journey is and how difficult the most everyday situations can be. I would not forgive myself for choosing to have a child that I KNOW can take this on, like I took it on from my (also wonderful, but still) family.",schizophrenia
997,"Schizophrenia is not something you “get over” or cure. Sorry. It is a major mental illness which has troubling symptoms. Sometimes these symptoms are scary and no one who has them wants them. These symptoms can be reduced, eliminated or managed. Probably all 3, depending on your case and the symptoms.
The best and only way to reduce or eliminate the symptoms is with medication. Psychiatrists are the specialist doctors who prescribe these medications. Not every person with schizophrenia takes exactly the same medicine. The doctor prescribes the medicine based on multiple factors which YOU as the patient report to the doctor. Once you and your doctor find the best medication for your current needs, you can be referred to another mental health professional who can teach you ways to manage any symptoms which may remain.
Schizophrenia is a life long illness and the person’s symptoms can change over time as they age and live. When you find medicine that help you and work well you still have to see the doctor every so often because these medicines sometimes stop working so well and they need to be adjusted.
I hope you have access to a mental health care system in your community where you can find the medical help you require. This depends a lot on your country. For example in the US where I live we do not have national healthcare so each state has a mental healthcare system and they are all a bit different. If you are in the US I suggest you contact NAMI (Natil Assoc Mental Illness) —-this is a non profit organization which can give you a referral to a mental health clinic in your community. Some places have more than one. Most places only have one.
You may have found that already since you seem to know the name of your diagnosis (schizophrenia).",schizophrenia

Is schizophrenia a life sentence or was Krapelin wrong?

1003,"I have been fascinated with schizophrenia my entire existence but have never tried to articulate why.
Every person I've ever met with Schizophrenia I felt an instant bond with and loved. I never once saw them as crazy, but just misunderstood, even by those who claimed to love them or want to help them.
And there in lies one of my keys to my fascination with schizophrenia. I have felt misunderstood my entire life. I have never had the blessing or priviledge of having a conventional life even though that was all I ever longed for. I couldn't even create a conventional life for myself because to do so depends on people around you and if others are not going to go along with treating you like a conventional person then it's going to fail because a conventional life involves others who are willing to engage with you as if you are a conventional person.
Therefore against my will and who I am inside I have lived and acted and talked like an unconventional person.
Don't get me wrong! I love my unconventional self! But others tend not to. I guess it was this that made me be able to understand and relate to people with schizophrenia. I was always fascinated with what they had to to say.
When they spoke about life unconventionally and came up unconventional conclusions, I got it! I understood them and why they thought the way they did. Conventional people probably underestimate just how much their environment life, order and social connections keep them 'sane'.
I also noticed that conventional people also come to outrageous conclusions or feel things that are inappropriate to the situation, or react in inappropriate ways, BUT they never admit it to themselves- their defenses are one major thing that separates the person with schizophrenia and the so called normal person.
A normal person could break too if they started to systematically but incrementally have their life unraveled.
I wonder even if people with schizophrenia are victims of very subtle gaslighting or bullying that causes them to question themselves. I think in some cases this is what happens to some people with schizophrenia.
Notice how loose my logic is in all I've said above. That is one symptom of schizophrenia- loose associations- another reason why I can understand and relate to them so well.
I have another reason for my fascination with schizophrenia. Yes, I do believe it is a brain disease and fragments the personality. But I have studied the various so called delusions and they seem to be the same world wide. I often wonder if some of these delusions could be true.
I don't think anyone even in the police station has taken anyone seriously who says for example that they think someone is spying on them or the tv is talking direct to them or the voices they hear. Yet, let's admit the technology exists so that these things could be possible.
So, the next coommon objection is 'they aren't famous. Why would anyone follow them or plant voices around them etc'. I don't know about you but I've met many intelligent but malicious and immature jerks who would in fact harass on such a level if they had the means.
It just seems some of their complaints should be looked into not just dismissed. Their delusions have always fascinated me.
So, why is schizophrenia so fascinating? I'm still not sure I can answer that question. I feel a kindred spirit with them. Why? They survive in a world where everything they are is dismissed! And yet they survive! They are a true example of the courage of the human spirit.",schizophrenia
1004,"I have a theory.
It's only spoken out of experience with this mind state, and clearly not backed by any research.
People that we surround ourselves with. The more people we try and interact with, the worse our paranoia is. The more we attempt relationships, the more delusional we get.
Some people in this world aren't harmful to our mind, but most are. I'm not speaking on the ""bad"" and ""good"" in people, but their actions and how it affects our mind.
If someone asks me too many questions, I will get paranoid. If someone speaks about me when I'm not around, whether it be good or bad things, I will likely have auditory hallucinations. If I have social media, or any sort..I will likely have a reserved hatred toward everyone. If someone looks my way at the grocery store, I will look over my shoulder until I get home. If someone even smiles at me or acts as if they are interested in me, I will think they are plotting against me.
And so on.
It's the people around us that make us progressively worse over time. Any person, all people. I am more concerned with the guy that held the door open for me at the gas station than the boy that committed the mass shooting in Florida. Yep, I said it. It doesn't make sense to you, I know, but it does to me.
As we get older, we experience more people and more surroundings…catch my drift?
Sure, blame the medication or lack of. I'll blame the people.
I'll say one thing for sure; the only reason I'm able to have a stable job working long hours is because I don't have to be social during those hours. I don't have anxiety when I get home because I live and hang out with my dog when I get off work and no one else. I don't go shopping, I don't have social media, I don't have friends, I rarely attend any family function and I don't go out to bars and shit. I used to….now I'm asocial, I feel better now than I did before.",schizophrenia
1005,"It is often thought that people with bipolar disorder only have psychosis stemming from a manic episode. This is the usual case, but they can also have psychosis stemming from a depressive episode.
However, there is another difference in psychosis. It can be either mood-congruent or mood-incongruent. This means that the psychosis may, or may not, corresponds to the mood.
For example if a person is manic, you would expect their psychosis to display manic tendencies, as in feeling that they have been sent from heaven to put the world right. If they are mood-incongruent, however, they could easily feel so desperate that they think they have murdered a whole nation of people.
If a person is in depression when they become psychotic, you would expect them to feel guilty, for example, for poisoning their family. You would not expect them to be laughing when their dog has died.
This difference is very important when it comes to psychiatric treatment.",schizophrenia
1006,"I’ll always remember the time when I was severely depressed and I woke up in the middle of the night feeling incredibly anxious and fearful. I was convinced that I had seen the future and that my life was only going to get worse. My mind was racing and I felt 100% confident I was only going to continue suffering.
In that moment I was delusional. I had an overwhelming urge to kill myself. It was the only logical thing to do, because I had seen a glimpse of my future and I knew for certain that I would never be happy. I felt like I was going mad. My heart was racing and I was fumbling around trying to find my cellphone. I wanted to check myself in a mental institute, because the urge to kill myself was so powerful.
Thankfully, I never did find my phone. I felt so sick that I had to crawl to the bathroom wanting to vomit. Twenty minutes passed and my anxiety slowly decreased and I was coming back to my senses. I dismissed my prophecy as a hallucination and I went back to sleep.
At least I hope it was only a hallucination..",schizophrenia
1007,"First of all; if you are suffering from depression YOU MUST SEEK HELP!!!
I think that I understand what you mean by insane. I’ve lived with depression for as long as I can remember. The first time I sought help was when I turned 30. Late one night, after I came home from work and felt that my depression would eventually kill me one way or another, I called the suicide hotline and talked to a woman who encouraged me to seek help.
Anyways, to answer your question; yes I do believe that the constant fight to keep your ‘head above water’ can finally be too much for a person. The constant questioning yourself, the constant feeling of being inferior to others, the worthlessness, the hopelessness and despair. A friend, who knows about my depression, recently told me about a woman he worked with that was depressed; she worked so hard trying to keep up a facade at work and that it was so tiring that she didn't have the energy to keep her own house clean. I have never been able to keep my apartment clean and this is why. If a person doesn't sleep it can drive them insane and eventually kill them. The constant mental fatigue of fighting depression is quite similar.",schizophrenia
1008,"The only way that depression could lead to schizophrenia is if you have the predisposition for schizophrenia already…but the depressive disorder itself, does not “cause” schizophrenia. It is a different illness, with different origins, genetics, and biology.
However, if left untreated, Major Depressive Disorder usually (not always) gets worse.
By that, I mean that depressive episodes tend to get more intense and last longer if not addressed. In severe depression, individuals can experience psychosis…but unlike schizophrenia, this usually clears when the depressive episode lifts.
I hope this answers your question.",schizophrenia
1009,"It is possible, get help ASAP. Having to fight a battle with yourself in your head is one hell of a bad experience. It can literally drive you insane from within out.

1010,"Not at all. They are two different diseases. It's confusing because many times a person can suffer with both.
Schizophrenia is very much biologically based and has a strong genetic component. It usually appears in the late teens or 20's. The first symptoms to appear are not very clear, so they can sometimes be interpreted as depression at first.
There are also forms of depression that include symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations. Without a proper diagnosis, some people may be treated for the wrong illness until they are evaluated more effectively.
But in the end, depression does not ever cause, or ""lead to,"" schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1011,"Thanks for asking, Yacenia.
From personal experience, depression does not lead to schizophrenia, especially if the only diagnosis is clinical (or unipolar) depression.
If, however, one suffers from bipolar disorder, at the manic end of the spectrum when the sufferer stays awake for very long periods (my personal best has been over 86 hours with no naps) hallucinations such as those found in schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder can manifest, leading to a diagnosis of schizophrenia.
I hope this clarifies things for you.",schizophrenia
1012,"According to me yes, a person diagnosed with severe depression can lead to schizophrenia if not treated properly. Depression can be triggered by other mental illnesses, but it can also lead to certain mental illnesses. These include anxiety disorders , schizophrenia, eating disorders and substance abuse.
In schizophrenia depression often occurs in older people with the condition and is sometimes experienced by people after their psychotic episode has ended. This is called a post-psychotic depression by psychiatrists
Depression was observed as a feature of schizophrenia by Emil Kraepelin when he first described the condition of schizophrenia in the 19th century and has been confirmed by observation and research since",schizophrenia
1013,"Yes and No. Yes, some people are first diagnosed with depression, then later with schizophrenia, so one could say that depression sometimes leads to schizophrenia. But the depression DID NOT cause the schizophrenia. The person could have had depression independent of schizophrenia. Many people who have schizophrenia also have depressed mood. But having depressed mood DOES NOT mean that you will soon (or later) develop the symptoms of schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1014,"Here’s the thing. ‘Insanity’ is NOT a diagnosable mental illness. In fact, it is not even a technical term. It is a colloquial term that can mean different things to different people. So whether depression can lead to insanity depends on your own definition of the word. For instance, depression can often cause problems like derealization/depersonalization or obsessive thoughts. These could be perceived to be insanity. But as scary as these things may feel, they are not harmful and are merely depression symptoms - they almost always go away when depression improves.
On the other hand, ‘insanity’ is sometimes used to refer to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychoses. If you are wondering whether ordinary, garden variety, non-bipolar depression can lead to these sorts of problems, the answer is no.",schizophrenia
1015,"I'm not a psychologist but from what I’ve read it's more likely to be the other way around: those with schizophrenia are likely to develop depression.
I’ve also read that those with bipolar disorder can sometimes experience psychosis during manic episodes, but psychosis alone is not the same thing as schizophrenia (or to be more accurate, the schizophrenias, as there are different types.)
If you or someone you know is experiencing severe depression or psychosis or both, please see a psychologist for a valid, professional diagnosis and a treatment plan; there are therapies that have a good success rate treating mood disorders and managing schizophrenia. There is no need to suffer in silence when help is available.",schizophrenia
1016,"Genetic predisposition, as well as the presence of provocative factors play an important role in the process of occurrence of a mental disorder. In this regard, depression and schizophrenia are no exception.
Modern medicine does not give a definite answer to the question about the causes of these diseases. The main version is a violation of the functionality of special neurotransmitters (depression) and the limbic system of the brain (schizophrenia).
Clinical depression can occur in two forms: unipolar and bipolar. The first form is characterized by deep bouts of despair, depression and lack of interest in life. The second form can be represented as a pendulum: the patient's mood changes dramatically from depressive inaction to manic arousal.
It is bipolar depression accompanied by auditory and visual hallucinations, all sorts of mania. This fact gives grounds to assert that depression and schizophrenia have similar psychotic symptoms and causes of development.
The main sign of schizophrenia is a mismatch of sensory perception of the world and the thought process. In the actions of patients there is a lack of logic and common sense. Patients with schizophrenia often become obsessed with absurd ideas that seem to them rational and only true. Another characteristic symptom of schizophrenia is hallucinations.",schizophrenia
1017,"Depression does not “lead to” Schizophrenia in the sense that it doesn’t cause it.
However depression can be one of the many symptoms experienced by people who have Schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is a chronic, progressive, organic neuro-chemical brain disease that is believed to have a strong causal basis in genetics.
Depression is an important symptom that can be connected to a number of illnesses. It can have mental or physical illnesses as it’s cause.
Anyone experiencing unexplained, intense or protracted symptoms of depression should see their doctor for advice.",schizophrenia
1018,"What is often diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder refers to a pattern of developing schizophrenia-like symptoms during intense bouts of depression or anxiety. In other words, psychotic symptoms arise in connection with identifiable emotional states. Some people with this condition may indeed feel like they are going insane during a depressive episode.
Indeed, what is often referred to as insanity refers to a human being’s immense difficulty coping with a set of traumatic stressors. Accordingly, deep, unresolved depression may give rise to other emotional illnesses. This is why seeking treatment is crucial. These problems do not “clear up” or “go away” by themselves.",schizophrenia

I also believed that others, even strangers, could somehow tell how worthless I was just by looking at me.
I don't believe this form of psychosis is as severe as that which is experienced by schizophrenics and some people with bipolar disorder, but it is certainly a delusional state of mind.",schizophrenia
1022,"As someone who (unfortunately) has experience in this, I find it VERY important to know the difference between the two. I watched my best friend slowly become “taken” by schizophrenia- my good friend and I didn’t know what was happening until it was too late. I only was able to identify the signs of onset schizophrenia, and I REALLY wish the early symptoms were more widely known- it’s not helpful if it’s too late.
One of the most easily spotted signs is disorganized thinking. You can spot this through “word salad” and in intangible conversations. My friend had always been an oddball and said random phrases, but I could always trace it back to an episode of tv we watched or some odd connection- and it usually was actually funny, though very loosely connected. Obscure, yes, but not impossible to figure out where his thoughts came from.
Then that slowly started changing. His random expressions became meaningless. Example: “Reptar and Santa really aren’t going to like that- you’ll be on the naughty list for sure” or “Fishing the popsicle sticks, right?!?!” As though I had ANY idea what he was relating to.
Another verbal indication is complete lack of ability to focus on the topic of the conversation at hand, or even simply responding to your question with an answer to something entirely different. “How long does it take to get there again?” “Well, if Bleep-Blop doesn’t keep holdin’ up the works, I’d say that tomorrow will be a great day to get in some afternoon siestas. Like in Spain, sombrero country- ole! Right, ole!” And Id be like “okay so Google says it’ll take like 20 mins?” And his response “where’s my sombrero, how does enchiladas sound like to you? Woof woof!” And Id respond, confused- “woof?” “And he’d be like “DUH, the Taco Bell dog!! Where’s your brain, Bismarck, South Mississippi?! Come on!” (Obviously a made up place, like usual). It doesn’t have to be this severe- it ohhhh so slowlyyyy became this jumbled that when you finally realize it hasn’t made sense in MONTHS, that this is seriously not right. It’s not a joke you don’t get- it literally has no meaning.
To be honest, the depression is generally a part of schizophrenia, so there is some overlap. But, like ppl with depression, schizophrenics can hide their sadness as well, and you may not even realize that there’s any depression. In fact, they themselves may not realize- their brain is distracting themselves from reality.
I know that schizophrenia is generally onset by a trigger if you’re predisposed to getting it- some trauma or emotional event, some loss, something that really would have enough impact that the brain to feel “attacked” or “threatened” by the outside world. My guess is that the brain starts using schizoid symptoms almost as a defense mechanism against coping with whatever it may be. (Hence why some people may develop some symptoms at more stressful times in their lives, yet it never escalates to full blown schizophrenia). So it IS possible to pull them out- but it is NOT easy to.
This is the one area that it does seem to be similar- BECAUSE schizophrenia is brought in general by traumatic events, depression is one of the first things, but that alone can still just be depression. Not showering, lack of caring anymore, no drive for the future anymore- almost as though it doesn’t exist though. Like time isn’t a thing anymore or something- no mention of the future EVER. Only the past. Not even the present. I suppose THAT is a big sign.
People who are depressed will generally think “there’s no hope for the future”, and want to cry in bed. It seems like schizophrenics at some point decide unconsciously that it may be easier to live WITHOUT “having a future” almost- simply never thinking about it again it seems.
My friend also just did… REALLY weird things. I mean, he was always odd, so at first it didn’t seem that different, plus it wasn’t all the time. That’s the case for everything- it wasn’t ALL the time, so you could still have a real conversation with him at times, then back to the weird state of mind where he’s in his own world. So if someone seems to only “be with it” part of the time- it may not be too late. Don’t mention schizophrenia to them- they will deny it. But if you catch on to the fact that there’s definitely a time when he’s mentally not okay, where you can’t get through to him for “real”- that’s a problem. If you still can talk to him normally sometimes, PLEASE seek help immediately. I don’t know what the best way to get them on treatment would be, but the earlier you catch it, the better.
Another good indicator is when the person starts to feel like people have been “taking” things from them- whether it be an idea, credit for something, or an actual physical item. If they don’t accuse you of perhaps breaking in to hide it just to “mess with them”, then they’ll have a pretty well thought out theory of how the burglary took place, down to the very last detail. If the person you know is at the point where they are waiting up to “catch” this imaginary person, you may be too late.
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN TWO COMPLETELY RANDOM THINGS. My friend would be watching tv and would bet that for SURE someone at work saw the episode before him the night before, and that’s where they got the idea to start getting to work 15 minutes earlier than they used to. (That isn’t supposed to make sense, it is an example of what I’d try to follow before everything just turned to chaos).
Yes, the paranoia is there- but that comes later. The 5” binder of “evidence” that ppl who really work for the government, that the restaurant he worked at was just a cover- have been taking his ideas and claiming them as their own. By then it’s too late. You may get a call from his brother asking if you’ve seen him in the past week and find out he’s in Maryland. Or Illinois.
But the one thing I will say is- my friend never thought he had a problem, and still doesn’t. He thinks the doctors are wrong and are giving him placebo medication to make him forget that he has “the answers”.
So if the person literally just seems like he’s off on a different plane of reality- even just sometimes, that is when you need to act. When you can’t get through to them sometimes and it seems like they aren’t comprehending anything you say at times and don’t give a relevant answer. Don’t sigh out of relief if he’s acting “more normal” today- keep an eye out because at first, they alternate in and out of reality. The they end up developing what seems to be their own reality by the time the disease has fully onset. So ACT QUICKLY!!
A person who may develop some symptoms of schizophrenia in times of stress (for instance, when stressed, I’ll occasionally become paranoid- “it HAD to be this person knocking at the door, they had to have timed that out exactly!” And then afterwards, realize how ridiculous that would be and I was just jumping the gun). So the key is- someone who is really at the risk of developing schizophrenia is unaware of, or doesn’t WANT to be aware of his or her symptoms. Depressed people know they’re depressed, that they may not be mentally okay right now, and will want to seek help/want to feel better. Someone with schizophrenia won’t or doesn’t even know that they need help.",schizophrenia
1023,"Psychosis for me started when I dated a co-worker (very bad idea, never do that) who was psychopathic. I was completely unaware at first but stuff started adding up (she had a very strange obsession with serial killers, would hook up with somebody new every other week behind her boyfriends back, would talk maliciously about people behind their backs, all of her exes were in her words “psychopaths,” every time I did something she didn’t “approve of” I was called a psychopath which was nearly everything as simple as breathing loudly lmfao, and she had absolutely zero empathy when something unfortunate happened to somebody, she came from an extremely broken home, and love bombed the living hell out of me to the point where I fell in love very quickly) Before I met her I was very kind, compassionate, empathetic, and maybe a bit too trusting for my own good. First 2 weeks of the relationship were great, excellent communication, amazing sex, she talked about what a great future we would have together, how this was love at first sight and how similar we were. Then she just flipped a switch out of nowhere. Started becoming distant, started slowly being abusive and cruel, so I told her she was being a bitch and to not talk to me like that if she wants a relationship with me. Then she started the crazy making. Got back together with her boyfriend and wanted him to start working with us, very relentlessly started gossiping about me to everybody, all while playing the victim and wearing the mask of a hopeless little girl. My step dad was her boss and she even convinced him I was this nasty, volatile, psychopath. It REALLY stressed me out psychologically and emotionally. I feel into a really dark depression where I felt extremely sad and helpless because nobody trusted me anymore. I’d go over to my parents house every few weeks to talk about it and try to tell them I was the perfect target for a psychopath and I was being abused and they didn’t believe me. They believed I was crazy. Well this next part was about a 3 month period but my depression kept getting worse and I started thinking maybe I am crazy. Begin doubting all of my perceptions cause I started adding my symptoms up on google and they fit the description of early schizophrenia. I started reading vigorously on google about schizophrenia and psychosis and started realizing that I need to get help ASAP. Well I thought it could wait for about 2 weeks and requested a week off of work 2 weeks in advance. My symptoms the week before I was gonna get help were getting really really severe. I started becoming paranoid of people I once trusted, would stare off into space for almost 10 minutes at a time with my mind racing, was only getting about 3 hours of sleep, and people would talk to me but my brain wouldnt process what they were telling me so I’d just nod. Well finally my week off of work came and that Friday night my anxiety levels were through the roof. I could not slow my brain down and could not calm myself down. I texted my older brother and told him I think I have schizophrenia, I’m going to the hospital. He called me and calmed me down so I turned my car around and went home. I finally got some sleep. The next morning I woke up and felt great. I was very happy, optimistic, and was thinking I didn’t need help. Then all of a sudden I had a thought about being crazy and schizophrenic and got SUPER paranoid. Like this paralyzing fear that was so overwhelming I can’t even describe it. My ears were ringing it was so bad. Had this feeling for about 3 hours and called my brother but I couldn’t calm down. I was getting ready to leave the house but was so paranoid I was scared to leave my bedroom. After staring at the door nob for about 10 minutes with my brother on the phone asking if I was okay I got the courage to leave the house. I went over to my parents house and had the king of all meltdowns. They took me to the behavioral center where I stayed for 24 hours. I was diagnosed with “Major Depression with psychotic features, anxiety, and mood congruent delusions.” 7 months later and I’m doing pretty good, I still have my days but I stick to a very strict routine. I never EVER skip my medication. I take seroquel, zoloft, and gabapentin. I haven’t been told I’m a schizophrenic yet but I fit pretty much every sign. Isolation, lack of motivation, lack of desire to socialize, trouble with memory and concentrating, feeling disconnected from everything, not being able to organize my thoughts, doubting my perceptions sometimes, seeing stuff out of the corner of my eyes then looking and there’s nobody there, and being lost in thought nearly all day everyday. To some up my post yes, stress can cause schizophrenia or similar disorders from my experience. I went from a motivated, outgoing, happy, trusting,optimistic, and cheerful person to almost the opposite due to stress and intense abuse.",schizophrenia
1024,"""Insanity"" does not have a clear and consistent definition these days, and is considered by many to be an offensive term. However, I will assume that you refer to psychosis, a state in which a person's thoughts are distorted to the point where they become disconnected from reality.

Yes, depression can develop into psychosis. The typical psychiatric term for this would be a ""Major depressive episode with psychotic features"", though it can also be an episode of bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. The patient will usually experience hallucinations and delusions that are congruent with their depressed mood. Examples I have heard are of visions of black crows following the person everywhere, or a belief that everybody in the world is about to die or is already dead, despite any evidence to the contrary.

In a study done in 2011 of 2500 people with depression, 5.4% had psychotic features [1].

Psychotic depression responds well to electroconvulsive therapy, or to a combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants. People who receive effective treatment often experience complete remission, but without treatment episodes can last for years, and the risk of suicide is high.

I dont think depression directly constitutes insanity, although at time im sure it feels like it! Adding to such stress with more worries about the depression leading to other forms of mental illness just adds more stress. Its vicious circle of the mind.

It’s pretty terrifying to see or experience. I’ve seen it twice in three or so years of working in residential mental health care. The usual course for it is an antipsychotic like seroquel combined with antidepressants.
It is important to do differential diagnosis for bipolar disorder. Mania and psychosis often occur together. I’ve seen psychotic depression misdiagnosed as bipolar 1. The solution worked because bipolar 1 requires an antipsychotic. It was just a waste of a mood stabilizer, required for bipolar and almost no other diagnosis, and unfortunate for the patient because mood stabilizers aren’t pleasant for the patient.",schizophrenia
1027,"I don't understand the intent of the question. How could it not be a “psychiatric” illness? The illness dominates the mind, thought processes, emotions, perceptions and all matter of mental processes!
UPDATE
In reponse to comments below:
My answer was not meant to separate “psychiatric disorders” from “physical illnesses.” The brain is an organ in the body. It is the most complex organ in the body. I am not meaning to be offensive or insulting towards you, but it is both amazing and disheartening to me that people still have trouble with this concept. A “brain disorder” is a physical illness. It is also a neurological disorder. People apparently are confused when they hear the term “mental illness” or “psychiatric disorder” as though it means that the mind is creating its problems outside of its physical entity. Our brains are responsible for all that we think, perceive, see, hear, smell, touch, taste. Everything that we see, everything that we do is a result of the functioning of our brain.
Our brains are so tremendously complex, that there are bound to be issues and variations in how it functions. Some people are color blind, some people are dyslexic, some people are savants, some people always see numbers in color (because the “wiring” for interpreting color and the “wiring” for interpreting numbers are in close proximity to one another in the brain, and somehow the “wiring” gets mixed up), some people have lower capacities to process information than others, some people suffer from schizophrenia, some people have problems with moods, some people are unable to feel physical pain, some people are unable to feel empathy. These ALL stem from the brain and the ways in which the various parts of the brain function and interact.
The term “psychiatric” does not mean that an illness is any less “real” or any less “biological” or “physical.” It simply refers to the workings of the human “psyche” which embody mind, perceptions, thought processes, etc.
As far as the term “psychosocial” is a term that is falling out of use as a criterion for determining “mental illness.” You are correct in your comments about non-medical criteria that this has been a socially defined means of labeling non-conformity. However, this is giving way to a medical/neuro-psychiatric view of brain disorders. There is resistance on the part of many psychotherapists who want to view mental illness as the result of social influences. But there is really no turning back the clock on the growing body of knowledge of the medical causes of brain disorders. Of course, our environment impacts the expression of any illness. Things like diet, sleep, and prolonged exposure to stress combine with biological predispositions and affect our physiological health on all levels.",schizophrenia
1028,"I’m not schizophrenic, but I was once put on medication that made me experience similar symptoms—and when my psychiatrist told me to quit cold turkey, the symptoms worsened.
In short? It was hell.
I became extremely paranoid and believed that everyone hated me and wanted me dead. My skin crawled and itched so much that I scratched my arms raw trying to relieve the sensation. I started hearing things that weren’t there: wind chimes, high-pitched buzzing, frightened whispers of children.
“Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?”
I spent most of the first day of withdrawals curled up in bed with the lights off and a pillow shoved over my head, sobbing. The second day was a little better; I was able to go downstairs to interact with my family, but I was very unresponsive to most of their questions and the extent of my interaction with them was a long, blank stare.
Once the medication was out of my system, the symptoms disappeared, to my absolute and utter relief. It was one of the single most terrifying experiences of my life, even more so than my two encounters with death. I couldn’t trust what my own brain was telling me and thought I was going to go mad.

1029,"People with schizophrenia tend to be negative, and take what others are saying and doing to an absurd and ridiculous end. Many people’s worst fear is to be misunderstood,maligned or otherwise degraded because of an incorrect interpretation of their actions or statements. Persons suffering with schizophrenia can improve with cognitive therapy, but often this is not available in most communities. The overpriced pill option seems to be the method that most people are trained and able to treat the various mental illnesses. It takes a special person to successfully teach cognitive therapy, but anyone can prescribe a pill. The stigma is a double problem here, as people tend not to care about the physical health of someone with a mental illness. If people with cancer were referred to as cancerous, or people with heart disease were referred to as heart diseased - the stigma would be there as well for people with cancer and heart disease then treatment funding and the care and concern these people have concerning their illness would be as bad as people with mental illnesses. People suffering from a mental illness live twenty five years less than people without a mental illness. The medications that are used to treat mental illnesses are very harmful to people’s health, yet this is not talked about, nor is any serious attempt made to incorporate cognitive therapy. People suffering with an mental illness need to stop referring to themselves and others, as mentally ill. The same for those who are involved in the treatment of people with a diagnosed mental illness. This would go a long way to helping to find a better cure for the illness, and reduce the stigma people have of persons with a mental illness. Stigmas are as well bad for the person who has the stigma, and can lead to undue stress, and confusion.",schizophrenia

If you knew that he managed to get as far as getting his Masters in Neuropsychology and was on his way to getting a PhD and then had to quit because he couldn’t focus anymore, you wouldn’t say it’s a gift.
If you discovered that, after he died, he had been smoking packs and packs of cigarettes to try to organize his thinking and drinking bottles and bottles of beer to self-medicate, you wouldn’t say it’s a gift.
If you knew how much we had to deal with over the years, with hospitals, committing him, watching him suffer, living with him, and knowing that a wonderful, brilliant man had to go through what he went through, you wouldn’t say it’s a gift.
Because if you knew that he never asked to be ill and that he wanted a wife and family and a normal life, you would never say it’s a gift.
Michael, in his more “normal” moments, was sweet, funny, and kind and never, EVER violent. He had an illness that, to this day, has no cure. It’s not a gift.

1031,"Neurological disorders stem from physical evidences whereas psychiatric disorders do not.
They are two different systems of categorizing human experiences. Neurology is a branch of medical science which attempts to study the physical and functional aspects of the nervous system (including the brain), with ‘disorders’ referring to disruptions in normal or healthy physical and functional traits. It is supposed to be an empirical study of human anatomy and functioning, to the extents it can manage that.
Psychiatry, on the other hand, is about ascribing psychosocial labels to experiences and behaviors using subjective parameters outside the boundaries of what is going on physically or functionally. It has nothing to do with the brain in any objectively evidence-based manner, despite psychological and behavioral traits ultimately finding their origin in the physicality of the mind.
Neurological disorders are defined by something going physically wrong, whether as ‘symptoms’ we don’t understand the etiology of or as observations of the way someone’s nervous system is functioning. Psychiatric disorders are value judgements about someone’s thoughts, feelings, choices, or actions which have no inherent connection to any physical phenomena in the brain or body.
So, “schizophrenia” is defined psychosocially, not neurologically. It is diagnosed and measured for ‘improvement’ psychosocially, not neurologically. There is no 1:1 match of “schizophrenia” to any physical traits, and it has been strongly suggested that “schizophrenia” is not any one collection of physical or functional traits. No physical features can prove or disprove a diagnosis of “schizophrenia”—it is a non-falsifiable social designation, not a scientific claim about someone’s physical traits.
And not only does “schizophrenia” lack a uniform physical basis, there is also no evidence of it being a physical disorder when we examine the traits sometimes associated with diagnoses. It is not a neurological category, and it is also not a category of physical disorder or ailment. Certainly some features are liable to be considered ‘atypical’, but typicality does not define a brain working as it evolved to, or in attempts to maintain physical homeostasis or psychological wellbeing.
There should be no surprise that there is no proof of neurological disorder in “schizophrenia” because that was never the kind of idea that “schizophrenia” was trying to communicate. It is a psychosocial label which refers to psychosocial traits organized subjectively and having no dependence upon what is going on in someone’s brain. Trying to retroactively assign particular brain traits to “schizophrenia” is like talking about the neurology of demon possession.
Simply put, they are two different and conflicting philosophies of how to define and respond to experiences.",schizophrenia
1032,"Tough question. Consider:
Neurological disorders included epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and types of dementia including Alzheimer's disease. Psychiatric disorders included things like depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, ADHD, and yes, autism.
Neurological disorders have be clearly related to physiology. For psychiatric disorders, the physiology component is obscure/unknown. This suggests that stuff (neurological vs psychiatric issues) get categorizes based on whether some chemical/biological basis is known or not.
The above also suggests that if the chemistry/biology behind schizophrenia were elucidated, the classification would move from a psychiatric to a neurological disorder.",schizophrenia
1033,"Because there is no medical pathology inherent to experiences labeled as “schizophrenia”.
There is no physical illness present, at least insofar as doctors have defined or detected. “Schizophrenia” cannot, for instance, be a neurological illness because there is no neurological definition of “schizophrenia” and no statement of illness built into the “schizophrenia” concept. It is just a hodgepodge collection of psychosocial boundaries which ultimately refer to a heterogeneous variety of differing physical and psychological dynamics. There is no physical “schizophrenia”.
Psychiatry has historically been keen on picking up a lot of the psychological, sociological, and behavioral concerns that medical science has discarded as non-pathological. Firstly, because some people labeled as “psychiatrically disordered” (aka “mentally ill”) sometimes need help, and that means industry is economically viable. Secondly, because psychiatrists are part of how society controls its members when individuals have preferences which conflict with those of more powerful people and parties.
Psychiatry invented “schizophrenia” — it was not some condition that got passed around and rejected by everyone else, psychiatry created it to serve their own agenda. Experiences presently labeled by some professionals as “schizophrenia” have had many different other kinds of labels in the past (as well as having a variety of contemporary labels). As it is a label referring to experiences which were not all consolidated into one place in other paradigms, it is also an interpretation that is distinct from preceding concepts.
So, why is “schizophrenia” a “psychiatric illness”?
Because psychiatry invented it, for psychiatric use and purposes.
Because it isn’t “illness” in any physically pathological sense.
Because enough people run with the concept for it to be a valuable tool for people looking to get paid — clinicians, researchers, drug manufacturers, insurance providers, and so forth.
Though “schizophrenia” is not one of the most recent editions to the psychiatric codex of “psychopathologies”, there was a time before it was invented that different terms and interpretations were used within psychiatry. The diagnostic criteria are still open to amendment, and psychiatric concepts change from one time and place to another because they are culturally determined rather than being physical descriptions that would hold across cultural lines. It is likely that “schizophrenia” will eventually be abandoned in favor of a new set or series of labels and accompanying diagnostic concepts.",schizophrenia
1034,"I know everyone is on this new philosophy that every single mental disorder or physical disorder is considered a “gift”. I have ADHD and an anxiety disorder and I just read a few weeks ago this ridiculous article about how ADHD is not considered something you want to “get rid of” or “get better from” but instead a gift that you should encourage people with ADHD to embrace and celebrate. They claim that telling kids with ADHD to get on meds to correct the problem is “telling them there is something wrong with them” instead of celebrating their “uniqueness”. It’s ridiculous. ADHD symptoms interfere with my day to day life, cause me to lose friendships, cause problems when I misplace things (like my phone, wallet, keys, important documents) keep me up at night because my brain can’t stop and then I get sick from lack of sleep, cause me to do poorly at work which can cause me to get fired. I can’t fulfill dreams I have, like traveling the world. So, without medication, ADHD is NOT something that is to be celebrated. It’s a disorder, something in the brain that was not supposed to be there. The PERSON should be celebrated, but not the disease.
Let me ask you this question…if you broke your leg, would you celebrate that? Would you tell the doctor “Don’t fix my leg. I consider my broken leg to be a gift. How dare you tell me that my broken leg is considered something that needs to be fixed, and not celebrated!” No, you get it fixed because you recognize that a broken leg is something that was not part of the original design, and it interferes with your ability to function in day-to-day activities.
Same thing with mental disorders. Any time something interferes with someone’s life in a negative way, it’s not a good thing. Hearing voices, seeing things that aren’t there, it can be dangerous. People have died because they have delusions that they can fly, some voice in their head told them to murder somebody, things that aren’t really there somehow got them into a vulnerable situation. Or, the people who were in their life became alienated, the person lost all their friends, and fell into depression.
I feel like I need to clarify. The PERSON with a disability should ALWAYS be celebrated. If the PERSON with the disability says “I like the way I am. I want to celebrate my condition as a part of me.” Then of course, celebrate with that person! It’s their disability after all. But it’s kind of a slap in the face to tell someone with a disability to “celebrate their disability because it makes you unique” because more likely than not, that person is NOT celebrating. They are probably struggling internally in ways you can’t imagine. Always celebrate the person, though. Because of their battle, they are likely very strong and resiliant.",schizophrenia
1035,"There is some data, that suggests, that schizophrenia may become at any time “neurological” illness and to be treated by neurologists. Some researchers believe, that the problem, that the disease, we call schizophrenia today is the way we look at it. It is not a single disease(from biological and neurological perspective), but a complex of a few diseases and each has its own different ethiology(cause of origin). Thus and the approach of treatment should become different. Not to mention, that, on genetical level, it appears to be 8 different diseases and one of the approach should be gene therapy. Also, adding stem cells for treatment of the negative symptoms, that result from reduction of gray and white brain matter because of the disease.",schizophrenia
1036,"I think the difference is historical because schizophrenia is now seen as a brain disorder.
Neurological diseases are disorders of the nerves and brain and psychiatric diseases are mental diseases. Essentially, neurology looks at signs whereas psychiatry looks at symptoms:
A symptom is any subjective evidence of disease, while a sign is any objective evidence of disease. Therefore, a symptom is a phenomenon that is experienced by the individual affected by the disease, while a sign is a phenomenon that can be detected by someone other than the individual affected by the disease. For examples, anxiety, pain, and fatigue are all symptoms. In contrast, a bloody nose is a sign of injured blood vessels in the nose that can be detected by a doctor, a nurse, or another observer. http://www.medicinenet.com/symptoms_and_signs/symptomchecker.htm#introView
The diagnosis of a neurological disease is based on tests, but the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on behavior. We don’t have tests, e.g. brain scans, that can definitively demonstrate the difference between a normal brain and a schizophrenic brain, and there are no changes that an autopsy can find comparable to the degeneration of an Alzheimer’s brain.
For most of its history psychoanalytic theory was dominant in psychiatry, to the point that many non-behavioral disorders (e.g. asthma, ulcers) were considered psychiatric. (Needless to say, many people with medical conditions were undertreated and research on some of them has been less than adequate.) Schizophrenia was assumed to be caused by “refrigerator mothers” or similar nonsense.
Schizophrenia is treated with drugs just as other medical diseases are.
I think neurology and psychiatry as fields will eventually merge, especially as diagnostic tools for schizophrenia and other mental diseases improve.

I couldn't sleep properly , I went to bed covered in water so if I was set on fire it might stop it. I couldn't eat certain things in case of poison. I lost my job , my relationship.

1038,"An event even just this past evening. I’m lying in bed trying to pray. Put yourself in my place. A shadowy demon with light around his edges comes to stand by your side and proceeds to choke you till you’re just barely able to gurgle. As blackness begins to take you and you’re trying to just cry out so others will hear your hoarse call - he disappears and you practically pass out.
Another time they come and sting my lips so that my mouth is swollen and my words are unintelligible. That’s the heavy stuff for me. Not so heavy but still tough is not knowing whether I can trust what I’m seeing, hearing, or even feeling. Maybe it’s a large rat that really isn’t there, or a giant spider that comes from a melting countertop. Or it’s just the whispers that I hear or the shouts, my name being called over a dead radio.
It’s the delusion. Feeling like I can tell the future and it’s all bad, I know that my family is going to die in flames - I can’t escape from my ability to tell the future. Even medicated I still unnaturally fear that I really did know the future.
There’s me having to call my husband practically in tears three times in a row because I “know” that I have a brain eating parasite; or I “know” that certain people are out to get me.
It’s an illness that has stained every part of my life. Thank God that medication has started to make a real improvement and has begun to give me my life back; but the last few days have reminded me of how bad this illness can be. I would never say it’s worse than the others, but it can be sheer hell.",schizophrenia
1039,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends.

Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, and coordinated specialty care services.

I’d like to clarify that the people with the illness are not a “problem” and too many people suffering this condition feel that way. They’re not a burden, they have a sickness.
I’m not sure if you’re a troll or not, but I’m going to treat this as a serious question.
Perhaps you don’t know, but proposing schizophrenia to be a “gift” is… insulting.
How exactly is schizophrenia a gift? How is hearing voices, seeing demon creatures, believing yourself to be pursued by “people with guns” (as one of my mother’s patients said) a “gift”?
A constant voice in the back of your head. Not only distracting, but whispering horrible things to you. Not just a noise, a negative presence.
You can’t sleep because you see shadow people in the corner of the room, you hear noises and the voices are screaming at you now. Screaming and saying that you’re “worthless” and that “nobody ever loved you”, over and over. They don’t stop.
I can’t even begin to understand how terrifying that must be. It is far, far from a gift.
These people are scared and alone. They are forced to believe the things in their head. They think they’re going to die or that they hurt someone or that they are possessed by a demon. They almost never believe positive things, I assure you.
It’s not a gift.",schizophrenia
1042,"As one living with schizophrenia, I can tell you it is a lonely life. I tend to isolate a lot so I am certain when I go into hallucination mode that I am really having hallucinations and I am not hearing ""real"" voices or seeing things (like rats climbing the walls).
I know isolating isn't the answer, and I give every effort to have a social life. For example, two months ago I went to see a real movie for the first time in 35 years. I had an understanding friend with me, and that made all the difference. It's just something about being in an enclosed space with lots of people in almost total darkness.
I have been in therapy for most of my life, and am taking medications as prescribed. I have finally found a great therapist and excellent psychiatrist who have saved my life several times over.
With that background info, to more directly answer your question as to the complications of schizophrenia would include:
Financial ruin (I have been bankrupt three times);
Social awkwardness to the point of having only one or two friends at any time. both of whom understand my condition as best they can; and
A very short life span. I am not expected to live past 60 years of age, because current medications are so toxic if taken long enough.",schizophrenia
1043,"Because you are detached from the living present; you cannot tell what is fiction, and what is reality. I could go on and on about how the symptoms of schizophrenia can be so debilitating and severe, but I think it suffice to say that since we are outside the shared reality, it is very, very severe.
Keep in mind, though, that each person's schizophrenia and psychosis is different from another's experience. And also that psychosis is more of a spectrum. But regardless of how bad you have it, it still is devastating to that person and often times the family. I would classify myself as more high-functioning, but I still go through challenges each and every day. Whether they be paranoia, delusions, hallucinations, or lack of speech, they still interfere with my daily life. And like I said, I got lucky with my prognosis because we caught it so early on. Without my catatonic behavior, I don't know if we would have caught it in time before something really bad happened.",schizophrenia

1047,"Schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects less than one percent of the U.S. population. When schizophrenia is active, symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, trouble with thinking and lack of motivation. However, with treatment, most symptoms of schizophrenia will greatly improve and the likelihood of a recurrence can be diminished.While there is no cure for schizophrenia, research is leading to innovative and safer treatments. Experts also are unraveling the causes of the disease by studying genetics, conducting behavioral research, and using advanced imaging to look at the brain’s structure and function. These approaches hold the promise of new, and more effective therapies.
The complexity of schizophrenia may help explain why there are misconceptions about the disease. Schizophrenia does not mean split personality or multiple-personality. Most people with schizophrenia are not any more dangerous or violent than people in the general population. While limited mental health resources in the community may lead to homelessness and frequent hospitalizations, it is a misconception that people with schizophrenia end up homeless or living in hospitals. Most people with schizophrenia live with their family, in group homes or on their own.Research has shown that schizophrenia affects men and women fairly equally but may have an earlier onset in males. Rates are similar around the world. People with schizophrenia are more likely to die younger than the general population, largely because of high rates of co-occurring medical conditions, such as heart disease and diabetes.

1048,"Neurologists focused on those brain disorders with cognitive and behavioural abnormalities that also presented with somatic signs—stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and so forth—while psychiatrists focused on those disorders of mood and thought associated with no, or minor, physical signs found in the neurological examination of the motor and sensory systems—schizophrenia, depression, anxiety disorders, and so on. For certain disorders, conflicting theories emerged about their aetiology and pathogenesis, at times engendering negative attitudes among workers in one or the other field, including derision and incivility. In academic medical centres, separate departments were formed in neurology and psychiatry that had little interest in collaboration in research, teaching, or patient care.Those specialists who supported a more holistic view of these disciplines were in full retreat by midcentury.

1050,"I can only answer this from the point of view of a mother of a son who has schizophrenia. I first noticed a deep, dark depression, worse than any depression he’d ever had. He withdrew from everything and everyone, wouldn’t answer phone, texts or emails. Then he lost his girlfriend and job. His girlfriend told me she thought maybe he was manic or something. He routinely posted gibberish on facebook, phrases that didn’t make any sense and often with made-up words. Next, his roommates kicked him out because he couldn’t pay his rent. I brought him home and that’s when he went completely psychotic. He told me his thoughts got blocked, that he was hearing voices and his behavior had just become totally erratic. He would get lost when he left the house. He became unable to function in the real world. He agreed to go to the ER and he’s been in therapy/on meds ever since. He exhibited most, if not all of the classic symptoms of the disorder.",schizophrenia
1051,"It’s definitely gonna vary from person to person, so I can only speak from my own experience.
Usually what I’ll notice at first is increased anxiety and obsessive thought. Now this one can be kind of tough to spot because I’m already quite obsessive and anxious. But if I notice I’m starting to question things far out of the norm, then I see it as a warning sign.
For instance, if I begin to sift through memories looking for inconsistencies in the fabric of them it’s a sign. If I begin to question reality, it’s because I’m slipping. It can be quite tough because all logical thought is slipping away from you. You aren’t thinking through things step by step. Your taking leaps and stumbling all over the damn place with your reasoning. You take something like a lack of birds chirping in the morning as a sign that your whole life is a tv show.
Next is the emotional differences. Some people lose their emotion during psychosis, and that happens to me only at the very peak of the episode. Before then there is this rising fear and paranoia that I can feel inside me. Not just fear about walking down a dark hallway, I believe that while that’s irrational, it’s not quite psychotic. I’m talking like refusing to eat or drink because you believe the government is poisoning your food and trying to kill you.

1053,"Schizophrenia is a challenging disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally.
In some people, schizophrenia appears suddenly and without warning. But for most, it comes on slowly, with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning long before the first severe episode.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia
In this early phase of schizophrenia, you may seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive to others. You may start to isolate yourself, begin neglecting your appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. You may abandon hobbies and activities, and your performance at work or school can deteriorate.
Most common early warning signs include:
Depression, social withdrawal
Hostility or suspiciousness, extreme reaction to criticism
Deterioration of personal hygiene

Inability to cry or express joy or inappropriate laughter or crying
Oversleeping or insomnia; forgetful, unable to concentrate

1055,"Yes, people with schizophrenia can know they have schizophrenia. The major hurdle is overcoming the denial about having the disease. A person with schizophrenia might know that things aren’t right, they might go to a doctor and get diagnosed, but the delusions associated with the disease can make it hard to accept having the illness. On the one hand, you have your brain telling you that everything is a huge conspiracy and that the doctors are really secret agents, and on the other hand you have doctors and family telling you you have a severe mental illness, so it is hard to figure out which scenario to believe.
However, when someone is medicated it is much easier to know that you have the illness, but it is still hard to accept that such an awful disease is happening to you. Then you have millions of dumb internet trolls talking about how schizophrenia isn’t real or how you can cure it with vitamins and exercise, so of course someone would want to believe they don’t really have this horrible disease.
That is why many of us who have mental illness, schizophrenia in particular, feel it is important to be open and share our stories about having schizophrenia. The stigma surrounding the disease creates problems in addition to the disease itself, but we CAN do something about the stigma by speaking up.
It took me a long time to really accept my illness, and I’m quite sure I wouldn’t have ever fully accepted it if I had not had medications. The delusions can be quite strong. But, yes, I would say most people with schizophrenia know on some level there is something wrong. It is a long road to acceptance sometimes.",schizophrenia
1056,"If your experience going through life is causing you significant distress, and you are genetically predisposed to schizophrenia, and IF you are introspective, insightful, and honest with yourself, with an internal locus of control - then yes it is possible for someone to be self aware that they might be suffering from schizophrenia. Of course you’re not supposed to diagnose yourself, see a professional, but if someone is heading towards psychosis it is possible to recognize it. Most people, however, don’t question their own perceptions and interpretations and beliefs, so these people who are confident and unwavering in their own “rightness” - these people sleepwalk through their lives thinking whatever they think, believing whatever works for them, not questioning their reality, and they are all addicted to the energy exchange (among other things that they think will fill the void within) that occurs between people as they manipulate and deceive each other by first manipulating and deceiving themselves.

That very information is susceptible to manipulation and distortion by the sources of the information AND by each of us who are already searching for information that confirms and validates our pre-established beliefs and interpretations. Everyone is the sole witness to their own existence… nobody is right or wrong, good or evil, rich or poor, happy or sad… when humanity is gone.. maybe we’ll be “one with God” (that sounds terrible) or maybe it will be like we never existed at all? Maybe the universe is perpetually recycling the same consciousness as it goes through the process of emerging into existence via the laws of physics and evolution.
I Don’t Know.. people can manifest themselves into divinity apparently.. or Atleast place their bid.. Religion is mind control. It was necessary to get us to where we are now, and Science is our attempt at rationalizing ourselves into “playing God” by uncovering the mystery of the universe and achieving some kind of utopian existence.

We’re afraid of darkness and the unknown and the concept of infinity is incomprehensible because we all know deep down that we have a beginning and an end..and no one really can wrap their head around what it’s like not to exist because existing is all we’ve ever done.. so it’s human nature to deceive ourselves into believing in an afterlife (transcendence) and give ourselves justification for committing atrocities “in the name of God” so they can sleep at night knowing they are morally superior and doing whatever they do for the “greater good”… if they feel guilty about it later, well that’s why you pray, go to confession, and absolve yourself of sin. Do whatever you believe is “right” and have “faith” that God will judge you fairly in the afterlife.
Shits scary. If the earth had a consciousness of its own.. I think it would be afraid of humanity… we’re kind of awful.",schizophrenia
1057,"In the initial phase, they can experience that everything that is happening around them is directed towards them and have a sinister meaning. Then, they become withdrawn and become suspicious towards people around them. They start talking about some odd beliefs for eg. they have supernatural powers, there is some conspiracy going on to kill them etc. They start experiencing hallucinations, commonly auditory hallucinations where they hear some noises or voices. There are other forms of schizophrenia where patients thought process may be jumbled up and speech may be incomprehensible. Because of above preoccupations there job performance/academic performance/family and social life gets disturbed.",schizophrenia
1058,"“Can""? Yes people with schizophrenia can be aware of their mental illness. Though it is also common for those with schizophrenia not to believe they have it even if they have been diagnosed. I'd argue that sometimes that's a normal response to an unfavorable situation. I'm diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (which has symtoms of schizophrenia and a mood disorder as well), but when I first started hearing the voices I believed they were spirits. It was how I explained my unusual experiences. It's much easier to believe that than it is to believe that it could be a mental illness, especially a chronic one like schizoaffective disorder. My parents, who are not mentally ill themselves, are still in this denial phase. They believe it could still be spiritual because they want to believe that it is curable and that there is something that WE can do to cure it. But nonetheless, where I am right now, I understand that the evidence for my symtoms being mental is much greater than the evidence for it being spiritual. And now that I've come to accept that (at least for the most part though at times I still find myself wondering if it could be spiritual) I can move forward in working to minimize and treat my symtoms.",schizophrenia
1059,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time. It started to take a toll on my health. I lost a lot of weight. I was contently dying. I got thrown out of most of the motels in town, and was running out of places to go.
As the disorder progressed so did my perception of reality. I realized the problem was much much worse. However, once I discovered a paradigm that made sense I ma...

1060,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
1061,"I remember waking up that night. Something did not feel right. I looked to my right to see a hideous rotting corpse staring at me. I’ll never be able to forget it. It didn’t go away for a while. I tried ignoring what had happened. Then I started to see and hear other things that weren’t there. I was 44 at the time.
I’ve always been a relatively healthy person, in shape, high functioning and outgoing. I just figured I was over stressed or needed more sleep. I knew I had adhd and just assumed that was getting worse - which was actually true.
And then after a hypertensive crisis, I broke.
I was diagnosed when I was still very sick and I could barely understand what my psychiatrist was telling me. I had only recently been discharged from a hospital. Fortunately my husband was there with me and when he sensed I was lucid enough a few days later he told me the news. I had late onset schizophrenia.
Initially it was nice to have some answers. I was very hopeful that I could get some relief now. What followed was a rough period of testing out medication and combinations of medications. It took a fair amount of time. I was able to live a mostly normal life for a littke while- which was when my youngest child needed me most. Unfortunately I am relapsing again and it’s very hard to deal with.",schizophrenia
1062,"There are many circumstances that can cause people to become psychotic. As mentioned in previous answers, depression, anxiety and substance abuse can cause this. I’m most of these cases they are not permanent but can have lasting effects such as depersonalization derealization disorder, which is where you can feel disconnected from your body or from your surroundings (however this is not a psychotic disorder). Some may also develop ptsd from traumatic events and memories during the psychosis.
I believe that if someone is displaying psychotic symptoms, before any medication is started, to make sure they get an eeg which can shows abnormal electrical activity in the brain. If there is abnormal electrical activity, it can rule out many possibilities and indicate a seizure disorder.
Though this may be a rare case, it happened to me. I was admitted to the child and adolescent psych unit when I was 16 when I suffered a severe psychotic episode. It was not typical however because a lot of the time I would be aware the hallucinations were that— hallucinations and not real. I would find myself improving and my symptoms lessening only to resurface again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After being put on antipsychotics and having horrendous side effects and gaining 40 pounds I decided enough was enough. I didn’t believe I had bipolar, so I went to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with temporal lobe epilepsy and assured me I do not have bipolar or schizophrenia. I found out that non-convulsive seizures that were uncontrolled was what was causing my hallucinations. I was taken off the antipsychotics and put on anti seizure medication combined with an antidepressant. The combination of getting off the meds and starting new ones improved my quality of life immensely. Now I do not experience any hallucinations. I still struggle with anxiety, and depression on occasion, but I rarely have seizures anymore and if I do they are very minor in intensity compared to how they used to be.
I know this is an old thread but I think it is important for me to share my experience and hopefully help others who may be experiencing the same things I have and don’t have enough answers to their questions, and are receiving inadequate care for their condition(s).
Now I am going to be starting university in the fall in the field of psychology and achieved outstanding grades in my last year of high school which I never thought possible after my psychosis. I hope that this information can reach some people and show them that there is indeed hope.
Sending warm thoughts to all of you",schizophrenia
1063,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.
A very dear friend. A gem of a person. Wish the best for him, wherever he may be now.",schizophrenia
1064,With my Schizophrenia I was almost choked to death by an ex boyfriend and about 2 weeks later started hearing voices. My surroundings seem so bright like the world is fixing to blow up. I have uncontrollable laughing where I cannot stop laughing. I thought it was my brains way of trying to get better but I googled and it's from a traumatic brain injury. I cant sleep. So ashamed of the things I do. I remember doing them but dont know why I do them. Schizophrenia is sooo lonely. People either think you are faking it or treat you horribly. Not realizing your in your own living hell on earth.,schizophrenia
1065,"This is a very good question…
In mental health there are concepts called “insight” and “judgment,” and the two go hand in hand.
There are different domains to insight including;
1. Insight into a person’s own mental illness - Recognizing that they have a certain condition
2. Insight into the need for treatment and/or medication - Recognizing that they need help with their illness and whether or not they need to take medication
3. Insight into their actions in social situations and daily life - Recognizing the effects their illness has on their day-to-day life and how they interact with others and function in society
An individual’s insight will impact their judgment and the decisions they make in their daily life; whether they choose to seek help when needed, whether they choose to participate in therapy and/or take their medication regularly if needed, and whether they make choices that allow them to adapt and function well in society.
The level of insight a person with schizophrenia has is arguably one of the most important prognostic indicators of how severely their illness will limit their ability to lead a normal life. There are people with schizophrenia who have excellent insight, recognize that sometimes their thought process is disorganized, that the hallucinations they experience and their tendency to sometimes be withdrawn are part of their illness, and that they have a need to take medication.
In those individuals we sometimes say that “reality testing is intact.” In other words, at that moment in time they recognize what is real and what is part of their illness. This can fluctuate over the course of their lifetime, and during periods of stress or acute exacerbations, they may temporarily fail reality testing, but ultimately their illness will have a much better course and they will often lead happy, fulfilling, and productive lives. I have known physicians with schizophrenia, for example.

1066,"For me personally, I drank my way into psychosis. I had also stopped exercising and ate unhealthy food for some time.
I started going on long drives to clear my head and found myself reading truck labels as they passed by thinking they were trying to communicate with me.
I also thought that license plates on cars were meant to convey messages to me.
My long drives turned into a country wide road trip, that while really fun, was in retrospect very risky considering how often I drank and drove.
As I drank and traveled I thought that aliens and/or the government were trying to talk with me.
By the end of my trip, I stayed at a hotel in Long Island City for a few weeks. I would look out the window and watch trucks and cars drive by thinking that people were stalking me. I thought the TV was talking to and about me too.
Eventually I had enough and decided to call the police to report being stalked. They must've thought I was crazy because they called an ambulance to take me to a psych hospital. Then began my journey in and out of psych wards and homeless shelters.
So, to summarize, I didn't take care of my body for a long time and drank heavily, which I believe brought on several psychotic breaks.
I still get freaked out by cars and the TV but am now on meds that help with the psychosis I was experiencing. I also don't drink anymore and joined AA which has been psychologically helpful.
For all I know it's possible aliens and the government were trying to communicate with me and the only way I could prove it is to look for the patterns on TV, truck labels and license plates. I believe sometimes there are messages there, but then again I'm schizophrenic and the whole seeing messages thing could just be a self fulfilling prophecy.",schizophrenia
1067,"Schizophrenia is characterized by postive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought and speech and grossly abnormal motor behaviors. The negative symptoms accompany and often set the stage for these positive symptoms. Diminished emotional expression, abnormalities of facial contwnt of interactions and anhedonia or diminished ability to experience pleasure are two of the prominent aspects of negative symptoms. However, schizophrenia, in my understanding, is a disorder that occurs in a continuum. And this makes it very difficult to diagnose. Even experienced clinicians will pause before making that diagnosis. Schizophrenia often disguises itself in other types of mental disorders. To be sure you need to abide by the following criteria
At least one of the positive symptoms must have existed for a significant period of time during a 1 month period.
At least one of the negative symptoms must have existed for a significant period of time during that 1 month period.
Self care, work, social life must be markedly affected.
Signs of pathology must have presented for at least 6 months
Such disturbances must not be due to any other medical condition
But schizophrenia is quite symptomatic. If its is present there will be a significant shift in the behaviour and affect of the individual.",schizophrenia
1068,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia
1069,"below are some early warning signs of schizophrenia:
Trouble thinking clearly or concentrating
Suspiciousness or uneasiness with others
A decline in self-care or personal hygiene.
Spending a lot more time alone than usual.
Strong, inappropriate emotions or having no feelings at all
Signs Of Early Or First-Episode Psychosis:
Hearing, seeing, tasting or believing things that others don’t
Persistent, unusual thoughts or beliefs that can’t be set aside regardless of what others believe
Strong and inappropriate emotions or no emotions at all
Withdrawing from family or friends

Emotionally Flat
Withdrawn
Unable to incorporate feelings into reality
Auditory Hallucinations
Visual Hallucinations
Experiencing both 4 and 5 at the same time.
These are some of the Main symptoms of Schizophrenia. Psychological, Neuro Psycholigical Testing and interviews can provide additional indicators. As a Psychiatrist or a Psychotherapist knows a client better they will begin to pick up on this Disorder. Sometimes it is readily apparent, other times it is not and can be confused with other Disorders. Schizophrenia when correctly Diagnosed has Medications and CBT Therapy to help. It is a Psychosis. It cannot be cured. It will begin to appear around age 17. It has its own specific Neuroanatomy of the Brain. Reduced Grey Matter in the Pre Frontal, Medial and Superior Temporal Lobes. It is a Neurodevelopmental Disorder that has impaired Cognitive, Motor, and Social Function. Positive Neurobiological Structural Symptoms: The Amyglada, Hippocampus and Para Hippocampal Regions are affected. Negative Neurobiological Symptoms: Ventral Striatum and Medial Pre Frontal Cortex are affected.",schizophrenia
1071,"I can only answer this from the point of view of a mother of a son who has schizophrenia. I first noticed a deep, dark depression, worse than any depression he’d ever had. He withdrew from everything and everyone, wouldn’t answer phone, texts or emails. Then he lost his girlfriend and job. His girlfriend told me she thought maybe he was manic or something. He routinely posted gibberish on facebook, phrases that didn’t make any sense and often with made-up words. Next, his roommates kicked him out because he couldn’t pay his rent. I brought him home and that’s when he went completely psychotic. He told me his thoughts got blocked, that he was hearing voices and his behavior had just become totally erratic. He would get lost when he left the house. He became unable to function in the real world. He agreed to go to the ER and he’s been in therapy/on meds ever since. He exhibited most, if not all of the classic symptoms of the disorder.",schizophrenia
1072,"It’s definitely gonna vary from person to person, so I can only speak from my own experience.
Usually what I’ll notice at first is increased anxiety and obsessive thought. Now this one can be kind of tough to spot because I’m already quite obsessive and anxious. But if I notice I’m starting to question things far out of the norm, then I see it as a warning sign.
For instance, if I begin to sift through memories looking for inconsistencies in the fabric of them it’s a sign. If I begin to question reality, it’s because I’m slipping. It can be quite tough because all logical thought is slipping away from you. You aren’t thinking through things step by step. Your taking leaps and stumbling all over the damn place with your reasoning. You take something like a lack of birds chirping in the morning as a sign that your whole life is a tv show.
Next is the emotional differences. Some people lose their emotion during psychosis, and that happens to me only at the very peak of the episode. Before then there is this rising fear and paranoia that I can feel inside me. Not just fear about walking down a dark hallway, I believe that while that’s irrational, it’s not quite psychotic. I’m talking like refusing to eat or drink because you believe the government is poisoning your food and trying to kill you.
Now if your trying to see if a family member is going through psychosis, my mom once told me that I’m like “a cornered cat” 24/7.
Again that’s only my experience with it.",schizophrenia
1073,"Schizophrenia is a challenging disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally.
In some people, schizophrenia appears suddenly and without warning. But for most, it comes on slowly, with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning long before the first severe episode.
Late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia
In this early phase of schizophrenia, you may seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive to others. You may start to isolate yourself, begin neglecting your appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. You may abandon hobbies and activities, and your performance at work or school can deteriorate.
Most common early warning signs include:
Depression, social withdrawal
Hostility or suspiciousness, extreme reaction to criticism
Deterioration of personal hygiene
Flat, expressionless gaze
Inability to cry or express joy or inappropriate laughter or crying
Oversleeping or insomnia; forgetful, unable to concentrate
Odd or irrational statements; strange use of words or way of speaking",schizophrenia
1074,"I always over thought things as a child,I wouldn't go to a party once as I was convinced they'd all be angry with me because by turning up to the party it meant I was turning up begging for food. As I got older I had a lot of anxiety I was always on the move then I had a dose of what I thought at the time was depression as I went from being on the move to not having the energy to do anything,I was sleeping but not sleeping. I then started having thoughts that if I just touched people I could cure cancer. I was still functioning but not very well. There was also a woman in my head who spoke calmly to me. She wasn't my thoughts she was a woman about 40 who spoke to me. I then moved on impulse away from my family and friends. I started believing there were devil worshippers outside and I started neglecting my personal hygiene and my home. I thought demons were going to kill me, but I didn't dare tell anyone about it because if I spoke it out loud to anyone they would kill me because I'd confirmed that I knew they were planning it. As I'd moved away it was easy to decline in my mental health. I then had someone outside of me putting blasphemous thoughts in my head, they weren't my thoughts, they were forcing me to have them in my head but they weren't mine. It's hard to describe, I wasn't thinking them, they were there but I knew what they said.The woman had been more active in my head but by this time she had stopped speaking to me. The outside force was also kind of ‘twirling’ that's the best way to describe it, it's hard to describe a lot as my head was so jumbled, my thoughts and vanishing them and forcing their thoughts on me. I was still functioning but it was very difficult. Things declined from there. I didn't hear many voices, I was more delusional and felt my mind was being messed with by demons and an outside force. They used to make me believe I was going to kill people etc and made me feel they were trying to force me to do it. My mental health kept declining from there on.",schizophrenia
1075,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.

1076,"In the initial phase, they can experience that everything that is happening around them is directed towards them and have a sinister meaning. Then, they become withdrawn and become suspicious towards people around them. They start talking about some odd beliefs for eg. they have supernatural powers, there is some conspiracy going on to kill them etc. They start experiencing hallucinations, commonly auditory hallucinations where they hear some noises or voices. There are other forms of schizophrenia where patients thought process may be jumbled up and speech may be incomprehensible. Because of above preoccupations there job performance/academic performance/family and social life gets disturbed.",schizophrenia

1078,When I was in psychosis I didn't know.. I just believed I was being gangstalked and assaulted. I just had to get proof though I never could. It wasn't until a few visits to the psych ward and a general doctors appointment where I got the diagnosis and even then I didn't believe it. It's strange you know your mind doesn't allow you to comprehend new things when in psychosis and the diagnosis just seemed like they doctors had no clue. Well that's what I believed at the time. Now that I've been on medication for a few years I can safely say I agree with the doctors.. I do have schizophrenia. From time to time I experience hallucinations but I know they're not real after it happens. It's usually quite scary and not of the norm. Like for instance when I drive to the servo I'll see a dead body on the side of the road or a dead dog in the middle of the road just as I drive over it. I don't see it in the distance just last minute. It scares me for a minute then i know it wasn't real. Fortunately I don't have these issues often so I'm relieved thanks to medication.,schizophrenia
1079,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time. It started to take a toll on my health. I lost a lot of weight. I was contently dying. I got thrown out of most of the motels in town, and was running out of places to go.
As the disorder progressed so did my perception of reality. I realized the problem was much much worse. However, once I discovered a paradigm that made sense I ma...

1080,"If you go after Emil Kraepelin, a German doctor shizopphrenia has 4 stages
The first stage is shown by retreat and colapse of the social environment.
The second stage is shown by Paranoia which manifests in feeling followed or just the feeling that people constantly talk bad about you.
The third stage is shown by not responding to emotions people would expect you to like f.e. laughing when you actually should cry and you articulate incorehently.
The people who are in the fourth stage repeat actions all over again for hours, f.e. looking at the wall and saying a name or something like that.

1081,"There are many circumstances that can cause people to become psychotic. As mentioned in previous answers, depression, anxiety and substance abuse can cause this. I’m most of these cases they are not permanent but can have lasting effects such as depersonalization derealization disorder, which is where you can feel disconnected from your body or from your surroundings (however this is not a psychotic disorder). Some may also develop ptsd from traumatic events and memories during the psychosis.
I believe that if someone is displaying psychotic symptoms, before any medication is started, to make sure they get an eeg which can shows abnormal electrical activity in the brain. If there is abnormal electrical activity, it can rule out many possibilities and indicate a seizure disorder.
Though this may be a rare case, it happened to me. I was admitted to the child and adolescent psych unit when I was 16 when I suffered a severe psychotic episode. It was not typical however because a lot of the time I would be aware the hallucinations were that— hallucinations and not real. I would find myself improving and my symptoms lessening only to resurface again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After being put on antipsychotics and having horrendous side effects and gaining 40 pounds I decided enough was enough. I didn’t believe I had bipolar, so I went to a new psychiatrist who diagnosed me with temporal lobe epilepsy and assured me I do not have bipolar or schizophrenia. I found out that non-convulsive seizures that were uncontrolled was what was causing my hallucinations. I was taken off the antipsychotics and put on anti seizure medication combined with an antidepressant. The combination of getting off the meds and starting new ones improved my quality of life immensely. Now I do not experience any hallucinations. I still struggle with anxiety, and depression on occasion, but I rarely have seizures anymore and if I do they are very minor in intensity compared to how they used to be.
I know this is an old thread but I think it is important for me to share my experience and hopefully help others who may be experiencing the same things I have and don’t have enough answers to their questions, and are receiving inadequate care for their condition(s).
Now I am going to be starting university in the fall in the field of psychology and achieved outstanding grades in my last year of high school which I never thought possible after my psychosis. I hope that this information can reach some people and show them that there is indeed hope.

1082,"My biggest sign was people was following me to harm me, secondary was they was talking about me and laughing at me.
I went through a divorce.
I did odd things like walking down the road with out shirt and shoes. I skipped from spot to spot on the road.
I was hyper and talk alot aimlessly to my father and nonsensical indirectly to my neighbour. I wanted to lose weight and was exercising a lot.
i had difficulty sleeping.
When i walked up the step to work, I felt a huge pain in my groin area making walking difficult.
My work was affected i rowed in a loud voice with no one in particular. My work relationship was affected. I was reported to Human Resource. I resigned been unable to function normally.
The reason i resigned too was i was afraid i will not feel better.
I row with my mother alot (care giver) without reason.
My mother took me forceable to the hospital where i was admitted for two weeks and sedated.
On release from hospital i was given medication which i still use dutifully.
I am trying to cope with the side effects of the medication, one of which is over sleep roughly two days every week. The doctor said that was a good thing (sleep) I did not argue.
During the course of recovery i had to deal with the public perception and still do.
Now that i am feeling a lot better, it helps me to chronicle the past with a view to understanding my condition in a revelant forum. I am always interested in reading and researching the sickness. I reach a lot of similar people at my clinic and identify with them.
I can now articulate myself, that was difficult plus the interest to articulate was not there on the onset of my sickness.
In my case i suspected something was wrong to me before hand, on admission my care giver related to the doctor on my condition, I was clueless. During the course of attending clinic i related my feelings.
That was around age 40 i am now 52.
My psychiatrist never declared me oficially as having schizophrenia, my research is on going.
I do yoga regularly for the past six years and i am interested in anyone experience with recovery from schizophrenia (psychiartic disorder) using yoga",schizophrenia

I have uncontrollable laughing where I cannot stop laughing. I thought it was my brains way of trying to get better but I googled and it's from a traumatic brain injury. I cant sleep. So ashamed of the things I do. I remember doing them but dont know why I do them. Schizophrenia is sooo lonely. People either think you are faking it or treat you horribly. Not realizing your in your own living hell on earth.,schizophrenia
1084,"I have been living with schizophrenia for some time and know very well that being prepared may help, but professional help is the best way.
The first two years, I had following symptoms:
Panic attacks
Disturbed sleep
Sleeping during the day and staying awake during the night
Mood swings
Hearing voices inside my head
Heightened sense of morality
No interest in cleanliness
Thinking i'm more important than I was
Withdrawn and moody at the workplace - tendency to vanish in the background and under performance
No interest in socializing
Being diagnosed with the disease helped me immensely, at least I knew what was wrong with me. I was glad that my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. In the long run, I have dissociated from psychiatric treatment and embraced symptomatic control techniques like meditation and deep breathing.",schizophrenia
1085,"The first signa could be a number of things from depression and panic attacks, to being withdrawn and having mild paranoia. That's whats called usually prodromal symptoms. You should get checked out if it's affecting your life even in the slightest before things head downhill really fast.
Also, definitely if someone is not sleeping much at all or having irrational fears of things that are really irrelevant to their life, lifestyle, family, or having increased interest in things they never would have. There's also lots of other signs. Tons. Anything out of the ordinary basically.
From personal experience, I was head over hills for art and music. Exclusively. I actually despised science. When I became 20 years old I fell hard for philosophy and science. I became interested, I mean. I started to become interested in stuff like government conspiracies, time travel, and existentialism. Things of the nature; dark and deep topics.",schizophrenia

They may think they hear God's voice. They may feel afraid that they're being followed and someone is out to harm them. They may worry that the government has bugged their phone or that their doctor is trying to poison them. Some people may see things that other people don't see, but this happens less often.",schizophrenia
1087,"The four stages or phases of schizophrenia can be labeled as:
The Prodromal Stage
The prodromal phase indicates the period from when the first change in a person occurs until he or she develops full-blown psychosis. In other words, it’s the time measure leading up to the first apparent psychotic episode.
2. The Acute Stage
The active phase, also termed the acute phase, is identified by hallucinations, paranoid delusions, and extremely disorganized speech and behaviors. During this stage, patients resemble very obvious psychotic disorder. If left untreated, active psychotic symptoms can last for weeks or months. Signs may improve to the case where the patient must enter the hospital for acute care and treatment.
3. The Remission Stage
After the intense activity of the symptoms resides they are said to have gone into remission. The intensity and appearance of the symptoms may decrease drastically and some may disappear altogether. With treatment, they can be kept at bay for long periods of time and normal functioning can continue for the most part. If you’re reading this with a sense of hope, please do feel hope and hang in there.
4. The Relapse Stages
The relapse stage is just the reappearance of the symptoms back to an acute level. This can be avoided or at least the damage minimized by continuing to follow the treatment plan laid out for you by your doctor. You can also become familiar with the feelings and signs of an impending relapse or psychotic episode and speak to your doctor right away. There may be ways to keep it at bay medically.
Thoughts on the Stages of Schizophrenia
Continue with your medication plan, stay in counseling and therapy, social support groups, and stay healthy in other ways. By doing this, the complications of schizophrenia can be held to a minimum.
The Stages of Schizophrenia | Schiz Life",schizophrenia
1088,"We speak of schizophrenia as potentially having three stages:
Prodromal;
Acute; and
Residual.
The Prodromal Stage is one of growing irritability, social breakdown, growing weirdness, where some symptoms are present, but entire disorder is not evident. There may be transient hallucinations, thought difficulties, and social withdrawal. This akin to the “coming down with a cold stage” where you may be sneezing, feel extremely tired, have some chills,a cough, but not be fully involved.
The Acute Stage occur where are full blown hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder, communication problems, and growing oddness of behavior. The specific form of the disorder fully emerges with its particular symptom pattern.
The Residual Stage occurs when the most flagrant symptomology is past. Hallucinations or delusions may no longer be present or are greatly diminished. Some communication problems may remain, motivation may be lowered, personal care may no be as sharp as prior to the disorder’s onset. Intellectually, the person may not be as sharp. This stage is akin to the “getting well” stage of a cold. You are still coughing a bit and your nose is still runny, but the worst is clearly past. You are still tired and feel worse at night, but overall you are greatly improved.",schizophrenia
1089,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
1090,"If you are not aware of your emotions and you have been taking medication for schizophrenia okay you’ve not analyse yourself but you’re taking tablets they’ve given to you has made your illness even worse
schizophrenia is emotions characteristics of the wrong people that hit a person who has worked for whoever they worked for and has picked up bad energies from other people and it affected them and they the emotions negativity and positivity. Unfortunately cannot be balanced out because negativity causes disruption, it causes anxiety, it causes hatred it causes racism, it causes fear , many illnesses come from it
you have positivity when you was young you only knew positivity. Yeah when you was young and you was free playing with your friends in the park you didn’t have worries and stress you had imaginary friends that would make you feel good. It’s not a sign that you’re going crazy every child in the world has imaginary friends, my one was Aurora ( means dawn ) My Daughter one was Anora ( you can look it up and see what that means ).
I do not follow people I follow my heart, and my heart is a lot pure than the people you follow",schizophrenia
1091,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.

1093,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.

My family and church had some weird ideas about me to begin with, but I took what they said and ran. I discovered that God, angels and demons could talk to me. They were trying to teach me a new language based more on conceptual thinking.
Along with that, I had bad negative symptoms. No energy, isolating,never wanting to do anything, no interest in anything, flat affect, out of place emotions, and I was a complete slob.
Also, I was raised in long term reaidential treatment centers, so I was watched constantly, and assessed and judged. That's just a fact.

1095,"Look at the other articles. There are different conditions that appear as relatives of the condition but are not classified as leading to schizophrenia, thus they are not stages per say. Some Individuals will have many episodes (usually the same or similar in nature) while others will hàve only one in their lifetime. Treatment is individual ànd needs to be based on specifics rather than on a more global diagnosis. Some can learn methods of self management and do well without medication as long as there are no pressures that lead to anxiety or bring up old issues. Most however need a combination of medication and support throughout life.
Do not attempt self diagnosis as that can further confuse the issues when you seek help for yourself or a loved one.",schizophrenia

For the first time in my life, I was tired. I was 14 years old. Before this, I could wake up for school and stay awake. I wasn’t quite a morning person, but I had no trouble staying awake after getting out of bed. This suddenly changed. I would be in class, and my eyes would start rolling in the back of my head without me even closing my eyes. I’d have microsleeps all day despite getting a full night of sleep. It felt terrible. I was constantly exhausted no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.
My feelings toward my family suddenly changed. I felt that they were against me in some way, I’d constantly argue with them. I was always on edge around them, I was afraid they would hurt me. This fear lead to me hating them for a bit, sadly.
I developed very odd rituals. If I did not throw ice cubes into my pool, I would die. Every time I went onto my back patio, ice had to be thrown into the pool.
I loved being alone during this time. I looked forward to being home alone, but once I was actually home alone, I still felt as though there were people there. I’d walk around the house asking who was there. I looked for cameras, as I thought my parents were trying to catch me doing something I was not supposed to do. I would look up at the ceiling and say things like, “I know you’re there.” “Stop recording me, I know what you’re doing”, ect.
I had what I called my “emotion breaks”, which were little voices that would pop into my head. If they said something mean, I’d think it was my anger trying to talk to me. If they said something happy, I’d think it was my happiness trying to talk to me. I believed that my emotions had come to life in my brain, and they were talking to me.
I had very odd moments of confusion. I would be doing my normal thing, like homework, and suddenly, my brain would shift. I would very suddenly believe something very strange. For example, one time I thought that there were secret tunnels in my house that lead to the mall, I thought I had to find them to get to the mall. I would get up and look for them, wandering around my house, then I would think myself out of it. I would start having rational thoughts, like “Have I ever seen the inside of these tunnels before?” “Wouldn’t I know where the entrance was?” “I thought I got to the mall by car” Then I would realize, after a few minutes, there really aren’t any tunnels.",schizophrenia
1097,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia
1098,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
1099,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.

After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.
Best wishes to all.",schizophrenia
1100,"Well the books say one thing…
As far as the illness itself goes, the first stage is when the genetic ‘spelling’ errors occur prior to birth. As a result, certain brain cells will not wind up in the right place, or will not be connected up correctly.
During the person’s young years he or she may feel shy, lost, awkward (both physically and socially), may have behavioral problems, may even have a few symptoms that seem like a mild or slight version of schizophrenia symptoms.
But most people with schizophrenia will not show really obvious symptoms until years after they are born. In most cases, symptoms will rapidly arise when natural ‘cleaning up’(so called pruning) processes start in early adulthood start. To simplify, the earlier misconnected cells are ‘found’ by the pruning process and - eliminated. The more obvious schizophrenia symptoms are the result.
After this onset of obvious symptoms, symptoms could recede for months or even years. But if it is schizophrenia, it will come back, and eventually settle in permanently.",schizophrenia
1101,"Schizophrenia is typically characterized by three main stages: prodromal, acute, and residual. The prodromal stage involves subtle changes in behavior, such as social withdrawal. The acute stage is marked by the onset of positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. Finally, the residual stage may follow acute episodes, with diminished symptoms but lingering impairments in daily functioning. It's important to note that the course of schizophrenia can vary among individuals. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms, seeking professional help is crucial.",schizophrenia
1102,"I can only answer this from the point of view of a mother of a son who has schizophrenia. I first noticed a deep, dark depression, worse than any depression he’d ever had. He withdrew from everything and everyone, wouldn’t answer phone, texts or emails. Then he lost his girlfriend and job. His girlfriend told me she thought maybe he was manic or something. He routinely posted gibberish on facebook, phrases that didn’t make any sense and often with made-up words. Next, his roommates kicked him out because he couldn’t pay his rent. I brought him home and that’s when he went completely psychotic. He told me his thoughts got blocked, that he was hearing voices and his behavior had just become totally erratic. He would get lost when he left the house. He became unable to function in the real world. He agreed to go to the ER and he’s been in therapy/on meds ever since. He exhibited most, if not all of the classic symptoms of the disorder.",schizophrenia
1103,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
1104,"I have been living with schizophrenia for some time and know very well that being prepared may help, but professional help is the best way.
The first two years, I had following symptoms:
Panic attacks
Disturbed sleep
Sleeping during the day and staying awake during the night
Mood swings
Hearing voices inside my head
Heightened sense of morality
No interest in cleanliness
Thinking i'm more important than I was
Withdrawn and moody at the workplace - tendency to vanish in the background and under performance
No interest in socializing
Being diagnosed with the disease helped me immensely, at least I knew what was wrong with me. I was glad that my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. In the long run, I have dissociated from psychiatric treatment and embraced symptomatic control techniques like meditation and deep breathing.",schizophrenia
1105,"Schizophrenia is part of a larger group of mental health disorders known as Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.
So, yes. There is a spectrum of disorders with varying symptoms. I’ll discuss some here. There are two ways in which severity is outlined — based on duration and based on symptom severity.
Duration
<1 month. Brief Psychotic Disorder has similar symptoms to Schizophrenia but lasts less than a month.
1-6 months. Schizophreniform Disorder is similar to Schizophrenia but is less severe in that it lasts at least a month but less than 6 months.
Severity
If a person has the qualifying symptoms for at least 6 months, they will be diagnosed with full-on Schizophrenia but, even within this diagnosis, there are severity ratings based on a quantitative assessment of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior and negative symptoms. Each is rated on a 5 point scale and combined as specified in the DSM-5 to determine severity.",schizophrenia
1106,"For the majority of people , subacute symptoms or prodromal symptoms start around the age of 15 or 16. You may start having less motivation or less initiative than you had previously, for instance you may not feel like playing basketball anymore or singing in the girls choir and you don't really know why, you may have interrupted sleep or start to sleep more than usual and your appetite may change. You may start having thoughts that seem odd or bizarre, that you don't dare tell anyone, or you may start coming up with some really wild ideas, for instance you may start thinking more about religion , space, infinity etc. You begin to notice that you hear everything at the same decibel, like people's voices, the fan, the clock ticking so its helpful if you spend more time away from people so it won’t be so loud. You may see flashes or lines out of the corner of your eye. You may hear your name being called but when you turn there is no one there. Sometimes people can get scared that other people are talking about them in a negative way, or watching them or putting things in their food . During this time you know your thinking might be off but you can't figure out why you are thinking this way- in other words you still have insight . Without getting help at this early stage your insight slowly disappears and you start believing your thoughts more and more over time. At some point if you go without treatment you are unable to tell what's real and what's not real.
That's how schizophrenia develops.",schizophrenia
1107,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
1108,"It doesn't cause schizophrenia, but it certainly can get so out of control that it causes symptoms of psychosis, or at least that look like psychosis. Good psychiatrists know the diffetence between severe OCD and psychotic disorders, but many psychistrists just assume a psychotic disorder and don't even consider OCD when it seems psychotic. OCD is different from psychosis though, because with OCD the person knows that their “ delusional” thoughts, obsessions and behaviours don't really make sense, but nonetheless they feel helpless do do anything about it. When a person is truly psychotic( and sometines people with OCD are also psychotic, you can have both), they don't even consider that their thoughts and behaviours don't make sense, they are pretty sure that they do.
I know when I look and sound totally psychotic to others, why that is, but my OCD sometimes makes it impossible to convince anyone otherwise and then I start to wonder if I really am psychotic and my OCD doesnt get addressed/ treated and I just become psychotic and then I'm in a psych ward being treated for unspecified psychosis or schizophrenia until and if a doctor finally considers the possibility that I have extreme OCD.",schizophrenia

As far as I know, OCD will not make you insane.
It can make you think you are crazy, or make you wish you were insane, but that is not the case.
It is a mental health issue that some people are able to deal with and possibly over come better than other people.
I believe there are varying degrees of OCD, and this influences the outcome of treatment and therapy.
Mental health issues are a real bitch, because they differ from one person to the next. What one person can and does do won’t always work for someone else, or someone else many not be capable of the same determination and drive to get better. This isn’t a short comming on their part, it is just a statement of fact.

1110,"Yes, but OCD typically doesn’t cause schizophrenia, although the two can go together.
Picture this scenario,
A person with OCD has obsessions and continues to think they left the stove on. They make dinner and afterward, they head to bed. Then, it just hits them. A random moment of terror “Oh god! I just left the stove on!” They shoot out of bed and run to the kitchen in a panic to look at the stove. They head back to bed, but then, with their obsessive behavior, start doubting their own reality. They actually can’t even trust their own eyes. The panic sets in again and for the second time, they run into the kitchen and check on the stove AGAIN despite them already checking it was off 10 minutes ago.
This is a form of temporary psychosis in the sense that the person suffers from delusions and disorganized behavior. They doubt their own reality and causes them to go berserk with sheer anxiety.

1115,"Clearly, some patients do have both OCD and psychosis and this is well documented. However, before jumping to the conclusion that this may be the case, be mindful that severe OCD patients can appear to the observer to be exhibiting psychotic behavior , which is actually OCD, for example muttering to one’s self while ritualistically counting, is not psychosis. The person knows the difference between reality and inner thoughts, but the obsessions are so strong that they fell compelled to continue to the behavior, even though it is unwanted, ego-dystonic and the patient is often aware that the behavior, checking, obsessing, counting and so forth is not helpful and probably not really necessary. Yet the y feel compelled to do it. Many of my patients liken OCD thoughts to a sort of mental form of tics - an unwelcome , intrusive thought or fear enters consciousness, and despite a logical understanding that the intrusive thought may not be true, it becomes an obsession and patients are unable to stop the negative feedback loop. An example would be a vOn ry well educated , socially deft, charming young woman who would have intrusive thoughts that she was a minion of the devil. Logically, this Ivy League grad knew this was not true, but the thoughts were intrusive, persistent and became obsessions and she resorted to magical thinking and compulsions to try and control them. Contrast this to the psychosis of schizophrenia, where there is a breakdown of the ability to distinguish internal stimuli, such as hallucinations, from the real world. Very different underlying etiology but may present with similar behavior- distracted, internally preoccupied.
If untreated, severe OCD could cause psychosis through prolonged exposure to anxiety, sleep loss, isolation and other mechanisms, but I have found this surprisingly uncommon . Fortunately , this is mostly an academic question, since a rational approach to treatment usually starts with medications such as SSRI’s and CBT with the addition of low dose atypical antipsychotics such as Abilify as a next step- this will help with the “tic-like ‘ nature of the intrusive thoughts but will also treat psychosis.",schizophrenia

1117,"As you know by now the dangers of schizophrenia, now we are gonna talk about its effects. It can cause many other disorders along with Paranoid schizophrenia Symptoms:
Anxiety Disorders
Depression
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Anxiety causes stressful acts, unknown pains, breathing fast, sweating a lot, shaking, imperfect heartbeat, and many more.
Depression can make a person antisocial, have no interest in life or ambitions, sad, deeply distrustful, and more.
OCD can be impairing and weakening, World Health Organization (WHO) has ranked Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as the most impairing disease in the world. OCD is in the top 10 impairing disorders. OCD causes a person to develop depression and anxiety making them fall for drug abuse.
A person’s health can get worse if suffering from two combined diseases. For example, schizophrenia makes a person think that an unseen force is keeping an eye on him and is trying to harm him. And if OCD is developed along with it, it makes him believe that he must do some things to get rid of the unseen force, leading him to things like black magic or voodoo.",schizophrenia
1118,"No, schizophrenia is a separate condition to OCD, but not exclusive as I have known a person with both conditions who was also psychopathic.
Having OCD appears to mean a person may have an increased risk of schizophrenia, but there are other genetic and environmental factors which would need to be isolated first. A psychiatric study into the links between OCD and scizophrenia explores this in much greater detail: OCD as Risk Factor for Schizophrenia.
I would strongly encourage anyone with OCD to seek professional help. They do not have to accept any treatment offered if they so wish, although I would encourage them to do so; but it is important it is at least assessed. There are numerous support groups for people with OCD and I would recommend investigating them, peer-to-peer based ones are particularly useful, in my opinion.

It is possible to have both OCD and a psychotic diagnosis and for someone with a psychotic diagnosis to have OCD symptoms but not meet full criteria for OCD.

1126,"I’m diagnosed with both and for me the biggest difference is the complexity.
My OCD is very straight forward, almost mathematical. An obsessive thought leads to a compulsion. I get a very strong feeling to do it and give in. I basically have to do a lot of random things based on random obsessive thoughts. If I make a mistake I have to do it all over again. OCD is very time consuming and annoying.
Examples of obsessive thoughts:
-Wash hands 3 times for 30 seconds.
-tap door 30 times, then close it every 3 seconds 10 times (If it feels ‘wrong’ I have to start over again)
My schizophrenia is a lot more complicated. I will focus on auditory hallucinations here for the sake of comparison but that’s just a very small part of schizophrenia. When I hear a voice, it’s different than a thought, I hear if it’s male or female and I even recognise who it is. (I gave the different sounding voices in my head names)
Voices, like obsessive thoughts, are usually very demanding but voices personally attack me and are destructive. They don’t always tell me what to do but if they do they go into much more depth and usually it’s bad things instead of random things. They call me names, try to convince me into believing conspiracies, try to convince me into harming myself and others etc. Another big difference is that I often have different voices at the same time, telling me to do (opposite) things whereas it’s always one obsessive thought at a time.
Examples of voices:
-kill yourself ugly b*tch, slit your throat stupid wh*re, you are worthless!
-That’s not your mother *inaudible whispering* kill her, kill her! She’s an imposter, she’s not real, can’t you see? She wants to harm you!

It is obsessions. It is thinking a thought or thoughts repetitively. Let's say my obsession is that I have cancer. I would almost constantly think things like,

I am 99% sure I have three months to live. Oh my gosh! I don't have a will!!! Wait, I'm sixteen. I don't own anything…I don't need a will. Buuut I am still dying of cancer. I should probably have the mole on my arm checked out, it looks like cancer.

How much time is going to pass until you realize a coffin was formed around you. Maybe psychiatry is the carpenter of that coffin? Or maybe it’s genuinely trying to keep you alive. But it is an industry just like any other industry, and it stands to gain a LOT by your weakness and flawed nature, it wants to label you and you want to be labeled on some level. Deeply consider the benevolence of any complex organism or the intention for the tools they create and where those tools become directed.

1130,"Yes, it is. It is named schizoaffective disorder. The symptoms are the same as in schizophrenia plus affective disorder.

The symptoms and the treatment are the same. It is only a theoretical debate withought practical consequences.

1131,"Having the read the previous answers and finding they were completely unhelpful, I thought I’d jump in with my own unique perspective.
You need to understand the difference between what are referred to as Axis I and Axis II disorders. Axis I is considered a class called state, and Axis II are thought of as trait. Axis I are the major mental illness diagnoses: bipolar, depression, schizophrenia, real serious life long stuff. The big time name up in lights illnesses. The good news is that medicine [and big pharma] are always looking for new and better ways to alleviate the symptoms of these “Axis I major mental illnesses. “ Please note: symptoms not cure.
Axis II are personality disorders. They are not considered to have the same biochemical basis as the Axis I disorders, although God knows I question that, given no one knows what chemicals because no one can administer a chemical test for it; they can only give you chemicals and see if they work for you, hit and miss and try something else until they work.
Axis II personality disorders are just that: you are being told that you have a sick personality. That’s just what every patient wants to hear. Among them is narcissist personality disorder; antisocial personality disorder; histrionic personality disorder; dependent personality disorder; and a favorite diagnosis of young women who are a monstrous pain in the ass and resistant to treatment, borderline personality disorder. If you have them all you’re the president.
The symptoms of some personality diagnoses, like obsessive compulsive disorder, can be reduced with medications like Prozac or Zoloft, as is the case with certain anxiety disorders. But that’s because these drugs are designed to make the user more chill, and are prescribed to a wide variety of patients many of whom have neither an Axis I or Axis II disorder: they are just having a hard time with life in general.
But there is nothing that comes out of test tube that can make one less of a narcissist, any more than there is a medication to make someone more empathetic. No drug can make you less clingy, less dependent, less antisocial.
Notice I haven’t even addressed the main question, which is basically what is schizotypal personality disorder. And here we go again with the very, very subjective symptoms: stop me if you have even one of these.
Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior but is inconsistent with sub cultural norms. Does that include all this crystal stuff? What about betting at the track based on nothing more than being on a streak?
Suspicious or paranoid idealizations. Like Facebook and Target and the Social Security administration gave out enough of your personal information that false clones of you will be taking out credit cards for decades?
Constricted affect. You want to know how I feel? Fuck you.
Blunted affect. You want to know how I feel? Who knows?
If you want to be diagnosed with both a mental illness and a personality disorder get the mental illness first, and then be completely non-compliant with treatment and give everyone around you an unmerciful amount of shit, particularly the treatment professionals and close family members, and trust me, they are going to think your personality sucks, too. Eventually you will end up in a locked psych unit, in jail, or a psych unit in jail, the absolute worst.
The trick is to remain chill. No one cares what you think. Everyone cares how you act. If you act out, as in out of control, in no time someone will take control of you. Act chill. Act chill and you’ll feel chill. Feelings follows actions as often as actions follow feelings, and you can wedge thoughts in between both. Act chill, feel chill, think chill. That will get you through any number of professionals and family members telling you what your damage is. Check out DBT and CBT. Look ’em up. They’ll teach you how to get a grip before you lose your grip.

1132,"Thank you for the question. I’m JIM and I’m 70 years old and I’m a retired Structural Engineer and General Contractor. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1972.

Yes, it's possible for someone to be diagnosed with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which is sometimes called schizoaffective disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is a rare mental health condition that occurs when a person experiences symptoms of both schizophrenia and a mood disorder, such as depression or mania. Symptoms typically emerge in late teens to early adulthood. I was in the hospital last year for four weeks and in rehab for six weeks. While in the hospital, I begin to experience both visual and auditory hallucinations. The doctors and nurses said that they would pass. They haven’t. It’s been over a year. So now I am with schizoaffective bipolar disorder. Say that three times fast. Lol.
Experts don't always agree on how to diagnose overlapping bipolar and schizophrenia, so they may be diagnosed separately or as schizoaffective disorder. Treatment for schizoaffective disorder usually involves a combination of medication and therapy, such as psychotherapy and skills training. Other treatments may include hospital stays or electroconvulsive therapy.
Studies suggest that early treatment is linked to a better prognosis and functioning. Working closely with your doctor can help you manage your condition, and you can also try to establish a routine to help prevent depression and mania from taking control. For example, you could commit to being in bed only eight hours a night and up and moving the rest of the time.
I am now on 300 mg of LITHIUM daily and 7.5 mg of Olanzapine. I take 1 mg of Clonazepam at nite as needed for sleep. Good luck to you or whoever you are caring for.

1133,"Ok, everyone has their own opinion so others will disagree with me. That's fine.
But I would say no. The reason being that symptoms overlap the disorders.. The negative symptomology involved in Schizophrenia like hallucinations, and delusions can happen with bipolar disorder, too. So hallucinations, usually auditory, often voices, happen with both disorders. Ditto delusions and other altered perceptions of reality.
And the depressed phase of bipolar disorder so common with bipolar in the old days does not happen with every bipolar case.
And the overlapping symptoms back in the day made for diagnostic headaches and missed diagnosis was not unusual. But some were diagnosed as bipolar with hallucinations, delusions etc.
There was also the developing idea that bipolar and depression was a matter of scale for lack of a better word at the moment .
That leads to some current diagnostic categories of “bipolar, depressed, bipolar manic, and bipolar mixed (both manic and depressed alternating, maybe by hx).
Which comes back to bipolar with hallucinations. If someone meets that bipolar symptom complex and has hallucinations as well, then :Bipolar with hallucinations.",schizophrenia
1134,"In the UK, doctors usually treat you by symptoms rather than which disorder is worse. If you're presenting as manic and psychotic then they treat the mania and psychosis with antipsychotics/mood stabilisers first to alleviate the immediate problems which are causing distress to her person.
Then, doctors will treat other aspects of the illnesses once the patient is more stable or if their condition changes. Maybe, they slip into a depression and then they will treat the depression as it is the new most distressing symptom.
Other overarching treatments are given. the patient might need longer term psychotherapy or group sessions.",schizophrenia
1135,"There is a diagnosis that combines the two. Schizoaffective Disorder is Schizophrenia combined with Depression or Bipolar symptoms. Sometimes doctors prefer to give separate diagnoses for each. I once asked a psychiatrist what the difference was with Schizoaffective Disorder and having Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder at the same time. Her answer was “I don't know.” The only reason to diagnose both (that I can think of) is if the clinician wants to have a more specific description like “Bipolar Disorder most recent episode Manic, and Paranoid Schizophrenia.” I worked in mental health for 25 years and I have seen doctors diagnose both conditions in the same person. Mental health diagnoses aren't clearly defined in the same way as physical disorders. If someone meets the criteria for a diagnosis, they get the diagnosis, that's it.",schizophrenia
1136,"Yes they can, and there's also schizoaffective disorder. If you think you specifically might have both, I think you need a “professional” opinion (which I am wary of, as I've been diagnosed with everything under the sun & doubt I'm some anomaly that actually has all the diagnoses). (I do have something, however, and believe my two current diagnoses are finally correct.)
That being said, a college teacher explained it well when she said one mental disorder can predispose/lead you to another. (Imo, not with bipolar & schizophrenia so much… They seem rather “inherent” to me, but that's my unjustifiable opinion!)

1137,"It is called bipolar with schizoaffective tendencies. I am such a person as I did have all the symptoms of someone with bipolar 1 and as I did also communicate with an internal voice, no one else could hear. You can read all the details in my story underneath my profile.",schizophrenia
1138,"We really don’t know. Bipolar and schizophrenia are diagnosed by observation of the symptoms, not by a test. There are similarities, in that both involve a detachment from reality and bizarrre behaviours. However bipolar is more a disorder of mood - the patient is full of unrealistic plans and bursting with energy, or alternatively down in the dumps and completely unmotivated, whilst schizophrenia is more a disorder of thought - the patient is convinced of ideas which are unlikely and don’t make sense. Bipolar comes and goes whilst schizophrenia is constant.
The modern trend is to say that if a patient is ambiguous between bipolar and schizophrenia, then they have “schizoaffective disorder”. But whether we are looking at two underlying disorders, or three underlying disorders, or whether all these illnesses are really just slightly different manifestations of the same underlying problem, we don’t know.",schizophrenia
1139,"From experience, in a extreme manic or depressed state, someone can become psychotic, just like a schizophrenic having a delusional state. So it's possible for the issue being confused as for what diagnostic assessment is applied without some previous history and interactions.
Like wise, from a condition of being brought up in a abusive family relationship, someone who has a cycle of becoming detached and in a near psychotic state because of the abuse from their very early lives through adulthood, could be a self defense mechanism for minimalizing the effect of the previous abusive punishment.
I have a cycle of depression and anger issues, largely because I couldn't express myself as for why I felt that way. The family reinforced my being abused, and largely because of the culture that I came from where the parent was never questioned about why I needed to be disciplined to the extent that I experienced.
Just a rebellious kid who never learned that being angry and being punished for expressing that anger was appropriate behavior. After all your parents couldn't be mistaken as acting inappropriately. If I didn't learn self control then it was my issue needing correction and nothing that could be a fault of their parents behavior.
Adopting escapism behavior mentally, developing a fantasy alternative world to escape to because it's the one area that they couldn't interfere with and punish as inappropriate behavior becomes a natural state during the stressful periods. Becomes a normal if not natural answer to deal with those situations that I didn't have any control over otherwise. You would be surprised what defensive actions that help avoid reality can be adopted as a survival behavior. It's the perception that this is schizophrenia is a natural assumption.",schizophrenia
1140,"Yes. That is called schizoaffective disorder. It means you have schizophrenia, with rhe additional mood swings of bipolar disorder. In my case, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia first. Hallucinations, voices, psychosis, etc etc. Then it became apparent to the therapist over a period of months that I had additional severe month long mood swings. Aka, schizoaffective disorder.
Thanks for asking this question.",schizophrenia
1141,"Yes, but not commonly.
The combination is sometimes referred to as ‘schizoaffective disorder’. But this has really become more of a catch-all diagnostic bucket in recent years, and effectively meaningless in clinical practice.
But there are indeed a (rare) few who struggle with chronic schizophrenia complicated by intermittent episodes of mania. The diagnoses are determined by applying the criteria for both. This is best done by clinicians who are familiar with the patients. A schizophrenic may suffer from chronic paranoia and command auditory hallucinations. But if he suddenly finds himself unable to sleep at all, full of energy, talking a mile a minute, hyper-sexualized, and now kicked out of his shelter for otherwise uncharacteristically off behaviors, there may be a co-occurring bipolar disorder. And although the manic symptoms may be more dramatic at the moment, the baseline psychotic symptoms should still remain.
I wouldn’t waste time otherwise trying to tease out ‘schizoaffective disorder’. The criteria for schizoaffective disorder diagnoses are appropriately nonsensical, and hence its status as a wastebasket diagnosis.
Certainly there may be other confounders, notably drug use and the possibility then of either a substance-induced mood or psychotic disorder. Depression, too, can present with psychotic symptoms, as can severe anxiety, OCD, and trauma-related disorders.
Luckily, the same medications are used to treat all of these disorders, so when in doubt…",schizophrenia
1142,"I'm schizoaffective. In my case, that means I have symptoms of both usually at the same time.
I honestly don't know which is worse. During Mania I'd do drugs, gamble, have sex with anything that would lay down with me, waste tons of money, or go into fits of rage, hurt others for no reason or perceived slight, get into fights (and so on it goes) I've started so many projects while riding a manic high. (For me it feels really really great during a mania. Better than drugs. Better than sex. ) and I have major depression.
On the schizophrenia side I have a flat affect except during mania, minor audio hallucinations, occasional delusions (these bother me more than anything else), vocalized poverty of speech (I write leagues better than I talk), paranoia semi frequently, anhedonia, listlessness, and being extremely slow (doing anything and everything) listlessness and frequent insomnia.
All of these symptoms would manifest in no particular order at no particular grouping (the bipolar is cyclic). I take drugs for my mania, depression, and I take antipsychotics for the schizophrenia. So I don't go into a mania any more though I can physically feel when my body would be going into a manic episode (for me it's kinda like that feeling before orgasm except now it just stops there for a few days).
As I understand it, having both means it's not as extreme as having one or the other. It really depends on the severity. I rarely hallucinate visually for example. Ultimately, I couldn't guess which is worse
If you made it down here; thank you for reading.",schizophrenia
1143,"Certainly this is possible- with the understanding that diagnoses can often times be false, or just one disorder representing another via very similar symptoms. I was diagnosed with bi-polar, when in reality I have panic disorder and ADHD (and fits of depression) - this combo can mimic mania and depressive episodes. However, upon further evaluation, I do not have bi-polar.
On the contrary it is also possible to have both disorders, and be diagnosed as such.",schizophrenia
1144,"Not in the DSM-5-TR.
Because mania and hypomania cannot be differentiated from each when schizophrenia is present, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is given instead. When mania or hypomania occurs outside of an acute psychotic state in an individual with schizophrenia other specified bipolar disorder is given as the diagnosis for mania, and other specified depressive disorder is given as the diagnosis during depression.
I think they should take out the criterion that prevents a psychotic disorder and a bipolar or depressive disorder from being diagnosed simultaneously, and give both diagnoses based on the symptoms outside of acute psychosis, but that’s not currently the way of the DSM-5-TR.",schizophrenia
1145,"It's possible to be diagnosed with anything, accurate or not, depending on what symptoms one is experiencing at the time of diagnosis and the skill of the diagnostician.
However, one could not be accurately diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, because there is another diagnosis that includes the symptoms of both. I'll get to that in a minute.
First, let me explain that it is possible to have psychotic symptoms - e.g., hallucinations, delusions, disorganized/incoherent thought processes and speech - during a depressive episode and/or during a manic episode. If the psychotic symptoms take place only during a manic or depressive episode, the accurate diagnosis would be either Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I Disorder, the difference being whether the person has ever experienced a manic episode. The diagnostician would add a specifier to indicate the presence of psychotic features (example: Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic with mood-congruent psychotic features).
If the person in question has had or is having a manic or depressive episode with psychotic features, and the person has had significant psychotic symptoms, as described above, during a period of normal mood, then the diagnosis is Schizoaffective Disorder, not both Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.
So, it is possible, probably rather common even, to receive a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder first, based on one or more manic episodes, with or without a history of depressive episodes, and then later, after a period of normal mood with significant psychotic symptoms, to have the diagnosis changed to Schizoaffective Disorder. It is also possible to be first diagnosed with Schizophrenia, based on psychotic symptoms and meeting other criteria for schizophrenia, without a history mania or depression, and then later to present with a depressive or manic episode with psychotic features, and have the diagnosis changed to Schizoaffective Disorder.
If the treatment provider changes in between, a person could conceivably end up with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia diagnoses in their records. If this happens, the provider needs to correct the record, indicating that the diagnosis has changed and the previous diagnosis is historical only. If the client/patient, or someone else such as a clerical person, notices that both bipolar and schizophrenia diagnoses are in the chart, that person should request that the provider correct the record.",schizophrenia
1146,"There is what is called Schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. This is when psychotic symptoms are experienced outside of mood states, but also that there is a mood disorder present . With Schizophrenia, there is not.

1148,"Not so much. Most people with a mixture of affective(mood symptoms, like those seen prominently in bipolar) and schizophrenia symptoms qualify for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.

Basically they are thought of as two separate end points from the same genetic predisposition, they are not on the same trajectory. But they are related so in reality they are on a spectrum so I don't see why you couldn't have bits of both. I think you also have to realize that we are not 100% on any disorder, there are still strong debates about which exist and which don't and which are actually just additional names for the same disorder. So I'm sure there are people diagnosed with both, just like there are people diagnosed with one who actually have a completely different disorder.

And as more is learned about the brain, instead of making breakthroughs regarding this very complex illness, which is wide ranging with no two people suffering with the exact same symptoms of it or in the same way..There is a shift in views today regarding whether the auditory hallucinations and the voices heard in the mind of the sufferers could be something far more complex and as real as those hearing them believe that they are. And not a mental illness or hallucinations.. Possibly a form of ESP or an untapped region of the brain which is tuning into a psychic dimension. But noone knows..
Because despite the anti psychotic dangerous medicine being used to treat it today, with serious side effects and known to cause damage to the vital organs, unfortunately all it achieves is to merely tone down the voices, but never completely eradicates them, just makes them a little easier to live with and manage, but they never disappear completely. And unfortunately when they are untreated, as they mostly are, as unfortunately diagnosis is a long lengthy process often taking years, even decades to get property diagnosed. So these voices are relentless, tormenting and torturing but sadly real to the sufferer, who doesn't actually notice that they are ill and believes they are real, even their own voices or others externally which they are hearing. They never stop with the constant insults, put downs, threats, persecution and provocation. Often sending the sufferer into compete insanity and resulting in them taking their own lives to stop the enslaught before they can take no more and act on these ill informed instructions that are repeated over and over again until they are acknowledged and acted upon. Which brings a brief short term relief before they begin all over again..
It's been established that we don't hold or recall our memories from any part of our physical brain as it simply doesn't have the capacity. Thus it's believed that we are uploading and downloading these things to something that external and like a mainframe, much like we upload and download data to the cloud with technology.
The fact is that noone knows what part of the brain causes paranoid schizophrenia or why it is more prevalent in some and not others. There are some who believe that there is some correlation between taking drugs in early teens before the brain has fully developed, due to there being a higher amount of people who smoke weed regularly in pre adolescent and developing paranoid schizophrenia in later life. Unfortunately though no direct link has been confirmed, so just another theory..",schizophrenia
1153,"The most common mainstream medical treatments for this illness are antipsychotic medications.
They have been around for decades, have been well studied and researched, and are standard, mainstream treatments.
There are no “cures” for this illness. There are effective treatments. It is a complex, complicated illness, and the medications are most useful to quell hallucinations, often can reduce delusions such as paranoia, but less beneficial in working with lack of motivation.

1155,"Here is what is helping me. I am 40-years old diagnosed with paranoid / undifferentiated schizophrenia:
What I’ve figured out is: for those at risk:
You go schizophrenic if you don’t aim to be rational.
You go schizophrenic if you drink alcohol.
You go schizophrenic if you are uncomfortable.
You go schizophrenic if you over-eat.
You go schizophrenic if you don’t eat a large meal every 3 days.
NEW SUGGESTIONS:
Focus on rational activity.
Don’t drink alcohol.
Try to live comfortably.
Don’t over-eat.
Eat a large meal at least every several days.
Technological solution to schizophrenia: The gods set the volume too high.

1156,"No, there isn’t.
It is a lifelong brain disease.
However, niacin and vitamin C (3000–18000 mg a day) can help but ask a doctor first.
Don’t mix alcohol with niacin.
There is also a test to show if you can even metabolize Folate which could lead to you getting a script for the Methylated version.
Fish oil in doses of up to 10000 mg can help with some symptoms also.
Above all taking an antipsychotic is best and lithium can help too.
Being as to how Schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative brain disease it would be wise to add lithium as it stimulates the dentate gyrus which leads to more neurons and a thicker Cerebral Cortex.",schizophrenia
1157,"If the diagnosis is confirmed then the mainstay of treatment is a balanced and judicious use of antipsychotics. Other add-ons may be required based on any comorbid symptom like depression, anxiety, insomnia, dementia etc.
After the psychosis has been tackled by antipsychotics or combination of medications, then the next step is rehabilitation. There are many different views about what specifically should be done. But in my view, a very tailored approach is required. Psychoeducation about the condition, medications, prognosis etc should be universally given. I suggest that social skills training should be given to everyone, especially in a country like India where Schizophrenia is a big stigma still. Then depending on the need, cognitive rehabilitation, cognitive therapy, behavioral techniques, family counselling, psychosocial interventions etc should be given.
A very difficult group of patients is constituted by treatment refractory schizophrenia. However, such patients are very rare. The treatment of such patients is out of the scope of present answer. Hope that helps. Cheers!",schizophrenia

1159,"Thanks for the A2A. I apologize for the delay in responding.
What makes it really challenging to deal with paranoid schizophrenia is the fact that it exaggerates normal and logical reasoning to a proportion that's crippling and dysfunctional. Unfortunately drugs don't help much in this regard. However understanding, acceptance and a resolve to observe while disengaged with paranoid thoughts might qualitatively reduce the amount of distress experienced.
By acknowledging that your paranoid state is exaggerated version of regular fears, you are already ahead. Considering this analogy might help. Imagine that you are traveling in a bus. This journey is very important to you and has to be made, even if at great price. It's an overnight trip and your co-passenger is extremely annoying, mean even. Despite trying your failure to shut this person up, you have to continue the journey. You would rather discontinue the journey if given a choice, but you can't because this journey is too important to you. Letting this annoying person ruin that is not what you want to do. So what do you do? Muster patience and start ignoring the provoking shoved your way. Now consider this bus as your mind, this journey as life's time-line, the annoying co-passenger as your paranoid thoughts and yourself as that awareness in you that knows what's right thing to do and what is going on. You don't have to beat or defeat the co-passenger (paranoid thoughts), you have to step back and ignore. With practice you will get better at ignoring. Seek therapy to help yourself learn better ignoring or dealing techniques. When you stop engaging your paranoid thoughts, keep them on standby by being indifferent to them, they will eventually lose significance. Fighting them will acknowledge them further in your head, give them the negative attention that will cause them to persist. Remember, what we resist, persists, as C. G Jung famously quoted.
Hope this helps!",schizophrenia
1160,"I carried that medical label, so speak from experience.
The label is subjective, having no scientific basis. People have life experiences that need be be heard. One to a few words of a label does no justice to describe one’s life experience.
In one hospital, a doctor told me I needed to take anti-psychotic medication for the rest of my life, or I would have relapses of paranoia and hearing voices. He told me it was the same as a diabetic needing insulin. He was wrong. By the way, the old name for anti-psychotics was tranquilizers. The latter actually describe the real action of the drug.
During my eighth mental hospitalization, I realized those who worked there were making a living from my distorted reality. Why would they want to eliminate it? I then made a rock-solid intention to do whatever it might take to never return, and became non-compliant. This meant not taking their drugs, attending outreach, or living in neighborhoods with other ex-patients.
What helped the most was finding an excellent private psychotherapist, not one from the state hospital system. She was highly skilled, and after a year of weekly therapy sessions with her, I never heard voices again and never went into a hospital or took meds.",schizophrenia

It is important to work closely with a mental health professional to create a personalized treatment plan. Some strategies that may help with delusions and schizophrenia include:
1. Medication: Antipsychotic medication is often prescribed to help manage symptoms of delusions and schizophrenia. These medications can help reduce hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms.
2. Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help individuals challenge and change their thoughts and beliefs about their delusions. This therapy can also help individuals learn coping skills to manage their symptoms.
3. Supportive therapy: This type of therapy focuses on developing a supportive relationship with a therapist who can offer guidance and understanding.
4. Education: Learning more about schizophrenia and delusions can help individuals understand their symptoms and how to manage them.
5. Support groups: Connecting with others who have similar experiences can provide a sense of community and support.
6. Self-care: Taking care of oneself through exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can help improve overall well-being and reduce symptoms.
It is important to note that there is no one ""cure"" for schizophrenia or delusions. However, with proper treatment and support, individuals can learn to manage their symptoms and lead fulfilling lives.

1169,"Psychiatric medicine never cures schizophrenia. Psychiatrists think it is a permanent condition and do their best to make it so. In the 1950s, before psych drugs existed, two Canadian psychiatrists named Dr Hoffer and Osmond, discovered how to actually cure schizophrenia, with large doses of Niacin (vitamin B3) and vitamin C. Even without any treatment at all, 1/3 recovered spontaneously and never had another episode. Another third recovered but had occasional recurrences. Another third did not recover on their own but could be controlled with Niacin and vitamin C. This was the beginning of orthomolecular psychiatry. I practiced orthomolecular psychiatry for 30 years - treating mental illness with nutrition, after testing for nutritional deficiencies and toxicities. At the Princeton Bio center, we got thousands of people off of psych drugs, or prevented them from starting in the first place.

1170,"I never got help but I definitely screamed in my mind for years.. day after day begging for it. All while maybe an hour after that I was just pretending to be cartoons or voices that kept me from just not having anything to think about. Before the auditory hallucinations it was crazy. I had no idea that world even existed before I “heard” it. I went for a couple years where I felt this sense that someone was watching or that something important was going on in my head. There's this sense of begining and endings with it all. I was constantly looking for that journey in my mind with all the conversations and voices and visual hallucinations to end. I was always one day farther than yesterday. One more belief I have left to dissect.. one more delusion that was based on tons of facts that is blended with the conversations and thoughts; to play through and argue my point against myself. It becomes more important than mental health sometimes. It's the story of your own mind and what you remember, how you feel about your life. Now I'm just over anything that isn't obvious and has an answer that is proven true and isn't a guess or anything. I don't chat with myself anymore but I still hear voices. I know that it's just an uncontrollable thing that if I just ignore it, it doesn't effect me anymore. Getting here was hard. “Here” is right where Ieft off before it began but with a static sound constantly and the auditory voices part but I don't chat with it or listen for it anymore. It's just there and so am I. Rebuilding my personality and confidence. It's hard but I'm slowly working back towards being comfortable being the new but old me. It feels like I can't be bothered by anything at all. People being up aliens and government. I choose common sense and not conspiritory thinking. I just say I don't have a view and I mean it.

1171,"Hello,
Paranoia is a form of the spectrum of schizophrenia, which has been called the most debilitating severe mental illness by US National Institute of Mental Health and US National Academies. The World Health Organization has listed schizophrenia as one of ten worse diseases known to mankind. Schizophrenia has been also called the ‘cancer of mental illnesses.’[10]
Schizophrenia causes positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, pressured speech, disorganized thought, etc.); negative symptoms (avolition, anhedonia, asocial, etc.); and cognitive symptoms (reduced working memory, reduced executive functioning, dysfunctional episodic memory, concrete thinking, reduced abstract thinking, reduced processing, reduced IQ, etc.). I have provided some other sufferers experiences[4;7;16-17], and a video of CNN’s Anderson Cooper simulated experience[5] but remember that he “knows” the voices are fake, he is not suffering from negative symptoms, other positive symptoms, and no permanent cognitive symptoms—still he is significantly affected. As an example, he became depressed and wanted to talk to his voices, which I personally do myself all day.
The positive symptoms “add to” the suffer, the negative symptoms “take away” from the suffer, and the cognitive symptoms affect mental functioning.
Psychologically, schizophrenia is considered a heterogenous disorder[11] because each person has different memories from experiences, and the brain uses those experiences against a paranoid schizophrenic.
In some cases, myself included as a person suffering from late-onset schizoaffective disorder[6] (bipolar type)[6;13], which is a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders and Sir Isaac Newton likely suffered from the same[16], a delusion of reference and concrete thinking causes me to believe one bad incident is connected to many, and I become paranoid. For example, a rude person in a grocery store might be wearing a specific solid color, and my mind will then start believing that color is code that is being used by a nefarious criminal network to cause my suicide or threats on my family and friends lives, including children. I project the color onto a car with a certain color, the license plate numbers, if a pattern can be derived like a palindrome, also becomes code. The delusions of reference become a global delusion, and anxiety and paranoia increases drastically.
Although I have two STEM degrees: chemical engineering and biological sciences and I had significant success academically and professionally, I cannot work any longer because the smallest amount of stress precipitates my symptoms more severely.
Personally, I am considered a “refractory” schizophrenic because medication does not help my positive symptoms[1], and research has estimated that 30% or more of the schizophrenic population have positive symptoms that are not helped by anti-psychotics. Also, anti-psychotics do not help with negative or cognitive symptoms.
As for the “cause” of schizophrenia, dopamine is a “hypothesis” but there are other candidates as well[11].
Sadly and finally, schizophrenics tend to die 15-18 years prior to their peers[15-15a]. Personally, I believe this is due to severe stress[18], poor diet because of avolition; anhedonia; paranoia; other symptoms, and toxicity of medication that can cause many subsequent medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, etc. Also, schizophrenics/schizoaffectives are often stigmatized by psychiatrists, nurses, physicians, et., which leads to poor medical treatment, disease, and eventual reduction in life expectancy in some cases[19].

1173,"I honestly believe paranoid schizophrenia is the same thing as post traumatic stress disorder but no one knows what the stress is that caused this scrambling of the brain.
I base this on my early years from grades 1–6. There was a “newspaper boy” (he was not a boy! ) who walked around with his paper bag slung over his shoulder and a huge German Shepard which he called a police dog. He told me that if I told anyone what he was doing he would call the police on me. I was only 6 years old when it started. I didn't ever revise my thinking as I grew. I just believed him when he said he'd call the police. I connected his police dog with the police. It didn't help either that police would patrol the neighborhood and not even question him but actually stop and start conversations with him and wave at him as they drove by. Yes, he was sexually abusing me, using lewd language, talking a lot about making me suck a certain part of his body. I blocked out a lot of the actual abuse by now, but I still remember the fear, the shaking.
Now you tell me how such a scenario that happened regularly, daily for years would not mess up a kids thinking. Think about it? What would it make the child?
Paranoid. Paranoia that looks like self consciousness, so no one questions it. Until you are older. Then they start calling your self consciousness paranoia.
Trust me, paranoia is a type of post traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is hip these days. It's cool to have this disorder. I don't mean to take this lightly. I'm merely pointing out there is no stigma attached to it. But there is a TON of stigma attached to being paranoid sadly. This makes it a thousand times worse. But essentially these are the same thing. I truly believe that because I experienced it, and for good reason.
I am sure that at the root of paranoia is trauma, maybe repeated subtle trauma or maybe trauma as I described but no one makes the connection.
I don't know if anyone has studied these two disorders together but had I chosen to stay in the psychology field I would have.
Someone mentioned that hallucinations and delusions a paranoid schizophrenic has. I will admit that above I was actually talking about paranoia as a way to perceive the world and nothing else. I believe paranoia as I described it is nothing more than self consciousness and fear.
But they are right, paranoid schizophrenia is more complicated. The first thing to realize is it's just a label for a cluster of independent symptoms. Psychologists don't even know if these symptoms have same cause. But they do find them together enough to put them under a label.
I believe that delusions and hallucinations can also be a result of post traumatic stress disorder. Just be aware as you read this, my conclusions are not based on research but on my own experience and speculation. But all science begins with daring to speculate. And maybe someone had already thought of these things. I haven't read the latest psychology.
I believe delusions could be considered a post traumatic reaction. If someone is being laughed at or hurt, and that person seems to be loved by the whole community, your brain could easily jump to the conclusion that everyone else is perceiving you the same way as that person. You may not make the connection in your conscious mind but your unconscious could be drawing this conclusion. Therefore if you don't know the root of why you think everyone is against you it appears not to have a reason: the definition of a delusion. When really, it's a post traumatic stress reaction and nothing more. This could get extreme like thinking your food is poisoned etc. because you have learned to approach the world through mistrust instead of trust.
I believe hallucinations could also be post traumatic stress reactions. By far the most common hallucinations are hearing voices that comment on your behavior or deride you in some way. It sounds a lot like what many kids have to put up with all through grade school. Eventually, grade school kids stop this behavior and move on or mature. But the person affected by this behavior may still be haunted by it. In the absence of this happening anymore, they still have thoughts that there is something wrong with them. This is reinforced now by voices that take the place of the grade school kids who used to always comment on their behavior and make fun of them. This is just a scenario. It could fit any age. I would like to know if bullying or constant criticism or passive aggressive people were in the lives of those who develop hallucinations.
Another reason for hallucinations could be trauma. When I was a toddler my dad broke into my house and I saw him hold a butcher knife to my mom’s throat. It was scary but did I show my fear? Not at all. Instead it manifest itself in these two ways:
I couldn't go into this room without hearing a voice from the wall telling me they were going to kill my mom. This wall was what separates my mom’s bedroom. My mom’s bedroom was where the threat to her life happened. Coincidence? I don't think so. But I was terrified to go into this room. It was the only place I heard the voice.
I was afraid to be in the kitchen when my mom was using the butcher knife. It brought me a lot of anxiety. A post trauma reaction.
I didn't connect any of these things to the trauma. A mother or maybe not even a psychologist would have known to explore in this direction to figure it out. It's only I that knew later in life when I reflected in my own life.
I honestly don't think flat labels help. It's hard to uncover why people are the way they are but I think there is always a reason even if it is never uncovered. I also think these patterns can be changed with resocialization if they are truly loved and learn to trust the world and themselves.",schizophrenia
1174,"I agree with Cathryn Glenday.
I had a major life stressor just before being diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I was sexually assaulted in broad daylight in a big city at the age of 19.
Over the next couple of weeks I rapidly spiralled down into full blown psychosis.
I did however have an uncle who had a mental illness and a mother who had severe anxiety attacks. My uncle's exact medical history was unclear except that he had a severe nervous breakdown and severe residual anxiety possibly paranoia which ended his career at a young age making him an invalid. A family member stated to me that just recently research had been done that concluded anxiety (panic) attacks and schizophrenia share the same gene.
I would conclude that I was genetically predisposed to the possibility of having schizophrenia.
The stressor probably gave it the impetus to manifest.
I am able to live a quiet unassuming life mostly- with medication, therapy, family and community support. Every few years I will have a full blown psychotic episode. These can be directly linked again to major stressors. However stress to me may mean something quite different to the ""average"" mentally healthy person. I do not handle a break in my routine or worry or actual life events or problems well. A major life event would absolutely send me over the edge. At these times I have been hospitalised without my consent being needed for about 2 weeks.",schizophrenia
1175,"I think there are some distinctions to be made as symptoms of one problems can be confused with those of another, resulting in misdiagnosis. It is also true that there is a lot we do not understand about the brain, its illnesses, and the impact of trauma.
That said, not all psychosis is due to schizophrenia. Schizophrenia follows a certain pattern in most cases where there is a serious decline in functioning and the onset of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. Its onset is most often in early adulthood, often late adolescence for males, and young adulthood for females. It tends to be a chronic illness, though is sometimes well-managed with medication. Typically there is no significant association with true trauma, but a stressful or traumatic situation can be a trigger for onset in someone who is already vulnerable. A not uncommon story is when a high performing high school student goes off to college and suddenly declines and becomes psychotic and unable to function. There is an intersection between a stress life event and a previously unknown vulnerability to the illness, but not true trauma.
Some people can suffer from a brief psychotic episode that is not schizophrenia and does not develop into it. This can also be confused with someone who has a brief dissociative episode but does not have a lasting dissociative disorder. The cause of these events are not always known but physical or emotional stress can be a contributing factor.
“Hearing voices” is not always a sign of schizophrenia or psychosis, though it is a symptom that may lead to misdiagnosis. People with dissociative disorders, such as Dissociative Identity Disorder, often “hear voices” and for this reason it is extremely important that a clinician investigate further, as the treatment for psychosis/schizophrenia and DID are very different. DID is always (or almost always) developed out of severe trauma, whereas this clear pattern is usually absent with psychotic disorders. The “voices” experienced in DID are typically alters who may be conversing, arguing, threatening, etc. and often seem to come from inside of the head rather than outside. Some people are able to identify the voices as part of themselves, while others are quite insistent that they are not. The “voices” of schizophrenia are more often felt to come from outside and are often confused with reality, e.g. thinking that a person in the store said something nasty to you when they didn’t. In addition, they generally are accompanied by the other signs of schizophrenia, such a rapid decline in functioning. People with DID are often able to function, sometimes very well, or their functioning may have a lot of variability, depending on the alter who is out.
And, of course, having one disorder doesn’t mean that a person can’t have the other. While I tend to think it is not common, someone who was raised by a mentally ill parent with schizophrenia, for example, may have undergone enough trauma in childhood to have DID and also have a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia.
Sorry if this sounds like an academic lecture. I’m sure there are million exceptions to what I describe and I mean no offense to someone whose experience doesn’t fit what I have learned is “typical”. Most of us aren’t typical. I also recognize that all of the above conditions can be very difficult to manage and I remain sensitive to that.

1176,"The people I know who have made the most progress in recovering from experiences that get labeled as “schizophrenia” or “psychosis” are those who have learned that these behaviors are a result of trauma. While psychiatrists may attribute schizophrenia to brain chemistry dysfunction or genetics, there is no statistically significant evidence demonstrating this, so far.
If you believe that dealing with a traumatic past will help you deal with schizophrenia and psychosis, I would suggest looking for a Hearing Voices Network support group meeting to go to, or attending a Wildflower Alliance facilitator training to learn to be a facilitator of a Hearing Voices ...

1177,"My conclusion, after working in psychiatry hospitals and studying both medicine and psychology, but also practicing shamanism, and going through some really nasty stuff myself, stuff i could never talk about with anyone, even though i talked with fellow doctors on my own, but starting listening to that inner voice that talked different than everything i ever learned, telling me i am not crazy and i only go through it in order to understand what an illness and disorder really is…. is that everything is trauma induced but i will say even more and maybe i will upset someone, but even what we call trauma has a purpose in our soul growth/consciousness growth.
For example, one with a strong, gifted inner nature, living in today’s society with its conditioning and programming, can make one go mad because of what we are teached to judge in ourselves and others and not understanding basic fundaments of human nature, but also natural and universal laws that cannot care less about our beliefs, more that only if something beyond decides, you can have access to experience and information, not to translate it for others because they will not hear you, but your energy to bring awakening just by being present.
But again, even what we call madness it is a natural step in the process.
It is like at one point your soul cannot take it anymore and it brings all the unconsciouss contents on the surface (when you are ready to survive them, so it is done in a natural way) to be seen and integrated.
This is what looks like psychosis, and schizophrenia symptoms show up to one that can see in the dark.
I saw people with schizophrenia that literarlly drew archetypes from the collective unconsciouss and things that came in a future time. I did it also. Those hallucinations are not hallucinations. Everything is real.
My guess is that some of them are the nowadays prophets of our world.
Every amazing gift but also realy deep shadow is hidden in today’s world because of how the system is built. And the system is in our bodies and minds also.
The unconsciouss will never leave you alone untill you live the best life according to who you are and your purpose in the benefit of the whole, and not only you, but every one and every living being.
This way of things naturally unfolding often has nothing to do with labels, defintions and titles in society. Not even words at one point. Zero. You need to drop them all in order to leave your soul do and heal what it already knows how. :)",schizophrenia

omg ok so I don't think Chickie has voiced this trauma much cause there's about 48 hours she doesn't remember inside it.
but we got a call at 3 pm about half hour before we were off work, and we have a personal phone and a work phone, we never answer our personal one during work, but we just for somereason that day picked it up immediately… what proceeded was a conversation with our provincial safety organization telling me they were denying my bullying and harassment claim(without asking for evidence first) there was a I dunno 10 min conversation and then we remember vacuuming.. kinda… and being on a roof… we were at work went up to the roof to grab our tools and suddenly we were standing at the edge thinking we don't need a ladder.
a voice clear as day whisper in our ear just step forward, sooo much easier.
why live and go through this, one step forward and its all over no more stress. and then I come to and my co worker is standing outside on the driveway calling our name… he is seeing us stand at an edge of a roof and not respond to anything…
we come down and again hear the voice clear as day tell us we don't have to go through this… we can drive away and never come back….
we remember seeing 3:19 as we hung up the phone, we remember the vacume, we remember our co worker asking us if were ok cause we just had a conversation apparently by ourselves at the edge of a roof?
then 12 hours later I was in a hospital, 24 hours later in a different hospital and having all our stuff taken from us for safety, 48 hours later we were driving home? 3 days later we were in a giant room talking to a team of well every kind psychiatric doctor, counsellor, there was originally 8 of them but they soon found out as did I men cant be in the room or I freak out..
one traumatic phone call lead to 3 days of my life gone and a suicide attempt..
on another note this is also why we are very scared of cell phones… picking it up could lead to a very unsuspecting outcome… we don't own a cell prob the only one in their 30s in Canada that has a thing about cell phones lol. dings and rings trigger me",schizophrenia
1179,"Traumatic events can trigger other emotions that develop into behaviors that keep people blocked from pursuing their life goals. When this happens, it is time to learn what is going on and make corrections.
As far as “schizophrenia” goes, this is a diagnosis that can be such a triggering event in itself.
Psychiatric diagnoses are subjective, not scientific. Different doctors give different diagnoses to the same person.
Psychiatry is based on what’s called the “medical model.” This means that “mental illness” is a disease caused by chemical imbalances in the brain and/or genetic mutations. This model has never been proven, but provides control and profits to the medical profession.
The typical scenario goes as follows: A person is given a diagnosis and then prescribed a psych drug without information of its addictive and other harmful mental or physical effects. Perhaps they may be hospitalized against their will. Maybe even given electroshock treatments.
All and any of this is very traumatizing. There are viable alternatives to this abuse.",schizophrenia

One son, diagnosed bipolar schizoaffective at age 18, had an abusive alcoholic father and the issues that arise with that, and he accidentally caught our house on fire lighting a Christmas candle at the age of 4, a very traumatic incident. My other son developed symptoms and was diagnosed bi-polar while serving overseas in the armed forces. He doesn’t talk much about the trauma he suffered but was diagnosed with ptsd and traumatic brain injury while in the military.",schizophrenia

Eventually, I had outbursts, heaven forbid, and they blamed my mother for everything including the fact that I couldn’t read. They switched districts and didn’t know they had done an experiment on us with sight-reading instead of grammar and phonetics. My second grade teacher hated my grandma and would take it out on me. Kaela just didn’t get the eraser at the end of the week. Anyway, dad and Sharon abused the living shit out of me. Sharon thought that sleeping with her child made the womb again, and her other son had to have his veins stripped from so much heroin and I was put into the basement with him. Again, being the spoiled brat I am, started to have outbursts. The kids’ parents didn’t like my parents, and they took it out on me. They thought their children, normal children, needed time that I didn’t deserve. Eventually, I stopped going to school and played in the park or got lemon cake. It took them two years to catch me and my friend.

1182,"The realization in recent years is that trauma and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as neglect and abuse contributes much more heavily to schizophrenia than was believed even ten years ago. In fact, it may contribute to the majority of cases.
Schizophrenia has a genetic component that increases one’s vulnerability. It’s unclear if people without any genetic component are more vulnerable after trauma/adverse childhood experiences, partly because not all genetic vulnerabilities have been identified or fully assessed. It appears that hundreds of genes confer some degree of vulnerability, making it likely that virtually all people have at least a little vulnerability.
It’s also clear that some people have high genetic vulnerability, but do not develop schizophrenia.
The interplay between genetics, trauma and ACEs is extraordinarily complex.
Anyone who says the cause of schizophrenia (or any mental illness) is all genetic, or all environmental, is not credible.
What happened to us matters as much, or more, than what’s “wrong” with us.

However, the exact causes of schizophrenia are unknown. Researchers believe that a combination of factors can make a person more likely to develop the condition. These factors include:
Genetics
Brain chemistry
Environment
Stressful life events
Drug and alcohol use
Some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or emotional life event might trigger a psychotic episode. Stressful life events can be traumatic.
I have schizophrenia and have experienced severe trauma as an early age. Although I can’t say my schizophrenia was caused by my early childhood trauma, I firmly believe it made my schizophrenia more severe.
It’s also widely accepted that a psychotic episode can be triggered by experiencing a traumatic event. I also have psychosis, which is common in people with schizophrenia, and some of my psychotic episodes are trauma induced. Whether or not trauma can cause a person to have a psychotic disorder is still open to debate. The correlation is still uncertain.
Here’s what’s known about psychosis:
There is no one cause of psychosis. Psychosis appears to result from a complex combination of genetic risk, differences in brain development, and exposure to stressors or trauma. Psychosis may be a symptom of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or severe depression.",schizophrenia
1184,"It is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question since the exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. There are many factors that may come into play.
Here’s some conditions that are believed to contribute to schizophrenia:
environment - Schizophrenia can run in families
genetics - Stressful life events or trauma, living in poverty, or exposure to viruses or toxins before birth may contribute to the development of schizophrenia.
brain chemistry - Schizophrenia is associated with changes in brain chemistry
brain structure - people with schizophrenia may have abnormal brain structure
substance abuse - Misuse of alcohol or drugs, or suddenly stopping use after a long period of time, can trigger a psychotic episode.
Some people may be prone to schizophrenia, and a stressful or traumatic life event might trigger a psychotic episode. However, schizophrenia is a chronic condition while psychotic episodes are temporary. Medical experts aren’t certain whether traumatic events alone can trigger full blown schizophrenia.",schizophrenia

1186,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.
Image Of The Human Brain - Unsplash.com
After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.
Best wishes to all.",schizophrenia
1187,"Yes.
Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuro means in this case it affects the brain, developmental means it starts before birth.
Schizophrenia is genetic. This means that it originates in gene coding errors that control prenatal brain development. These gene coding errors can be inherited or pop up on their own as mini-mutations. No one does anything wrong to make those mini-mutations happen. They just happen.
There are two main phases of schizophrenia.
The first consists of errors in brain development that occur prior to birth, in very early brain development. Let’s call it the prenatal phase.
The second phase is the one people notice - starting in young adulthood in males, slightly later in females(usually). Let’s call this the symptom onset phase.
Everything the schizophrenic person experiences from the illness is logical considering what the illness does to the brain.
However, we have to keep in mind that there are also social results caused by this illness. Schizophrenics are often isolated, exploited or shunned. Don’t just assume reports of abuse or exploitation are ‘all in his head.’
What happens is this:
The brain goes through a normal, natural ‘pruning’ in early adulthood in order to become more efficient.
Those prenatal brain development errors throw off the pruning process. As a result brain cells are lost in key areas of the brain. For example, brain cell loss in areas of the brain that process auditory signals, results in auditory hallucinations.
Quickly, the brain starts trying to compensate for those brain cells that were eliminated. Within a few weeks, hallucinations, delusions, and other obvious symptoms of schizophrenia will begin.
As a result of the symptom onset phase, there is too much activity on some nerve pathways, and too little on others. Many of the treatment medications for schizophrenia try to reduce the excess activity on the nerve pathways that are getting the worst pounding. Medications have been developed that can act selectively on only those pathways.
Variations:
Schizophrenia symptoms can onset prior to early adulthood. There are other phases of brain development in childhood that can be targeted by this illness.",schizophrenia
1188,"If a person is genetically predisposed to. A psychotic illness any PERCEIVED big stressor can trigger a psychotic episode or bring on the illness so to speak. These stressors can be good stressors like traveling abroad for a month on vacation or a negatively perceived stressor- a trauma, a break up, the stress of school, going into the military etc. You also may be genetically predisposed and live a very quiet stress free life and never have any kind of episode - never knowing if you had the illness or not.",schizophrenia

A person still has to be genetically susceptible to the condition, regardless of the exact presence of the condition.

1193,"Schizophrenia is aggravated by traumatic events, but there it's a requirement for a genetic disposition for the traumatic event to aggravate the condition.

1194,"Psychological trauma or bad parenting does not cause schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder. It has a strong genetic component. The average age of onset for males is in the teens. The average age of onset for females is a bit later in the early 20’s.
What do I mean by a strong genetic component?
The research on monozygotic twins (identical genetics) shows that on average, if one of the twins becomes schizophrenic the other one has a 46% chance of developing it as well—even if they were raised in different homes by different parents.
This is in contrast to the average person’s chance of developing schizophrenia which is estimated to be about 1% worldwide.
Punchline: Do not worry about your trauma experiences leading to you becoming schizophrenic. That is not how people develop schizophrenia. However, if you already have untreated schizophrenia, new stressors can create sooner relapses. If you have any doubts about your mental health, the best thing you can do is get evaluated by a knowledgeable psychiatrist.

1195,"Schizophrenia doesn’t happen all at once. It’s not something that switches on and off.
Instead, people react to trauma over time. Often they forget what happened for years. That could be anywhere from a couple of years to fifty years (or more). They start noticing unusual experiences at any point during this time. They might feel suicidal. They might get depressed. They might hear voices from people who aren’t there. They might see strange signs and omens that others don’t notice. They might see full visions of events no one else sees. There are a gazillion different experiences people might have that indicate a trauma response.
Schizophrenia feels like a sudden thing, because the diagnosis is sudden. One day you see the psychiatrist, and the next you are officially “schizophrenic.” But don’t be fooled. The things that the psychiatrist sees are only the tip of the iceberg and they have been happening for a long time. You might notice them only when they get suddenly big, but many little things have been happening all along that you haven’t really noticed.
Trauma responses happen right away. You might forget what happened right away. You might dissociate. You might start reacting differently in small ways. This stuff grows over time and gets more significant as there are more and more stress in your life. Sometimes, a very stressful event can trigger a much more obvious event. Like a parent dying or graduating from high school or college and needing to support yourself. Or getting fired from a job. There are many stressful events that can precipitate a much more noticeable reaction to trauma from the past.
Many people experience trauma starting when they are babies. Sometimes it starts when you are two years old. Or 4. Or older. Sometimes it is chronic microtraumas. Gaslighting. Sometimes it’s poverty or racism. Sometimes it’s pressure to get all A’s in school. It can happen at any time and in so many different ways they can’t be listed. Often it happens at puberty, when people suddenly start treating you differently due to changes in your body.
There are so many traumas and so many precipitating events or triggers that can escalate your responses to a level where everyone notices that it’s impossible to make a general answer to this question.
The key thing is to observe your own personal experience. This is unique to you. This is your life, which is different from all other people’s lives. Do not try to compare yourself to others. Leave that to psychiatrists. They’re the only ones stupid enough to try to categorize people’s behavior. Focus on yourself and your experience. Focus on making your life better. How you compare to others is irrelevant. Though just about everyone thinks it matters.",schizophrenia
1196,"Everyone talks to themselves, internally and sometimes out loud. These are just your internal thoughts.
A schizophrenic experiences these thoughts differently. They can believe that ‘someone' is telling them to do things by putting thoughts into their heads (example) and won't recognise that these are just their own thoughts.
You know that you are talking to yourself. Perfectly normal.",schizophrenia
1197,"According to the insightful psychology book Scripts People Live by Claude Steiner, most people have an ""injunction"" against talking to themselves, ie they do not, absolutely not, allow themselves to talk to themselves.
However, we all talk to ourselves in our minds, all the time. This is known by many names such as ""mental chatter"" and ""monkey mind"". My favourite term is ""The Eastenders Brain"" (""he said, she said..."") by George Swift (never heard the name? watch this space, he is acquiring legend status here in Berkshire, UK).
So when we have an injunction to not talk to ourselves, yet our minds chatter chatter blah blah blah all the time; this leads to some very interesting consequences and inner conflicts, of which there are too many to mention. (""The human condition"", anyone?)
Eckhart Tolle recounts his experience related to this topic very insightfully in The Power of Now. Basically, he overheard a schizophrenic talking to themselves in the London tube and on the street. Then he realized that he also has a constant conversation going on in his head, the only difference being that he - like most of us - has learned to not voice it aloud.
But make no mistake, it is there. Do let me know if you know of someone who a) does not have the 24/7 monkey mind and b) who has never had to conquer/tame it via meditation and mindfulness.
Back to Claude Steiner and Transactional Analysis. We all have separate ego-states in us, and conversing between these states is actually the key to great insights about oneself, and thus, about the world, as our minds are the only filters we have for whatever else is out there. Steiner considers it healthy to start listening to the voices in one's head, as this is essential in order to gain self-knowledge. If knowledge is power, then self-knowledge is the power of all powers: ""Know thyself"" etc.
In short, talking to oneself is 100% normal, we all do it all the time in our minds, but voicing this chatter (preferably in the privacy of your own home, just to be on the safe side:) can be a very healthy step towards self-knowledge; voicing and listening. Especially when balanced with meditation/mindfulness practices, as per Eckhart Tolle. The chatter is omnipresent before we become aware of it, but the next step is to realize there is more to our minds than the chatter.
Thinking about it, some of the wisest and mentally healthiest people (and most successful, coincidentally) that I know have a habit of talking to themselves, aloud. Without caring that there is someone observing them. It's always worth remembering that what is ""normal"" is average, so perhaps to reach the higher levels of mental health one needs to do stuff that may on the surface appear to be ""quirky"" or ""weird"". Like a really healthy and toned body is ""not normal"" because it's not the norm.",schizophrenia

As for talking to yourself, I would be more concerned if you were hearing other voices or rambling incoherently and stringing unrelated words together. If you do talk to yourself, then that can actually show a higher level of intelligence, and can be beneficial to you in so many ways.
When you talk to yourself, you’re paying attention to someone who often gets short shrift in your life: you. If you berate yourself for behaving idiotically or painfully regret something you’ve done, obviously your self-talk is going to make you feel worse. But if you get a good dialogue going between you and yourself, you can make real headway in clarifying your thoughts and even lifting your mood. I’d go so far as to say the practice is a form of mindful self-compassion. 9 Surprising Benefits of Talking to Yourself
People Who Talk To Themselves Aren't Crazy, They're Actually Geniuses
Before you go worrying yourself over all this, or imagining all sorts of mental health problems, please speak with your doctor. If they believe that a further diagnosis is needed, they will refer you to a psychiatrist who specializes in this area. Until then, stop self diagnosing.

Also I have a (semi) rare case of having tactile hallucinations, a lot of the time it feels like there’s a human there and I can feel them but their not real or I get stabbed a lot.

1210,"I don’t have any symptoms that would be recognized as those typical to schizophrenia, but I do talk to myself. It’s not something I decide or choose to do. I literally can’t stop it happening. It happens when I get manic and at others times when I feel such fear that I have to speak to drown the feeling out from my mind, but it’s also from imagining life situations rather than really experiencing them. There is talking to yourself in the way that normal people do when they are just sort of thinking out loud, and then there is the kind that comes with have mental health problems, like mine.",schizophrenia
1211,"I talk to myself on occasion. The way I understand it, it's really just an externalization of your thought process that normally occurs as interior monolgue. In fact, talking to yourself is actually a trait of intelligence, in no way is it conclusive of having any mental illness. Take my opinion for what it's worth, but I assure you that it is completely normal.",schizophrenia
1212,"Everyone has different symptoms when first developing schizophrenia, so my symptoms might be completely different than someone with the same diagnosis. However, I will still state what happened to me.
For the first time in my life, I was tired. I was 14 years old. Before this, I could wake up for school and stay awake. I wasn’t quite a morning person, but I had no trouble staying awake after getting out of bed. This suddenly changed. I would be in class, and my eyes would start rolling in the back of my head without me even closing my eyes. I’d have microsleeps all day despite getting a full night of sleep. It felt terrible. I was constantly exhausted no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.
My feelings toward my family suddenly changed. I felt that they were against me in some way, I’d constantly argue with them. I was always on edge around them, I was afraid they would hurt me. This fear lead to me hating them for a bit, sadly.
I developed very odd rituals. If I did not throw ice cubes into my pool, I would die. Every time I went onto my back patio, ice had to be thrown into the pool.
I loved being alone during this time. I looked forward to being home alone, but once I was actually home alone, I still felt as though there were people there. I’d walk around the house asking who was there. I looked for cameras, as I thought my parents were trying to catch me doing something I was not supposed to do. I would look up at the ceiling and say things like, “I know you’re there.” “Stop recording me, I know what you’re doing”, ect.
I had what I called my “emotion breaks”, which were little voices that would pop into my head. If they said something mean, I’d think it was my anger trying to talk to me. If they said something happy, I’d think it was my happiness trying to talk to me. I believed that my emotions had come to life in my brain, and they were talking to me.
I had very odd moments of confusion. I would be doing my normal thing, like homework, and suddenly, my brain would shift. I would very suddenly believe something very strange. For example, one time I thought that there were secret tunnels in my house that lead to the mall, I thought I had to find them to get to the mall. I would get up and look for them, wandering around my house, then I would think myself out of it. I would start having rational thoughts, like “Have I ever seen the inside of these tunnels before?” “Wouldn’t I know where the entrance was?” “I thought I got to the mall by car” Then I would realize, after a few minutes, there really aren’t any tunnels.",schizophrenia
1213,"A slow, draining, isolating spiral.
Everyone's experience is very different, in the early stages it's so minor it becomes normal. You don't quite notice how much worse it's getting over time because that's become your new normal.
It started small, thinking friends and family were calling me things when passing by or talking about me within hearing distance. Of course when confronted it was all denied, which creates an increasing sense of paranoia and distrust. It really starts to put a strain on your relationships. It's so small and infrequent it can be passed off as mishearing what someone said, so this is the new normal.
I couldn't really tell how much worse it had actually gotten because of that. It went from hearing and thinking my friends and family talk about me to thinking they were plotting to kill me. It made it hard to go out in public, make it through a shift, or even be alone. The delusions aren't always the same, but the same one can persist for long periods of time making it hard to trust anyone. You don't really notice what's going on or how bad it's gotten until it's starting to have a massive impact on your life.
It runs in the family, so after a certain point my friends and family started assuming that's what it was. I was able to start treatment and get help a lot earlier than a lot of people. It was about a year before I got treated of small accounts. Increasing paranoia. Until eventually you're convinced you're speaking to the internet, constantly being watched, can hear people's thoughts, speaking with God, etc.",schizophrenia
1214,"First, I was just answering my thoughts with my own thought, meaning I had an active conversation with myself; it seems normal at first. Then, strangely, I hear the radio or TV seem to be talking about me (or at least I suspected it was about me). This seemed to just go away at first, with 2–3 week intervals, and then it became a week, and then just days apart. I was actively having a discourse in my head. Well, it must have made me think that I was on to something different that just a handful of people on Earth have, so I kept this to myself. This made it difficult to turn back at this point. I guess it’s just the way it works. Our brains trick us into believing something that just isn't “normal”.
There were also times early on when people I didn’t know really did seem to know me; I mean, I hear them talk about me, which I just brushed off. Strangely though, they seem to know what's going on in my head. One time a mad man cursed me in the street, saying that I should stop what I’m doing or we're all gonna die! Just crazy you know, so this got me deeper and deeper into my insanity.
Sometimes when I looked at people their faces seemed bent, and so I just ignored all of these. In the early stages, I think the best thing to do is to have a healthy conversation with a “real” friend, and to visit a psychiatrist.",schizophrenia
1215,"It depends totally upon you. What does “Normal” means to you? I talk to myself all the time. I feel like its completely normal and most of us do it.
I usually talk to myself when I am feeling low. It helps me.
Is this only me or someone else also feel this way that when I talk to myself, usually thinking about my problems, I give myself the best advice. It surprises me sometimes. It feels as if there is someone inside your mind who cares for you the most. It’s that subconscious mind which amazes me all the time.
I think we all have a box of ideas and thoughts, which we lock away deep in the mind, and open it when we need it the most.
How amazing would It be if we had complete possession of that box? Do we even realize how many stupid shit we do all the time?
Actually, we do realize when that box opens.
Coming back to your question, I genuinely feel that It is completely normal.
I used to do it all the time. I wanted to write a book at some point of time. So, I used to listen to loud music and walk and walk and walk until my leg started burning. I used to make up stories about everything. This is something I even do now. I would suggest, try it. You will love it.
But, there is some downsides to it or at least in my case there was.
You will start enjoying yourself. You can be happy alone , which can make you kind of anti-social.
You cannot stand fake people.

1216,"My son didn’t have his first full-blown psychotic episode until he was 20. I had no idea what was going on, but in the year or two leading up to this, his behavior shifted.
He used to shower twice a day, would use hairspray to fix up his hair, and was always picking out nice clothes to look good. Then it got to where he wouldn’t shower for weeks and would smell like something died in his room because he wouldn’t clean anything.
He used to be social, would hang out with friends, and would associate with the rest of the family. Then it got to the point where he wanted to sleep all day and when he wasn’t sleeping he was just playing games or staring at his phone.
He used to be a great worker, would work hard, and make sure that everything was perfect. He would be on time every single day. Then it got to where he’d rarely show up for work.
He started accusing people of things. Stealing stuff from him. Then when his car wasn’t fixed by a mechanic he claimed he could hear the mechanic talking about “screwing him over” through the door.
Then one day, he claimed to have super hearing and could hear the people driving by in cars outside of the building having conversations. I took him to the E.R. and he got flagged for a psych hold.
It wasn’t a sudden thing, but nor was his behavior much different than an entitled 20-year-old just screwing around trying to figure life out. I later found out that in the early phases of Schizophrenia this type of behavior was common. People stop doing the things they used to do, typically with interests, activities, and even hygiene.
It is incredibly insidious, and I hate that it happened.",schizophrenia
1217,"PSY WARFARE
The operators use warfare tactics called “Psy Warfare.” These are tactics used by psychological warfare divisions of military agencies around the world, and they can quickly drive people crazy. In addition to forcing the victim to hear voices and sounds wherever they are physically at the time, these voices interact with their thoughts. Now, in addition to seeing and hearing everything the individual thinks passively, they can interact with their thoughts actively. Forcing the target to think about things they don’t want to, creating blocks in their thoughts, altering their course and cadence, and accentuating or creating severe intellectual problems. Mind Invasion/Control/Reading/Torture Technology is capable of inflicting immense torture, especially when the victim doesn’t understand what is happening and creates the anomalous reactive behavior expected by the usurpers. The use of V2K naturally leads people to question whether they are schizophrenic, but Synthetic Electronic Telepathy goes much further than that. Many voices from different people interact with all their thoughts, responding, joking and reacting every second, talking to each other, creating an echo in their thoughts, rehearsing vocalized thoughts that appear to be a very sophisticated schizophrenia. As this weapon becomes more popular, chaos will take shape. The walls of houses are no longer the limits of a person's residence, and privacy is being completely extinguished. The moment Synthetic Electronic Telepathy is connected to an individual's brain, all their vocalized thoughts are monitored and analyzed by unknown people in an arbitrary manner. It becomes an ideal and silent means of neutralizing any inconvenient person, any enemy. It can be used at any time, including to end the lives of other people silently, getting away with it, leaving no trace and without being held criminally responsible for their actions. Personally, I never thought that such technology existed or was at the level it is today until I “saw it with my own eyes.” When we read reports and documents that say that military and intelligence agencies keep secrets for years, it’s not a lie. When they say that a certain project is classified as Top Secret or Classified, you can believe it is! And its final form will only be revealed when it is needed in real combat. To see the abyss, the distance between military and advanced agency technologies and us, mere mortals, while we try to adapt to the online world, so important to our civilization, society turns all its attention and concern to privacy on the internet, day-to-day communication, social networks, however, without even knowing that real-life privacy has completely disappeared. Online privacy is important, of course, after all, our vital data travels through these networks daily. However, the excessive focus on online life serves in part as a distraction from the real threat, the theft of thoughts directly from the brain of anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time, by individuals who have access to Mind Invasion/Control/Reading/Torture Technology's infrastructure, without any kind of help to alleviate the suffering or to protect our cognitive data from theft by third parties. While we try to accommodate ourselves as a society on the internet, this technology is already working with a new internet of thoughts, or “Brain Net”, “Deep Brain Web” or “Dark Mind Web”.
If we compare it to a computer or the systems that make up a network, the brain and the mind, in the current situation, resemble an old and discontinued operating system without any type of protection against attacks, easily hackable, with infinite vulnerabilities, and, to make matters worse, it will naturally never have any type of native defense against this weapon, unfortunately. A system in which improvements or updates that close security gaps will never be implemented. No “patch” is on the way. Therefore, when a person becomes a target, a simple walk down the street, any solitary activity in which one is left alone with one’s thoughts becomes something painful, complicated, tiring and extremely stressful, because now the individual can no longer maintain the normal cognitive functioning of his or her mind as he or she always did. The simple act of contemplating a landscape, thinking about personal problems, making projections, observing people, watching time pass, reading a book or watching a film, become subordinate activities and practically cease to exist. Your thoughts and focus are now constantly directed to the issues that the invaders, hackers of the mind, want to bring to light, while your attention is completely directed to confronting these invaders, who become part of your life 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, uninterruptedly. The tactic of using attention diversion is intentional, as it is known that attention enables the entry of information from the external world, so for stimuli to be processed, they need to be perceived, and everything we perceive depends entirely on our attention. So, the irrelevant, non-priority stimulus that should be inhibited becomes the main focus, and the stimuli that should be a priority — work-related issues, social interaction with spouses, children, relatives and friends, attention to the surrounding environment for self-preservation, learning, reading, among others — become secondary, are not stored, and the computed and experienced stimuli are not perceived, supplanting important information, keeping unknown people in total control of the focus and attention, who will arbitrarily command what will be processed by the target, the information, the external stimuli that are so necessary for our lives. This inverts the natural order of the cognitive mechanics of a healthy brain. Operators will easily know your concerns, all it takes is a thought, a mental micro-reflex, and thus steal your afflictions. The moment you are about to take an important test that would define your professional future, a test or the interview of your life, voices of various levels of clarity will begin to emerge within your brain, in an unimaginable way! They will bring up issues from your personal life, generating internal distractions that are impossible to block, with internal and external stimuli, reviving your worries, generating anguish and anxiety, completely diverting your focus from what is important at the moment and reverting your concentration to a state of concern, destroying all your preparation and the test itself, including generating the primary feeling of anger, an overwhelming desire to shout: “Shut up!” At this point, your test, your exam or your interview will be completely compromised. The person whose mind is connected to the mind-reading system cannot free themselves from the invaders at any time of the day, becoming hostage to those who are operating the technology, interacting systematically, intervening in every daily thought, banal or not, making a point of showing that they are “in control” constantly, requesting casual rescues such as “do a certain action and you will be free”, often involving the target in serious crimes, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, assaults, but without ever freeing the victim from electronic captivity. The most worrying thing is that they start using the kidnapped mind as a source of entertainment, a perverse sport practiced with humans, known as “Torture for fun”. The target becomes a captive animal, the main attraction of a morbid zoo where visitors attack, whip and enjoy the howl of pain of this “human animal”. The gravity of the use of this technology as a weapon and its devastating effects on the human mind make the attacked people, from different nations, give it a series of names, the result of the philosophical interpretation of the phenomenon, such as “Mind Rape”. The victim feels literally violated by several other unknown people doing everything they can to their mind, disrespecting their privacy, activating unwanted memories, having fun with their feelings and emotions, and most shockingly, all of this happens in all areas of the target's daily life, especially in their own home, which they believe to be their private place and free from this type of harassment. Thus, they live in a kind of electromagnetic prison, deprived of all their senses. Some victims also report that they are prisoners of their own thoughts, since these thoughts, which should serve to refine perception and discriminate feelings, are now used against the target, harming human growth and their relative personal emphases that are so exposed. Others even compare them to Nazi concentration camps from the Second World War, but carried out remotely, using electronic means, such is the suffering imposed on the victim with its sordid and abject characteristics. Other people and perpetrators have also called it the Silent Holocaust.

1218,"Schizophrenia is related to ignorance and a particular kind of ignorance known as “atheism”.
When a person has a spiritual awakening this will sometimes result in hearing voices. When caused by a spiritual awakening this is almost always a spirit talking to them. Psychology, which is atheistic by their code of conduct, will call any and all of these experiences “schizophrenia”.
They need to stay in their lane. They know what Maslow’s Hammer is, but still they remain ignorant and use the same tool for every situation.
Short answer: No, schizophrenia is not related to intelligence, it is related to ignorance and atheism.",schizophrenia
1219,"The interplay between intellectual prowess, often denoted by a high IQ, and the propensity for certain psychological anomalies, colloquially termed 'madness', is a subject of deep scientific intrigue and scrutiny. Historically, many figures considered to be geniuses in their respective fields, from artists to scientists, exhibited erratic behavior or struggled with mental health issues. But is this pattern mere anecdote, or does empirical data substantiate a correlation?
Let's begin with some foundational concepts. Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a metric borne from standardized tests designed to measure an individual's cognitive abilities in relation to their age group. It acts as an indicator, albeit a somewhat limited one, of a person's analytical, mathematical, logical, and spatial abilities. But herein lies the first layer of complexity. IQ, while a potent marker of 'school-smart' capabilities, doesn't encapsulate the entirety of human intelligence or the psychosocial factors that come into play in daily life.
Delving into the realm of psychological disorders, one might ponder, what constitutes 'madness'? Historically, this term has been imbued with stigma and a lack of precise definition. However, in the modern lexicon of psychology, the spectrum of disorders ranging from mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia might be what individuals colloquially refer to when discussing 'madness'.
Several studies have posited potential links between high intelligence and certain psychological disorders. One hypothesis is rooted in the overexcitability theory. Here, individuals with heightened cognitive capacities often display increased sensitivities, imaginings, and intensities. These heightened states might render them more susceptible to a gamut of emotional and mental vulnerabilities.
For example, a person with a high IQ might exhibit hyper-brain/hyper-body dynamics, where their enhanced cognitive processing might be coupled with heightened physiological reactions to stress, leading to issues like anxiety or mood disorders.
Concurrently, the dopaminergic theory suggests that both high intelligence and certain mental disorders like schizophrenia share a neurochemical basis, particularly in how the brain processes dopamine. The intricate dance of neurotransmitters, specifically dopamine, within certain neurological pathways might be pivotal in determining both cognitive abilities and susceptibility to specific mental health issues.
Another avenue to consider is the evolutionary perspective, suggesting that the same genetic factors boosting cognitive abilities might also increase vulnerability to mental disorders. Essentially, the genes contributing to elevated cognitive skills might come with the trade-off of certain psychological vulnerabilities.
One also can't ignore the role of environmental factors. Highly intelligent individuals might experience asynchronous development, where their cognitive abilities surpass their emotional or social development. Such discrepancies can lead to feelings of isolation, misfit, or intense pressure to perform, all of which might exacerbate psychological stressors.
Considering these theories and findings, it's clear that the relationship between high IQ and psychological disorders is multifaceted, with a blend of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors at play. It's imperative to note that not everyone with a high IQ will experience mental health issues, and likewise, not everyone with a psychological disorder will have elevated intelligence.
The waters become murkier when considering the myriad of variables outside of IQ and psychological anomalies. For instance, socioeconomic status, early life experiences, and the availability of supportive resources play undeniable roles in the mental well-being of an individual. A person with a high IQ may reside in an environment that nurtures their talents and provides ample psychological support, reducing the likelihood of them developing mental health issues. Conversely, another intellectually gifted person in an unsupportive environment might be more prone to psychological distress.
Another nuance emerges when looking at creativity—a trait often associated with intelligence. Some researchers propose that highly creative individuals might share cognitive similarities with those diagnosed with certain psychological disorders. The cognitive disinhibition theory posits that creative people, like those with some mental health conditions, might have a reduced filter for environmental stimuli. This reduced filtering allows them to connect seemingly unrelated concepts, a hallmark of creativity. Yet, this very trait could also lead to sensory overload or heightened vulnerability to disorders like anxiety.
Furthermore, the role of epigenetics cannot be ignored. Epigenetics, the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself, might shed light on how environmental factors can influence the genetic predispositions linked to both high IQ and mental disorders. Certain experiences or external stressors might activate or deactivate genes associated with cognitive abilities or psychological vulnerabilities.
Another dimension worth exploring is the potential for misdiagnosis among those with high IQ. There's a notion that gifted individuals, especially children, can sometimes exhibit behaviors mistaken for disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder. A child with an exceptional IQ might exhibit restlessness or boredom in a classroom not tailored to their needs, which could be misinterpreted as symptoms of ADHD. While there's a clear distinction between giftedness and these disorders, the overlap in some behavioral traits underscores the importance of comprehensive psychological assessments.
While the relationship between high IQ and mental disorders is a subject of continuous exploration, one element remains indisputable: the necessity for a holistic approach to understanding and supporting the mental well-being of intellectually gifted individuals. It's not sufficient to merely focus on the neurological or genetic aspects; the environment, personal experiences, and broader societal context play pivotal roles in shaping the psychological trajectories of those with exceptional cognitive abilities.
In practical terms, the implications are significant. Tailored educational programs for gifted children, early intervention strategies, and increased awareness among educators and parents can aid in harnessing the potential of these individuals while ensuring their emotional and psychological well-being.",schizophrenia
1220,"No. It is a boundaries problem. Schizophrenia happens when sensory boundaries are too weak or not guarded well. Can happen to anyone. People with intelligence often have good logical abilities and logical abilities are rarely affected by any mental disorders. It's always the feelings and thoughts that are affected as is the case with schizophrenia- bodily feelings, voices, sense of smell, seeing and taste are affected. It doesnt affect intelligence. But yes, it does affect awareness esp due to sensory engagement in delusions and hallucinations and that affects concentration so the person might think more slowly or have focusing, memory related issues. But wisdom or intelligence is not affected.",schizophrenia
1221,"I'm not a psychiatric, but I know schizophrenia is a very negative mental disorder if not treated well.
For me, intelligence is measured on two things:
How good citizen someone can be, because that's a sign someone knows how to use their brain for the good of humankind.
How good their cognitive skills and behavioral traits are, like memory, motor skills, calculus, speed of processing, language, coherence in words, social skills, personal hygiene, how to make a snowman etc. Because those are signs of a healthy brain.
So, schizophrenia attacks those fields of the brain, which in the worst of the cases, the person isn't able to perform well at neither of those fields.
So, the answer is no, schizophrenia isn't part of intelligence.",schizophrenia
1222,"There is no correlation between IQ (higher or lower) and schizophrenia. Intelligent people can get schizophrenia as well and people with lower IQs.
Of course, when someone is fully psychotic they probably won’t be able to perform on an IQ test, so some people get the false idea that intelligent people don’t get schizophrenia, but that is simply not the case.
Schizophrenia happens in about 1% of the population worldwide, and it doesn’t discriminate.",schizophrenia
1223,"As I stated in a previous response to a so called pyschologist it is not the intelligence of a person who suffers schizophrenia you should be concerned about. When I was diagnosed with schizophrenia looking back it was no wonder I ran from the diagnosis and ruined my life in the process. Every doctor and pychologist I talked to had treated me in a way that made me believe my life was over and I was a legal assistant at the time of my diagnosis. They made me fill out this piece of paper that asked what you did for a living. I proudly put down Legal Assistant which I had been for two years. I was newly diagnosed and not even as having schizophrenia at that time just as having a brief pyschotic episode and she wanted to lock me in a rooming house with “others who were like me”. That attitude scared me by a woman who didn't seem to care that I had never been in trouble before and I had a good job. She just wanted to lock me somewhere. I lived with family and it made me question had they expressed a desire to have me live somewhere else? Being in a “ward “ for the first time was scary and to hear this woman say she wanted to lock me somewhere with people I don't know was even scarier. I denied having a disease for a long time because of the way I was always treated inside one of these facilities. My intelligence didn't just magically dissapear because I had this diagnosis yet I'd never hear any doctor or pyschologist say this is temporary. The symptoms are temporary as long as you take your medicine you can still have a full life. You can have your career. You can get married. My two biggest concerns. Instead I always left the hospital feeling unloved and unwanted and like all my dreams and hardwork were for nothing. I was even attacked once in a hospital by security because I was distraught over police treatment of me. I won't go into detail but it left me emotionally scared. The police and the hospital staff pretty much attacked me because I didn't want their help. I refused treatment. The doctors talked down to you and looked down on you. And normal actions that a normal person might have done were now attached to having a mental illness. It was like I was no longer a human being. I was a subject to be dissected. I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia for six years. I'm as intelligent as I've always been. I still have a high appetite for literature and books. I'm still curious. I'm still working and best of all I still work meaning the functions of my brain and body still work. Yes I'm a little sluggisgh to get out of bed in the morning but that's alot of people without an illness. I can talk fast sometimes, which I've done my whole life but other than that I don't have symptoms while on medication. And I realize this is not all people diagnosed with schizophrenia. I find there are alot of pyschologist therapist and pyschiatrist who have low opinions of people with schizophrenia and if you let them insert their opinion of you or the disease into your life you may create a self fulfilling prophesy that manifested because someone told you you were this or that. Schizophrenia has nothing to do with intelligence. Take the medication and you can do whatever you put your mind to. If you have a therapist pyschologist or pychiatrist you see and that say things like this one pyscholosigt said on this answer thread trying to sound smart fire them these people are suppouse to be here to help you not hinder you. Had I believed in myself all those years ago I might be married now. I might have finished my degree and most of all I would've never gone to jail for not taking medication.
My father and i butt head sometimes but one thing he always says to me is to not use excuses some of these so called doctors incorrectly don't have a high opinion of you will give you an excuse to lay in bed and mope and let your life pass you by. That's another stigma your feeding by listening to them. Go out there and conquer your dreams one at a time and remember to take your medicine regularly. Ignore all naysayers.",schizophrenia
1224,"I thought I read somewhere that mental illness and higher intelligence may be linked, though I’m not sure about schizophrenia in particular.
One thing to note is that pre and post-diagnosis IQ will be different in most cases. The disease and often the medication/treatment can affect cognitive abilities. I had a rough patch where it was difficult to sort out simple math problems.
So if you are comparing those already diagnosed with the average IQ, I’d bet it is below average. However, remember a higher IQ certainly doesn’t impart insight or wisdom; most IQ measurements are just a reference for how efficiently you can solve relatively difficult problems.",schizophrenia
1225,"In recognizing what ""madness"" is, we must, as Michel Foucalt said, recognize that we cannot make sense of clinical models of insanity without the social and historical constructions of knowledge in which they operate.
Madness, like high IQ, is simply one kind of behavior that does not conform to the societal norm. Geniuses with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are often brilliant artists and writers - examples being Van Gogh, Jack Kerouac, and Virginia Woolf.
Existential psychologist Ernst Becker says of schizophrenics: ""The creativity of people on the schizophrenic end of the human spectrum is a creativity that springs from the inability to accept the standardized cultural denials of the real nature of experience. … The schizophrenic is supremely creative in an almost extra-human sense because he is furthest from the animal: he lacks the secure instinctive programming of lower organisms; and he lacks the secure cultural programming of average men. No wonder he appears to average men as “crazy”: he is not in anything’s world.""
Some researchers say ""yes"" to your question, but one can argue that their sample pool was too small. There IS a link between genius and madness
Perhaps geniuses are needed in society in order to make sure that attention to the psyche and collective unconscious, revealed in art, is sufficient. If everybody was completely ""sane"" and behaved rigidly confined to the norm, without intellectual openness, I have no idea what dystopic society we'd be living in much worse than the current one.
Btw- I test as ""profoundly gifted"" and suffered from clinical depression which can be considered one kind of madness.",schizophrenia
1226,"I have an IQ in the top .1%, literally. And it wasn’t always easy.

1227,"I believe that Sigmund Freud said, that genius was next to insanity. There are many popular people with brilliant minds that were considered mentally unstable or mentally ill maybe that is a better way to express it. They have achieve great things in their life time such as John Nash that had schizophrenia was a Nobel Prize winner for economics, and he had a great career in mathematics, and also he had something to do with game theory; and he always try to solve the Riemann Hypothesis.
Van Gosh was another brilliant mind that had mental illness; he had some great paintings like starry night, but he never got the credit for his paintings till later after his death; so in frustration he cut off hos ear, and he die poor.
kantor that had a great mathematical mind, and he was a top mathematician in his time; and he put together set theory; but he was severely criticize for it, and he wound up in an asylum; and it's also known that people with mental illness are very creative.",schizophrenia
1228,"AFAIK the main difference may be in verbal IQ, as a ratio of IQ subsets related to eachother. But it seems inconclusive.
Some may say there is a cognitive deficit, attention deficit and others aspects like social intelligence. These are acute and variable states, linked more to dissociation or ‘being in a state of confusion’ sometimes, and not suggestive of intrinsic intelligence like IQ. If you are like me you might have a varied intelligence. I often just have mental exhaustion from mental health issues. Next day may be fine and feel like a genius relative to what i was the day before. I’ve never tested my IQ.",schizophrenia
1229,"My grandmother, who passed away this month, was a highly intelligent Schizophrenic. The reason why people say Schizophrenics are “dumb,” is because they let their delusions fool them. And their grades drop, etc. The reason why Schizophrenics have lower grades is not because they are unintelligent, but that they are so stuck in their head that they can't put their intelligence and knowledge into words.
A lot of Schizophrenics are smarter than the average person. Why? Because they spend so much time in their head, they think things through more often— and even though they often cannot fully perceive their intelligent thoughts and ideas, they're still there.
Schizophrenics have a hard time relating to people and using language properly. I mean body language and other signals, they're often stoic without a care or completely miss most social cues. Social things might not be a Schizophrenic's specialty, but they are definitely capable of being highly intelligent.",schizophrenia
1230,"Schizophrenia has zero impact on intelligence, but it might affect or impair how that intelligence is able to be expressed to the general public.
People with schizophrenia are statistically like anyone else in that area - most are average (like in the general population), with some people who are at the lower end of the spectrum, and some who are absolutely off the charts brilliant.
A lot of times people confuse the symptoms of schizophrenia with a lack of intelligence…for example, they assume that someone who is talking to someone who isn’t visible to them isn’t “smart.” Unfortunately, while the general public mistreats and makes fun of those who have this disorder, those who experience it notice the stigma, those snide remarks, and ridicule more than they know.
Perhaps it’s why, after depression and substance use disorders, people with schizophrenia have very high rates of suicide. They are more than aware of how others see/treat them, they are often also aware that the life they dreamed for themselves may never happen, and it can be incredibly emotionally taxing.",schizophrenia

1232,"As someone who has schizophrenia (But now stable on medications) I can say that if you're under the effects of the illness, your intelligence, if we consider it as your ability to read reality in wideness and profoundity correctly, deteriorates.
Now, reality in its appearance and surface level looks as it does look (For us humans), but the meanings we assign to it, vary from individual to individual;
If we would reason through reality on surface levels, we would understand its wideness, but not its profoundity, in the same way as living in a two dimensional world is not more immersive than living in a three dimensional world.
By simple percentuals, where schizophrenics include around 0.3%~ of the general population and if we relate it to the 0.01%~ of the general population who has an exceptionally high IQ (IQ 160+) , the chanches for the two criterias to overlap by forming an exceptional high IQ + Schizophrenia result as barely existent;
The correlation is a myth, but answering the question forms new questions, such as :
Is the absence of meaning which we as humans usually assign to the world (reality) the “true objective eye, which sees the world as it is, instead as how we prefer to see it”?
Does schizophrenia assigns new meanings to reality, in the same way as in the past the first humans assigned words and letters to specific sounds, pictures, objects, etc.?
Does IQ reflects only in its high score your ability to integrate in society, according to its actual and present rules, but does not reflect your ability to engineer new societal structures?
Etc.
Thank you for reading.",schizophrenia
1233,"Not really, there are people with low IQ’s that get the mental illness and there are very intelligent people that also get schizophrenia.

1234,"People with schizophrenia experience cognitive decline. Hence, if they were to improve, their cognitive functioning, not intelligence, would improve!
Research studies in this area have found that a persons intelligence quotient (as measured by clinical scales such as the Wechsler Intelligence scales) remains relatively stable over time. These findings also apply for people diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Perhaps the variability of cognitive decline experienced by individuals with schizophrenia can be confusing for people to grasp.
Rapid-Onset Vs Gradual Cognitive Decline
Some people experience rapid onset cognitive decline (for example, 6 -12 months) after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.
In contrast, other people diagnosed with schizophrenia tend to experience a more gradual and slower decline (for example, 1–10 years) in their cognitive functioning.
The term cognitive decline is so broad that most people struggle to comprehend what it actually means. I believe that it is important to spell out the areas of cognitive decline experienced by people with schizophrenia.
In fact, one of the the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia states that the person must experience symptoms leading to a functional decline for at least six months.
Many people confuse cognitive decline with negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I will attempt to elaborate on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia below.
Negative symptoms of schizophrenia include:
emotional blunting,
poor social functioning,
apathy,
difficulty concentrating, and
memory difficulty.
People with schizophrenia also experience what we term as positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms of schizophrenia mainly include the psychotic symptoms associated with the disorder.
Positive symptoms of schizophrenia
Hallucinations,
Delusions,
Disorganised Thinking,
Abnormal Motor Behaviour.
Schizophrenia: Areas of cognitive decline
People with schizophrenia experience significant cognitive impairment. The specific type of cognitive impairment varies significantly between individuals. Moreover, the rate of cognitive decline also varies significantly between our different cognitive functions.
I listed memory problems in the above-mentioned list of symptoms associated with cognitive decline. People experience cognitive decline in the following areas:
learning of new information and
retention of verbal information,
deficits in executive functioning and impaired ability to encode and retain verbally presented information.
It is not uncommon for people diagnosed with schizophrenia to drop out of their courses of study due to the above-me ruined symptoms of schizophrenia.
People with schizophrenia report having difficulties remembering lecture material. They also struggle preparing for exams and find it gets to able remember information on their exams.
The broad spectrum of symptoms that schizophrenia sufferers experience are profound! They cause significant disruption in almost every sphere of their lives.
Hence, it is important for people to better understand the disorder and its effects on the individual. I would add that we need to have empathy for people with schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1235,"I am a schizophrenic 26 year old who has a pretty high iq from what most people seem to think. Having been born with the illness, it was genetically passed down and i was diagnosed as a child, my mother had a rough time raising me but it wasnt like this illness was my fault. Schizophrenia just happens to both low iq and high iq people. That being said the last iq test i took was in school, but my intelligence didnt actually take form until the age of 22, weird right? Well most wouldnt understand but ive been on several different meds over the years and the current working ones(30mg abilify 2mg risperdone) actually have no drowsy effects. I firmly believe that the majority of schizophrenics who take meds with drowsy effects lose out on having a higher brain function. Being sleepy all the time reduces the speed at which youre brain proccesses information and there by making you slow and stupid looking. Granted i sometimes have those stupid looking expressions as well until i open my mouth a computer comes out of it. Lol just kidding of course. But i am very smart with computers, having built several custom computers, learning advanced virus removal and even programming in php and C#, sometimes i wonder if my brain is a computer? Oh right it technically is :-P
Most people who meet or talk to me have 0 idea that i have an illness until i tell them.....and being 6 feet 7 inches tall plus schizophrenic makes a lot of people run for the hills. Id rather hide it then tell someone.
So to answer your question. Schizophrenics can be intelligent. The intelligent ones are harder to distinguish from actual people with no illness. You could even have a Schizophrenic as your best friend and you wouldn't even know it ;)",schizophrenia

1238,"Yes and no. There have been numerous people in recent history that have achieved incredible breakthroughs in science, technology, and things such as ""game theory"". John Forbes Nash was the cornerstone for the revision of ""Game Theory"" and ""Governing Dynamics"" - Also known as the ""Nash Equilibrium"" - Which ended up getting him a Nobel Price in the 1990's. He is schizophrenic, and has been since his time at Princeton (and perhaps before). There is some correlation, but it depends on a case by case basis. There is often a complex grandiose thinking associated with the disorder, so some people may seem to spew intelligence when it is not necessarily logical or valid. People with schizophrenia do tend to be introverts, and that can contribute to a very high level of mental capacity and creative - But also a high level of emotional and social destruction.",schizophrenia
1239,"Yes, there's probably a lot of reasons why, but here's a few that come to mind:
Frustration: it's very frustrating to be dealing with problems (usually at work, but other places too) that, since the person is smart, they have very good ideas on how to solve, but since they haven't been promoted that high into management, they can't enact changes. Ever try to suggest an idea to upper management? They'll say something like thanks for the suggestion and then never use it. So we end up suffering because we're working for someone who not only has a lower IQ, but isn't self-aware enough to take a good suggestion when it's given.
Lots of boring training & education before getting to a job that fits your intelligence. Think about it: the valedictorian and the kids who barely graduated high school have the same gen Ed requirements in college. How is that fair? How does it make sense? As condescending as this sounds, I was a better writer as a sophomore in high school than a lot of people are when they graduate college. I shouldn't have to waste time and money on classes like English comp. But the harm comes from forcing these people to sit through hours of school every day or week, where the lecture can't keep their attention, since it isn't challenging enough. The only classes I had in high school that I had to pay attention in were math. So basically I spent 25 hours+ a week sitting quietly in a class room with no mental stimulation at all. That's enough to make most people crazy. The same is true in college and in employment. It'd be nice if they would just give the option to test out of every single class if you're capable. Study for a couple weeks, take a test, get the credit. They have CLEP tests, but only for a few courses.
Difficulty relating to others: I tend to either over or under-estimate the intelligence of others. Either one is really bad for social relationships. If you talk to someone as though they're at the same IQ level as you, they have no clue what you're talking about and you can't have a conversation like that. Then I sometimes over-adjust, and talk to them like they're a lower IQ than what they are, which is just insulting. And sometimes a situation will occur where I'm left shocked.. For example, seeing a coworker who I really respect trying to solve a relatively simple math problem and struggling. It gives this feeling that there is literally no one who I can ask for help solving a problem, because even my best coworker is over here getting stumped by basic algebra. It can also be difficult to keep your ego in check at times, to be honest. I've had people question why I made a certain decision at work, for example, and it's a little bit annoying because I always end up thinking to myself “I'm not an idiot, why is he acting like I don't know what I'm doing?” And I think that that is actually the same problem in reverse, other people are underestimating my intelligence.
Boredom: sort of related to #2. For very intelligent people, unless they're in research or maybe engineering new technologies, will master most other jobs within a year or two. Even in higher level jobs.
High expectations: Most people with high intelligence are noticed as being smart pretty early on. Listening to people telling you that maybe you'll go cure cancer, or solve world hunger, or design some amazing new technology for your whole childhood basically means one thing: You will almost definitely fall short. And it makes it feel like you're a failure, even in what others might consider a good job (“Yes, I'm a doctor, but I haven't made any real contributions to research or science.”)",schizophrenia
1240,"listen my sotry. In January 2023 I was to the psychiatrist with rather depression problem. I never had not any psychosis, illusions etc., just I told him about emotionally problems. And what? Motherfucker told me that I am schizotypical personality and prescribed me... Olanzapine! Fucking olanzapine when I have not any psychosis in my life, any hallucinations, and my life was absolutely non-schizophrenic! I studied at university, I liked walking, reading books, riding on my bicycle and I told him about it. Fuckin moron, why did he want destroy it? These meds did not helped me at all, maybe I was just little more sleepy. And that's it. But when I quit it a hell was started - anhedonia, dumbness, insomnia, memory loss, depersonality, alogia.. Why this fuckin idiot thought that quality of my life is as bad as life of schizophrenic person?? Now this fucking duchebag saying to me: it's impossible that you suffering because of olanzapine, it can't damage your brain and can't cause these problems, the problems are because the were in you... Olanzapine destroyed my life because of him and you know what this fucker told me? ""it's necessary consider benefits what's better - taking olanzapine or living like you living"". Are you get it?

1241,"You sleep all the time, can’t concentrate, have mild delusional toughts and social withdrawal (that mimic symptoms of schizophrenia), your toughts get confused. After the medications are suspended, all the sleepiness and delusional toughts go away, and you can concentrate again, and think perfectly clearly, but you may be left with lifelong severe depression, as your brain was damaged by the medication.
I carried a schizophrenia diagnosis for 15 years. I actually have Asperger’s syndrome, but Aspergers was a totally unknown condition in my country at the time, and the “standard” diagnosis for everyone with mild autism was schizophrenia. After all, you acted strange, you couldn’t fit, you were crazy. I was put on endless medications, and all them only worsened my situation - it was believed to be the natural progression of schizophrenia. I lacked the classical hallucinations, but that didn’t matter back then.",schizophrenia
1242,"In a long term, with a lower dose, I developed anhedonia and lack of motivation. In a short term, with a higher dose - cognitive dysfunction.
I had restlessness, palpitations, and insomnia due to the chronic overtreatment with levothyroxine (a thyroid medication). It was misdiagnosed as an anxiety disorder, and I was given an antidepressant. It didn’t help. Then a doctor gave me Rexulti - a relatively “mild” antipsychotic.
Initially, at 0.5mg/day, I felt better. Not sure why - maybe the drug blocked alpha-adrenergic receptors, working essentially as an antidote for Levo. Maybe something else. But for about two months, I felt better - calmer; heart palpitations were gone; my mood was better, although sleep wasn’t good.
In two months, a doc upped my dose to 1 mg. In 10 days I started feeling worse: slow; depressed; tired; feeling muscle cramps. I developed depression to the point where it was difficult to get out of bed. The worst thing was a complete cognitive dysfunction. I was a software engineer, and that was a nightmare. I suddenly become dumb, really dumb. I could look for hours at a code of a program that I had previously written - and could not understand it. I could try reading the documentation - and could not understand it. If I was trying to force myself doing that - I was getting severe headache, and then - nausea. Interestingly, doing manual labor - like carpentry, for example - was OK. I was a bit slow - but I could do things, no problem.
I stopped the antipsychotic, and in 3 weeks my symptoms resolved - although my sleep become bad, and I started feeling restless again (because, my dose of levothyroxine was same - too high). So I had to re-start Rexulti at 0.5 mg.
Overall, about 6 months after I started Rexulti, I noticed loss of interest to things. Things that I greatly enjoyed in the past - boating, fishing, hunting - would not give me strong emotions anymore. With time, I become more and more apathetic. Eventually, I lost any motivation to do anything - like reading books, or fixing things around the house, or working in a garden. I was spending weekends playing World of Warships - not because it was fun and enjoyable, but just because it helped to pass time.
Fortunately, another psychiatrist sorted things out. He realized that my symptoms were caused by the overdose of levothyroxine. I lowered my dose of levo by 3x, and started tapering antipsychotic.
In a month, after dropping the dose from 0.5 to 0.25 mg, my motivation and cognition improved. I started to be more productive at work; more motivated to do things and to learn things, more interested in life overall. I started making plans for the future - something unheard of me before.
In another month, I stopped the med entirely. The withdrawal symptoms lasted for months, most notably - severe insomnia and tremors in my hands. To the point that I had trouble writing at times, not even speaking of hitting a target with a rifle - my wife was shooting better than I do, every single time.
Now, six months after stopping the drug I can consistently hit a bullseye, like before. Although the anhedonia starts to improve only now.
But I feel much, much better overall.",schizophrenia
1243,"I have used a few and I'm not schizophrenic:
Clozapine: not by far a typical antipsychotic (in fact the exact opposite), makes you EXTREMELY sleepy. Also mellow and stuff doesn't get to you at all, it makes you pretty calm and functional if you're kind of anxious (not any kind of anxious of course, that's your shrink's decision). Makes you very fat too but that's a bit off-topic. The sleepiness, even during the whole day was really bothersome. I used a 50mg dose which is not really an ideal dose for an actual schizophrenic though, it's kinda low. Takes away pretty much any suicidal ideation you might have for some reason. It's THE most effective drug in schizophrenia.
Amisulpride: I'm using it now. The dose is a bit closer to the one for schizophrenia (200mg a day). Makes me more outgoing actually, and maybe a bit calmer. It may be because I have Asperger's though and every autist of sorts is a bit hypersensitive to stuff.
Risperidone: Only took once, for curiosity and because I was really on edge emotion-wise that particular day (I have access to a lot of free samples of lots of drugs). Made me sleepy and pretty peaceful. Makes people with really short fuses much more manageable and mellower in my experience (as a prescriber).
Asenapine: Don't know why but this made me disphoric, sleepy but not calm in fact kind of nervous, and when I went to sleep it was very disturbed sleep and not refreshing. Also when awake unable to stay still (acathysia). I really tried but was horrible.
As for the typicals (haldol etc.), it would be like someone else already said: emotionally blunt, unmotivated, don't care about anything and all that. Kind of like a zombie. This is partly what made people in sanatariums in the old days be weird and zombie-like. But you would feel these kinds of things a bit less the more you used it though, and depends on the dose.
It's necessary sometimes. I know they can be bad because I'm a Neurology resident and we sometimes have to deal with severe motor side effects of these drugs, but almost all medications in the market have some kind of scenario where they're better than not using anything, really.
Obs. I was prescribed every one of these drugs at some point in time, the only one I ever took any as self-medication was the one time I took Risperidone.",schizophrenia

I was having muscle spasms I began hitting my sister she woke up and was asking me if I was ok and what was happening. I was having a severe panic attack which lead to heart palpitations I instantly stood up. I was so confused my mind was so muddled I couldn’t think. My mouth was so dry and I was shivering. I had a shortness of breath and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest and I was excessively sweating. My dad was downstairs it’s all a blur so I can’t really remember I’ve mostly been told what happened. I ran outside to the pool where I was so much sheer panic I jumped in the pool ( which has left great big bruises on my legs) everything that was happening I kept forgetting. I can’t remember much else other than feeling panicked, attaching my sister, feeling like I was having a heart attack. I don’t remember getting in the pool or running outside.

1247,"The important thing to remember is, your physical responses to antipsychotic medications are likely to not be the same for those people who need and are accustomed to having these types of medication in his/her system. Hopefully, the actual response by someone who isn't ill, will only be muted, but it could be something else entirely and could even be dangerous.
Odds are good that only exaggerated side effects will be felt, such as sedation turning into a heavy sleep that just makes you pass out for 20 hours. Maybe your mouth will be as dry as the Sahara Desert. You might have poor balance and a weak grip. Dizziness and an inability to keep your eyes open, particularly when waiting for a light change at an intersection. Other possible side effects of antipsychotics could be so much worse.
People who actually benefit from using antipsychotics will experience responses that reduce disabling effects.They have developed a tolerance for the drug; i.e. a therapeutic level has been reached that helps control the presence of unwanted behavior. Hopefully, mood swings that were present, have slowed and possibly disappeared. If currently manic or hypomanic, the symptoms sthould dissipate, making life a bit easier to manage.

1248,"Anti-psychotic medication is given to people that experience psychotic symptoms with the intention of symptom relief. Schizophrenia is one example of a psychological disorder that causes psychotic symptoms in the sufferer.
Most people that take anti-psychotic medication for the treatment of psychotic disorders usually report a reduction in the frequency and severity of the psychotic symptoms they experience. They also report that they feel better overall and that they are able to engage in activities that they couldn’t participate in prior to taking the medication (for example, socialise, watch television or listen to music).
Antipsychotic medications: Side-effects
Antipsychotic medications have side-effects like most other medications. They include weight gain, sedation and in some cases, people experience extrapyramidal side-effects.
Extra-pyramidal symptoms may include:
acute dyskinesias,
tardive dyskinesia,
akinesia, and
akathisia.
Not all people on anti-psychotic medications experience extra-pyramidal symptoms. Some people may only experience one of the above symptoms for a short period of time (usually during the first months of commencing antipsychotic medication).
There are many factors that determine the extent of side-effects associated with antipsychotic medication. The following factors can influence the severity and frequency of side-effects:
Type of antipsychotic (for example, people on Clozapine are likely to experience side-effects),
Drug dosage,
Long term use of antipsychotic,
Drug interactions (mixing another drug with antipsychotics),
Genetics,
Phenotype,
Gender,
Weight,
Height,
Metabolic rate,
Many other factors.
Impact of antipsychotics when taken for non-psychotic conditions
Doctors generally do not prescribe anti-psychotic medications to people that have not experienced psychotic symptoms. However, some anti-psychotics like Seroquel, have multiple uses, .
Seroquel can be prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders, mood disorders, seizures, eating disorders and more than 100 conditions. In fact, too many Doctors have been prescribing Seroquel for off the shelf conditions.
Given that anti-psychotics are also classed as major tranquillisers, most people experience sedation and drowsiness. Lower doses of antipsychotics (for example, 25mg to 100mg of Seroquel) may not result in significant sedation the morning after in some individuals.
Moreover, some people that take high doses of antipsychotics or more than one antipsychotic medication (without having a psychotic condition) report the absence of anxiety. They also report that they find it difficult motivating themselves.
In small doses, antipsychotics like Seroquel can assist people with insomnia to get some sleep (for example doses such as 25–50 mg). Seroquel is not considered to be a hypnotic medication or a sleeper.
Generally speaking, antipsychotics should not be prescribed for non-psychotic conditions. There are thousands of medications that have been developed for specific conditions and it is recommend that a Doctor prescribe these drugs before prescribing antipsychotic medications.

1249,"Actually “antipsychotic” is a poor name, this class of psychiatric medications used to be called “neuroleptics”. They tend to block dopamine D receptors in the dopaminergic pathways of the brain, which are implicated in a wide variet of psychiatric disorders.
Antipsychotics such as Seroquel(quietiapine) is used, at lower doses, as an adjunct to antidepressants in major depression and also often used for bipolar illnesses. It can also be used as a sleep medication, and I found it to be one of the best, without leading to severe grogginess in the morning.
Taking large doses, as prescribed for schizophrenia, can lead to many side effects. The adverse effects range from relatively minor tolerability issues (e.g., mild sedation or dry mouth) to very unpleasant (e.g., constipation, akathisia, sexual dysfunction) to painful (e.g., acute dystonias) to disfiguring (e.g., weight gain, tardive dyskinesia) to life threatening (e.g., myocarditis, agranulocytosis).
I suggest looking at the Wikipedia article on Antipsychotics, as there are many types and second generation “atypical” antipsychotics are very different, as are those that are called “third generation antipsychotics”.",schizophrenia
1250,"I take antipsychotics to prevent mental illness episodes that might include psychosis as a component. I don’t think they do anything for people who don’t have some form of MI, whether it be severe depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or some other serious mental illness. They do have side effects like weight gain and drowsiness, and that would be true of anyone who takes antipsychotics. So basically, they do nothing for a person who has no MI except make them fat, lazy, and sleepy.",schizophrenia
1251,"I’ll tell you, the antipsychotics are rough. Even a lot of people with schizophrenia dislike being on the medications, one person described it as feeling like having a feber. I definitely remember back when I got put on the max dose of trilafon, it was basically like a mild tunnel vision and a major discomfort. It doesn’t feel particulary good.
The antipsychotics have the opposite effect of most recreational drugs. Drugs like, cannabis, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine; they flood your brain with dopamine. These meds will block the dopamine receptors in your brain from connecting with the dopamine that’s being produced. Basically it empties your system of dopamine, so it’s like an anti-drug just making you feel drugged down without any of the pleasure.
I read an anti psychiatry book once by Robert Whitaker which actually told a story where normal people took anti psychotic medication. It was two people from a russian prison labor camp who got sent to a psychiatric institution after faking having a mental illness. It sounds unbelievable but they actually admitted to faking having a mental illness, and got sent back to the prison-labor camp and the reason was the medication was so unbearable.
For any normal person the meds would be like torture. Psychotic people can withstand a heavy amount of punishment; last time I was psychotic I actually ran full speed into a wall and broke my wrist. After lying on the ground, grunting for half a minute I got up and just sat calmly in a chair and smoked a cigarette. I felt no pain at all, and I refused the painkiller they gave me because I didn’t think I needed them.
I wouldn’t recommend these drugs for anyone, they just calm you down and make you compliant. If people would take the time to understand the mind of disorder we could actually have results with talk therapy. I’ve experienced the fact that other people with psychotic people have logic and reasoning even if it is different for us, then for people who are non-psychotic. It’s basically like a constant intoxication, if you can speak with a drunk person you got the basic of speaking to a psychotic person. This is my honest opinion.",schizophrenia

2. To make a long story short, I couldn't sleep well for the next week, couldn't go to class because of serious anxiety of having a panic attack, I literally felt like a zombie for the whole week, and I ended up in the hospital because I had a dystonic reaction from the medication. Besides the reaction, the most horrible part was waking up every morning hoping the effects wouldn't be there anymore, only to realize that they set in again after a good 10mins of being awake.
This drug is probably the most horrible thing I have ever done and it was because of my sheer ignorance to what I was taking that lead to my awful experience.
3. My boyfriend took six or seven, and I took about 5. What followed was 24 hours of getting up and feeling tired, but then when I laid down I had lots of energy.
4. I never really slept that night and awoke still very tired, but a little less tranquilized. The remainder of the next day was more physical discomfort and anxiety over when the experience would end. A disturbing occurrence was a series of mild hallucinations where I felt as though something was coming at me from my peripheral vision. It was equivalent to the shadowing that occurs if something was coming at you and all you saw was the changing of the light in your peripheral vision as the object blocked out the light source. The first time I winced, but soon realized it was a hallucination, though it continued from time to time.",schizophrenia
1253,"I can only talk about my personal experience, as I am not a doctor, however I have been in ongoing mental health treatment for over ten years. I’ll start by saying antipsychotics are not just used to treat schizophrenia, they are also used to treat individuals with bipolar and mania. I was on clozapine for several years to help with two different conditions I have, Unspecified Bioplar and Derealization/Depersonlization. For me they did have numbing effect, which sevral type of medcations used for the treatment of mental health condtions can have that effect. For me at that time in my life the numbing effect was much more favorable that what I had been experncing. That life in my life I was very suicidal. The numbing effect did help with my suicidal tendicies. As for me I would become extremely upset over somthing and that would lead me to attmept to take me own life. Due to the numbing effect I wouldn’t become as overful upset. When comes to my DRDP it helped a lot with my delusion and my touch with relality. I still had delusion here and there, but they didn’t hold as much weight. I could understand better why those delusion most likley weren’t true even though it felt like they were.",schizophrenia
1254,"Generally you will fall asleep. Deeply, deeply asleep. Thus depends on the medication but many of them are extremely sedating.
If you took it just one time this is likely all that will happen but in the long term you are likely to experience side effects which will vary depending on the chemical.
Just to be clear, do not do this. There is nothing to gain.",schizophrenia
1255,"I do not have psychoses, but have been prescribed three anti psychotics (not at once). Actually, they have very different side effects profiles on me, but as far as the positive effects, they all calm me down and reduce my emotional liability. Ability helps with depression. Both ability and Lurasidone have given me greater clarity of mind, but quetiapine got me confused (not as sharp as my mind can be, even up to feeling some level of fragmentation).
Side effects wise:
lurasidone: sleep disruption
Ability (over 2mg): agitation, can’t be still, feel my muscles are acting weird
Quetiapine: weight gain!!!! Sleepiness, fatigue, blurry vision
Not fun, but my current cocktail of drugs make me tolerate a lot my borderline personality disorder (though I do take so many drugs that it is quite laborious at times). No schizophrenia for me.",schizophrenia
1256,"People should never take drugs that were not prescribed for them by a medical professional who knows their medical status and history. Everyone is different. Your doctor should always know what you are taking and why; it should be his idea, not yours, for you to take any medicine.
OK. Speaking as one who has taken different “schizophrenia medicines” owing to the lack of medications made specifically for my illnesses (bipolar 1 and panic disorder), and having been prescribed those meds because they have antipsychotic and mood stabilizing effects (such as they are), I will just note 3 things from my experience, and you can draw your own conclusions from your own experience: (1) The side effects of these drugs have always outweighed their benefits for me, (2) It isn't the kind of medicine that will get you high or make you happy or cause interesting hallucinations, and (3) After it wears off and you feel less zombie-like, you will probably be grateful that you were just briefly curious, and glad that you don't have to take it all the time.",schizophrenia
1257,"Every patient will respond differently (just like with any med), but many patients take antipsychotics for approved and off-label reasons besides psychotic disorders, and many patients (including myself) do very well on them.
I’ve been on both Zyprexa and Seroquel for insomnia and other reasons, and I’ve had no side effects with either medication. Well, aside from sleepiness, but that’s the part that helps with the insomnia! I eventually settled on 100 mg of Seroquel every day at bedtime several years ago, and I’m still doing great with that.
(I was initially put on these meds for insomnia & depression with psychosis features, but we eventually figured out my hallucinations are caused by narcolepsy. But that’s a whole other story.)
I decided to try going off of Seroquel for several months in late 2021/early 2022, and it was an unmitigated disaster. I had a severe anxiety relapse, which led to a severe depressive episode (which led to me taking FMLA/short-term disability from work), then a hospital stay, then 2 months in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)… you get the idea.
Luckily, my IOP psychiatric provider put the pieces together and recommended trying Seroquel again. I was shocked! “But would I need an antipsychotic? We know I don’t have psychosis now.”
And that’s how I learned that Seroquel almost got FDA approval for anxiety disorders too, and it’s commonly used off-label for this very reason. Seroquel (and some other antipsychotics) can be very effective for patients who don’t respond to first-line anxiety treatments. And guess what? She was right, it really does help with my anxiety.
(It’s not a magic pill or anything; there were lots of other factors involved in my recovery process, but Seroquel has definitely helped, along with some narcolepsy med changes and plenty of therapy.)",schizophrenia
1258,"So I’m kind of wondering why you’d be taking a medication for schizophrenia if you don’t have it…these are serious drugs and are not prescribed to just anyone. Are you sick but just don’t realize it because you’re so mired in your sickness? Or are you sick with something else and you’re taking an adjunctive antipsychotic to help with that?
Putting that aside, and assuming you might be entertaining taking an antipsychotic for kicks even though you’re not ill (although I’m not sure why…but whatever)…taking most APs will make you sleepy and may lift your mood slightly. It’s not going to produce a high. Longer term/chronic usage could result in a variety of side effects including weight changes, tardive dyskinesia, GI effects, akathesia, and could also increase your risk of diabetes.
If you’re taking an AP as an adjunctive to your antidepressant, it’s expected to increase the antidepressant effect and to get you all the way to well. However, there are still the potential for the side effects above, but they can be managed, and in my mind, it’s worth it if you’re living your life to the fullest again!",schizophrenia
1259,"These medicines are to correct alteration in brain chemicals and keep them in check. These medicines artificially prevent release of the chemicals which have gotten in excess before limiting their increase over a period of time. Without the prescription of a Doctor, it is better to avoid taking these medicines. Because these medicines are not easy to take. Like normal paracetamol for fever, these medicines often come with consequences which even Doctors are not comfortable discussing. They say live with it, unless you get used to taking medicines. In my case, those consequences was Vomiting( Doctor denied of any such consequence). Then next was irritation and some kind of anxiety in chest and abnormal heart beating. Besides these medicines are known to decrease sexual libido. Doctors often don’t mention these consequences to the Patient. So in case you don’t need taking these medicines because you have not been diagnosed with such condition. Please avoid taking them. And it’s not just months, you have to take these medicines for years. I have been taking these medicines for one and half year, despite the fact that my health has improved a lot. Where I Al no longer Schizophrenic. But for a period of 6–9 months or maybe more, I would be prescribed them for precautionary purposes for the fear of relapse again. So, upto you to decide.",schizophrenia
1260,"Antipsychotics can improve the effectiveness of other psychiatric meds. I take Seroquel (along with tegretol) because it helps reduce the number of manic episodes I have with my bipolar disorder. A few side effects, mainly weight gain — but no serious manic episodes since I started it. You can’t imagine how wonderful this is for someone with serious BP type 1. Believe me, I could live with a lot more side effects just to have this relief. Remember, side effects vary from person to person, you have to measure the good results against the bad. If side effects are too nasty, get your doctor to change medications. This is why you need a well-trained psychiatrist monitoring you. And keep the doctor informed!!!",schizophrenia
1261,"Antipsychotics are used for things that are not technically “psychosis.”
I take Seroquel for Bipolar. It helps with dissociation, disorganized and delusional thinking. When I first started taking Seroquel, my husband and I noticed an almost immediate improvement in the clarity of my thought processes. Many people, myself included also take a small dose in the evening for the added benefit of helping to prevent insomnia.

1262,"My mom had Schizophrenia. In spite of her illness, she was by no means irresponsible. She cooked for us every day, cleaned the house, took care of the whole family (my father was a banker, my brother was 16 and I was 6). She seemed like any other Indian housewife doing her chores, until she started talking about how someone was plotting to kill her. She would hallucinate relentlessly about being abducted by two men (an imaginary doctor and his friend), and would mutter things to herself. She would always tell us that the two men were spying on her, and would abduct and kill her if she stepped out of the house. For this reason, she rarely got out of the house; I remember pleading her to go to the parents' meet with me at our school. She just wouldn't budge. I remember having to go to the meet with a kind neighbour, as my dad was at work. She would also 'hear' the two men having sinister conversations about her. Given my age, I was the only person who believed in every word she spoke; I was convinced that two evil men were trying to hurt my mother. So, I was always on the lookout for suspicious looking men near our house, and had this heartfelt urge to protect her.
The illness actually runs in my mom's family. Her mother and sister had spells of schizophrenia, but they weren’t as serious as my mother's. My father took her to a couple of psychiatrists, but for some reason, she hated taking the medication they prescribed and would just 'cheek' the pills, spitting them right out when no one was looking. Every day, we would find at least two semi-dissolved pills either on the floor, or in the backyard. She even underwent ECT on the advice of a doctor, but it was of no use. After every ECT session, she would return home and mute herself out for the next few days. Sometimes she would just stare flatly at the food on her plate without touching it. I can only imagine the suffering she went through, because she strongly believed that someone was out there to get her, and lived in constant fear. Many a times, she would burst into tears out of the blue, and I had no idea how to react to her pain. I remember feeling strange about the situation, as I was too young to comprehend what her suffering meant. I remember my brother (who was a teenager then) inspecting her mouth to see if she hid any pills under her tongue, and she was often caught cheeking. She would laugh it off, but her behavior was quite confusing to me as to why my otherwise responsible mom would show childlike defiance when it came to taking her medication. But amidst all the psychological suffering she had been going through, she never neglected me, and nurtured me to the best of her abilities. I remember her helping me with my homework, dressing me up for costume parties, and massaging my tiny feet when I was down with flu. But there were times when she would lose it altogether; She once caught my brother by his throat, when he declined to take her to my father's office, which was several miles away. She wanted to stay at my father’s office, as it felt safer to her than our home. Having to see your 16 year old big brother cry like a baby, breaks something inside you.
Her symptoms began when she was 33 years old, and worsened by the time she was 36. But whenever someone visited us, she put on a pleasant exterior and wore a warm smile. Around that time, she started planning for my 7th birthday, went to the mall with my dad (which was surprising because she rarely stepped out of the house) and picked a pretty pink birthday dress for me. She invited our relatives, neighbours and my classmates to the birthday party and cooked delicious meals for the occasion. Thanks to her, my 7th birthday party was a bomb. And then a day later she did the unthinkable - she committed suicide by setting herself on fire.
Having to see my mum engulfed in a raging fire did not invoke any kind of reaction in me initially. I was in a state of shock, yes, but I was in huge denial. I just could not wrap my head around the fact that the human torch trudging in the backyard, being consumed by a blazing fire from head to toe, was none other than my mother. I saw my father lose his mind over the sight, letting out heart-wrenching screams of horror, and trying to put off the flames with whatever he could lay his hands on. And then I remember the neighbours pitching in to stop the flames somehow. She was then rushed to the hospital with 80 percent of her body burnt, where she was declared dead the next day, at the age of 36. My mom, my blood, my love… was gone, turning my life upside down.
I am a 27 year old woman now, and even today when my mom visits me in my dreams, she never looks happy. She is always covered in burns and scars , and always carries the look of sorrow on her face. And I sometimes wonder if I would ever be afflicted with schizophrenia, since it is genetic. I have never experienced anything like it till now, but the future as they say, is unpredictable, or in my case, predictable to some extent (Research says children of schizophrenic moms have 10–15 percent risk of developing Schizophrenia). I just wish more medical research goes into mental disorders, since I have witnessed how the mental illness of a family member can have debilitating psychological effects on other members of the family, especially the children. Even though we are doing well in our respective careers, my brother and I have our fair share of psychological issues to deal with; my brother is hypochondriac and is currently on medication, while I dealt with depression in the past and have anxiety issues as of now. This is like a never-ending cycle and I really hope it ends one day. Even to this day, it pains me that for no fault of hers, my mom had to meet with such a tragic end.
A heart-wrenchingly tragic end.
Love you, Mom. If death had seemed like the only escape to you, so be it.",schizophrenia
1263,"I've been living with my schizophrenic mother for more than 4 years. That’s when she started her “weird behaviour “. At first when she said that our relatives threatened her on phone I believed her. It was not quite right but why would she lie about it? I continued to believe everything she said until she wanted me to believe there were cameras installed in every corner of our house. That’s when I realized she's “just very paranoid “. Still took me a long time to figure out she's schizopheric. First two years of her illness were very hard for all of my family. She'd just constantly cry about being spyed and not being able to do anything about it. She was also having body ache problems at that time. She couldn't walk properly. Her legs and back gave up on her easily. I , 14 at that time was sympthatic ,angry, confused ,scared everything. During the first 2 years she wasn't able eat even .
She was fully convinced that I and my then 17 sister are being raped and sexually abused almost everywhere we go. No matter it's school or a relative house or even our own. She “saw” one of my aunts coming to our house every night to make pornos of her and her daughters. Every morning I woke up to see either her crying or my father trying to convince her that no one's spying on her or the worst she directly looking at me when I open my eyes and first thing i hear in the morning would be “She (my aunt) was here last night. I saw her doing something to you . I'm sorry i couldn't save you” Then she'd just burst into tears. I was scared of her sometimes. The way she talked and trusted no one it made me so angry at her and i would scream at her “Why can't you just trust us? “ Those two years were the most dramatic period of my life. I'd come back from school to find her either standing at the door impatiently waiting for me or crying in her bed. I started hating her. I hated being around her. She often used to grab me and my sister and tell us how much she loves us and how we can share everything with her and she wants to know why my sister was making sex noises last night. She'd even suggest coming to my school and asking the teachers if someone comes to meet me there or threaten me or if I'm being harassed. I felt embarrassed I cried zillions of time because of her. She was paranoid about her children and didn'ttrust anyone.
Then after two years when her body started functioning properly she became a normal mother. She used to make food , go for shopping, clean the house everything that a normal housewife does. But her thoughts were still stuff there. She still thinks my sister was raped on her 18th birthday. She still thinks our pornos are surfing all over the Internet. I started hating her with all my heart. I felt like she was ruining our lives. I hated how she blamed my father for everything that he didn't even do. I hated that I had to see my father cry several times. He loved her so much . And no matter what he said she believed with all her heart that he shared their bedroom stories with people. That he secretly married some 20 year old girl at my mother's brother's funeral.
She's still like this. Now my sister and I live in different hostels and visit once a month. Everytime we come home same questions are bombarded at us and she just starts crying out of nowhere. I don't even know what to do anymore. Whenever she calls any one of us she keeps on asking if there's something we wanna tell her if we are worried about anything if there's someone who's threating us if we're being sexually harassed “again”.
I try to tell myself that it's not her fault and she's not well but i can't help hating her. It's so frustrating all these years seeing other kids with normal moms wishing you had one too. Even with all the medications it seems like it's never gonna go away. So I've accepted that it's not a phase and it's gonna be with me all my life.
I thought i don't care about her now but just as i was reading another answer to this question telling about how schizophrenic mother committed suicide I thought about my mother doing that and realized no matter what i need her in my life. I still love her. I don't want her to do anything like that.
It's just that i wish she was normal i wish i didn't have to go through all this maybe I'm being selfish but I feel better when I'm away from her and home . Away from all the constant questioning and paranoid thoughts and crying and the depressing environment but i feel sorry for my father that he has to face all this alone . I love him more than anything else in the world and hate that i can't help him in any way.
In short, having a schizophrenic parent fucks your life up.",schizophrenia
1264,"At first you dont think anything is wrong with them.
Then as you start to get older your mentally well parent has to explain why the police and the ambulance has taken your parent away.
You do not understand.
All you know is your parent has been taken away and you do not like this one bit.
As you get older you pick up on other family members talking about “her nerves again?”
You worrk out the code and ask but get a watered-down version of the situation, you think ok i got this.
You don't got this.
You get to visit them in hospital.
If you have a child with a schizophrenic partner DO NOT TAKE THEM TO VISIT THEIR PARENT AT A PSYCHIATRIC WARD.
Especially if its a locked ward….
No good will come of this…..
Seeing your parent desperately trying to keep their shit together and smiling like everything is ok is NOT OK for a kid.
As you get older you see the hospitalisation pattern developing.
Meds work
Meds make them tired
Dose gets reduced
They get better than better
They get manic
They dont sleep
They cant keep their shit together and tell you all the absurd and sometimes scary stuff they feel is/has/will happen because you are their child and they trust you.
You're on the good guy list.
Not like your other parent or the doctor who just want to keep them drugged up and locked away.
You'd never betray them……..
Then usually they'd find themselves in some sort of trouble with the law, concerned neighbours or psychiatric nurses who were no longer fooled by the act.
And they get sectioned again.
By this point you know the drill.
At some point their illness becomes a burden, teenage years to early 20's
You can't stand their “the meds make me tired” bullshit.
You resent not having a normal childhood

Am i going to let my child have their reality distorted by the absolute nonsense i endured?
NO WAY",schizophrenia
1265,"My mother got diagnosed as a bi-polar, then as a schizophrenic while I was in my last high school years.
The best way I can explain it is that it's comparable to running through a unending and self-repeating gauntlet of emotions every day of your life: confusion, fear, sadness, disgust, shame, pity and self-pity, anger, envy, indignation, tolerance, patience, surprise, appreciation, hope, and then back to fear again.

Confusion:
How would you feel if you and your younger sister came home in 2008 to your mom telling you she’s on Obama’s head team, and that since she's been on this team the FBI and CIA have been following her everywhere (while residing in Canada)? How would you feel the next day when you walk in on her treating the living room as if it was bugged, asking her what's wrong, and being led to her bedroom and she quietly telling you that the people in the TV were watching and listening to her every move? Now, how would you feel if the day after that you came home and found that she had packed all her clothes in suitcases because Obama was apparently sending his men to pick her up that night?
Yeah, confused is the gist of it. So you do what anybody would do, and take her to the hospital to figure out what's wrong.
Fear:
The first thing you feel when the doctors (and eventually psychiatrists) tell you that your mom is a schizophrenic is a slow build-up of fear. They give you booklets of information on schizophrenia on your way back home which all-in-all tell you that ""this thing that happening to your mom, yeah, sorry - it's incurable, but you can adjust."" That's when that slow-build up picks up speed. You realize that your life is never going to be the same again. That you can no longer depend on your mom (the only parent you have at this point) to raise you, and that you have to raise not only yourself but also the person who is supposed to be raising you. That... &., &., &..
Sadness:
Once fear has had it's way with you, sadness creeps in. You stop thinking about yourself for a minute and realize that your mom can never have a normal life again, that she's either going to be on pills for the rest of her life, or end up the homeless lady yelling obscenities to the local kids from the corner if you don't take care of her. You realize that, it's less noticeable than a missing arm or leg but, she is in fact disabled now.
Disgust:
After having gone through fear and sadness, and after living with her in the worst moments of her condition for a bit you develop disgust. You can't help it. She neglects showering to the point where you have to do it for her. She neglects eating at times, and wearing clothes. (Ever walked in on your parents naked? Multiply that by a thousand.) And most of all, she backslides back to all childish emotions and habits (she doesn't do anything while thinking of the other). For example, she'll spend rent money on chocolate, booze, massages, or any short-lived pleasure she comes across first (and like a child doing something she knows she's not supposed to, she lies and hides that she does this), she'll put something in the oven, walk away lost in her thoughts, and you realize about four hours later that something smells burnt and that maybe you should check the oven this time, again, to make sure the house doesn't burn down. It all eventually gets to the point where disgust wears down into extreme annoyance. But this is all home-life, life outside of the public eye. In public you feel shame, pity, and self-pity.
Shame/Pity/Self-pity/Anger/Envy/Indignation:
You start feeling ashamed of who your mom is in people's eyes, the crazy lady. Walking in public with her becomes a mental exercise in hoping, and praying, and pleading to a god you don't believe in, asking that he make sure that she doesn't do anything to embarrass you this time, just this one time. And this too eventually wears you down to the point where you're never seen in public with her unless you absolutely must.
Ashamed is how you feel when, in another of her episodic fits, you call the cops to help you take her to the local mental hospital/ward, and you notice that the cops know you or know of you.
Then your friends and family hear the news, ""I heard about your mom, I'm really sorry, I can't imagine what you're going through, you and your sister are strong kids, &. ,&., &.,""... and after enough of this you realize something, they pity you. Wait, those cops pitied you too! And why shouldn't they? You've just grown up faster than you planned, you've just lost your childhood. You've just lost a childhood which all your friends are still experiencing right in front of your eyes. And what's worse is that they're enjoying a childhood you've just lost while looking at you with eyes of pity. That's when pity starts to make way for full blown anger, envy, and indignation. Everyone you see your age and happy becomes a beacon of light pointing to the one thing you desperately want and can't have, young abandonment. A month, a week, a day where you have no worries. A day where you can live life like every normal teenager who doesn't have to worry about bills or putting food on the table. Or better yet, a day where you don't have to sleep half-awake with your door open just in case your mom decides to leave the house running again at 4 AM in a fit of paranoia. Everyone becomes a beacon of how life's just not fair.
And let me tell you, that feeling holds onto you for so, so long. But somehow, in that same breath and sentence, you realize something quiet profound in it's simplicity- life's not fair.
Tolerance/Patience:
Yeah, life's not fair, but not just for you. There are people all over the world starving unjustly. There are animals and plants dying under hands that could care less about them. There are kids who wish, and plead, and pray to a god that's long forgotten to answer back asking for him to let the worst of their worries tonight be that their mother or father went out at 4 AM, but please, not in there rooms, not in their beds, not tonight.
And when you fully realize just how unfair life is, a schizophrenic mom starts to look less like someone's out to get you, and more like, well, life. You start to not only tolerate her strange habits, but accept them. And you start looking on the positive side of everything in the same manner, such as how you growing up faster is in fact an advantage; you've learnt how to handle money, time, and sleep a lot better than people twice your age, yes - it was hard, but how is that not a positive?
Surprise/Appreciation:
And in looking at the positive side, you realize that your mom being schizophrenic and you being male and an artist is very much linked. You realize that this gift of thinking differently, of feeling emotions just a little more sensitively than the next guy over, of seeing patterns where others don't see it, and of writing is a gift from her genes. You realize that your shunning of sports to read books because you got so happily lost in the worlds they provided is most likely because of her genes. And you realize that all those childhood signs of her developing paranoid schizophrenia, of her keeping you and your sister in the house and away from untold dangers by being overly protective in fact helped you nurture those creative gifts that her genes gave you in the first place. And every day you find something she wrote poetically in a trace, or talk to her in her fits of sanity you can't help but be surprised at her talents and in some sense appreciative of this mental condition.
Hope/Fear:
All this leading to hope. Hope that your mom can overpower this condition like some people have and use it for good instead of it overpowering her. Hope that these genes that rubbed off on you, the child of a schizophrenic, don't grow and develop into their own form of schizophrenia but stay in you, in low quantities, where they can do more good than harm (children and grandchildren of schizophrenics are more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia). Hope that, similar to growing up too fast, this whole journey with your schizophrenic mom, yourself, and your sister, is hard now, but later a gift you can look back on.
But in all that hope, you can't help but hear that little familiar voice in your head; that one that starts the gauntlet of emotions running all over again, that fearful one that whispers, ""What if tomorrow's the day you can't handle it all? What if this all gets worse not better? What if she gets worse not better? What if what's holding onto her so tightly sets its beady little eyes on you and your sister next? What if...""",schizophrenia
1266,"Shes just ""not there"", shes here in the flesh but we lost her a long time ago.
It took over and she was just... gone.
She's alive today, her paranoid attacks stopped but she's ""not there"", just empty and hallow, she doesnt speak, she doesnt interact or make facials expressions. She cant work.
In the early years, My father blamed it on stress, but I knew it wasn't normal.
Due to our culture, they did not believe in mental illness. My family was more superstitious and believed in demonic possession, most of my family believed my mother ""unfortunately"" became possessed and needed an exorcism. She was not medically diagnosed until I was 18 years old; when I persuaded my father to take her to a psychiatrist and he reached out to her out of state family who were less superstitious and believed in medicine and psychological illness.
What me and my sister experienced growing up:
As a person my mother was a very strong, assertive, stubborn and a narrow minded woman, the schizo made it ten times worse.
She believed in ""tough love"", which is fine but there is a line and when this line is crossed it borders into abuse. And the line was crossed many times.
-Overly Paranoid
-Someone is watching and following her
-Extremely Delusional
-Extreme Beliefs/Views/Actions
-Verbally Emotionally Mentally abusive to me, my sister & father.
-Competitive/ Power struggles with me and my father.
-Everyone is an enemy, Everyone is out to get her and her family
-""Beware of everyone, dont have friends, dont get to close to people""
-She cut off mine and my sisters healthy connection to our family, cousins and friends and tried to isolate us the same way she did to herself.
-She believed everything was bugged, that she & her family were being watched from every corner of the house or the supermarket or in public...
-She would whisper things like others could hear and wouldn't let us say certain words or speak about things in detail. ""SSSsshhh""
She would regularly tear through my room and throw things away as she pleased, especially things I collected. If I ever started a collection or showed love for something she would get rid of it. Every time my friends gave gifts, she would say ""no such things as friends"" and would wait till I left the house to throw away any gifts I received.
If I tried to hide anything she would dig until she found it.
At 12 I was mostly confused and was unaware
that I was suffering emotional and mental abuse. I never said anything or attacked her, I truly felt bad for my mother.
13 years I became very depressed. It felt very unfair.
Nothing made sense. I did not get to have a daughter relationship with my mother like all my friends whose families were healthy and supportive. My mother loved us of course, but the way she expressed it was wrong.
14 years I was getting fed up. I lashed back and confronted her.
I started developing as my own person, strong willed, adventurous, opinionated and resilient. I was a strong believer in ""the right way"", discipline, positivity and my health.
When I found myself becoming similarly paranoid, I felt the best thing to do was pull away and avoid her, I tried to ignore her because when I thought too much about her crazy behavior or tried to make sense of it I felt like I myself, was going crazy or insane.
I had to be very strong in order to reject her influence. I decided I would not let myself become overly mistrustful, hateful, hurtful & negative like her. It was unfair but I tried to rise above my resentment and anger.
As I grew older through my high school years I tried multiple methods of communication and approaches to get through to her, nothing; the only thing that worked sadly, was conditioning. Conditioning her to not destroy my things.
15 years After her second paranoid schizophrenia attack at :
-She covered all the furniture in the house with plastic
-Only ate with plastic utensils
-Put black tape on all the power buttons of tvs, computers and all electronics
-Pointed randomly in the air during conversation saying ""thats where He is, He hears everything we say"".
- She often sat extremely still and silent staring off
for exactly 4 hours one time.
-She started talking less and when she did talk it was gibberish.
I was emotionally strong and mentally resilient enough to endure & eventually develop the tools that helped me cope and continue to grow as my person in the midst of an aggressive schizophrenic.
I took most of the heat, she was not hostile to my younger sister for some reason, I was seen as the ""threatening opposer"".
Today, she doesn't go anywhere at all, she doesnt talk or conversate, is extremely skinny, awkward, extremely anxious, and she doesn't eat or interact when me and my sister take her out.
No one but another who grew up with a abusive schizophrenic will understand how much will, self awareness and mental strength it took to be able to grow into a confident, emotionally stable & healthy individual. I refuse to play victim or be a abuser myself.
Shes just not there, shes here in the flesh but we lost her a long time ago.",schizophrenia
1267,"My mother is a schizophrenic patient. My age at that time was 8–9 year’s old, the exact last year my grandma died. One afternoon in the month of march my mom said to me and my brother that ‘someone is coming to kill us and we should leave now’.
Firstly i belived her and she take us (me and my brother) to our restaurant!!( My father have a small restaurant). By every passing day i can see the change in her nature and behaviour. I was scared as hell.
Suddenly she started abusing my relatives and my neighbours….
She shout like some kind of speaker is fitted in her mouth. She say very abusive words about my father,relatives,neighbours!
My neighbour aunties stopped their children to play with me and my brother.whenever i go to my home or somewhere else my friends standing in their gate close the doors by seeing me coming. No one talk to me and neighbourhood aunties do gossip that there is some black magic in our home and my mother is possessed with some kind of bad soul!😶
I oftenly go to school because my parents were fighting 24/7!!
My mother don’t cook food for us and we have our lunchboxes empty everytime…
Every night my parents beat each other badly and i just used to cry, instead of crying i can’t do anything!!
My mother spents a lot of money actually she waste money on some stupid stuff. Once she has torred money(notes) and throw them in the sewer.
She throw ink into her clothes and became a monster!!😢
Everyone think that my mother is a mad lady and i agree with it!!
After 3yrs of her disease she was finally admitted to a mental hospital and she was cured.
But after three years in (2020) she again started all her stupid dramas…
The thing is my life is like some serial or some kind of joke!!
Still i can’t do anything, if i’ll try to do something or stop her she will definetly bash me.
I don’t know what is going to happen in coming days,months and years!!
But i don’t want her to die… whatever she is but first she my own mother.
I am 14yrs old and my mind is blown😑
She just shouts 24hrs, sometimes she cries and sometimes she laughs but both without any f***ing reason!!
You’ll judge me because now i started hating my own mother.
Living with a schizophrenic parent is something that you can’t explain in words. My whole childhood is ruined but i expect a better future.
Peace💛",schizophrenia
1268,"Thank you for asking this.
I grew up with a schizophrenic mother, she apparently started showing signs of this when she was in her late teens. I have two older brothers, they are eleven and thirteen years older, our Dad left home when I was born and my brothers left home when I was about eight. The truth is that my Dad was trying to leave my mother and then she tried to keep him there by getting pregnant with me, it didn't work he left anyway, probably for his own self preservation , my brothers left as soon as they were able to, again for their own survival I guess? So I was left to live with her from that age. She suffered from paranoid schizophrenia with Bi Polar thrown in. Let me just use a few words to describe my experience simply, it was confusing, frustrating, terrifying, anger inducing, sad, depressing, lonely, extremely stressful,made me feel different to everyone else, we were poverty stricken, without food and electricity (pre paid electricity meter, no money = no electricity) sometimes, I was neglected emotionally, lack of food, not really any proper conversation, no care given to me, I wasn't given life skills by my mother, I was a sort of parent to her,I couldn't have a proper relationship with her, having conversations with her is a little bit like talking to a pull cord doll or pre programed machine, she asks the same questions again and again every time I see her, either that or isn't speaking at all, it's almost like the person that she was isn't really there, she is really just what is left after being ravaged by this illness, the effect on my brain was that it went into a sort of survival mode where the focus becomes not about thriving but surviving, of course then when at school everything that you are being taught seems completely irrelevant, how can maths or history etc help me?
I was looked after by other relatives for six week periods while she was in psychiatric hospital, she was on medication, quite primitive though it was at the time, I think more of an elephant strength sedative than a real anti psychotic, she was also having ECT, I think weekly.
She would very rarely be what I would call normal, she was on a constant journey between very high and very low and visa versa, very briefly passed through a phase of being normal-ish for a few days maybe, I can't really remember how long to be honest. when she was high she was a bit out of touch with reality, completely care free, spending money she didn't have,dressing in ridiculous clothes, not really caring about anything, including me, and when she was low she wouldn't really be speaking and communicating, this is when it was really terrible, this was when it was truly dark and scary, she would hear voices and have delusions* that people were plotting to kill her, she would ring the police, they would turn up en masse expecting a murder! Obviously as I got older I was able to distinguish between what was real and what wasn't as far as her delusions were concerned, luckily my brothers were around for my very early years, if they hadn't been and it had just been me and my mother I think I would have had a good chance of ending up insane! Also developing a black sense of humour about it also helped, sometimes no matter how bad things are you just have to laugh at things.
This was in the 1970s and 80s, things have improved as far as the treatment and anti psychotic medication for schizophrenia goes, well certainly in her case, once she started having anti psychotic injections regularly she definitely became more stable.
I'm sorry I can't really think of one positive of this illness, her life has been extremely difficult and I feel desperately sorry for her and her lost life, at the same time I can't stand being around her or hearing her voice, even the sight of her face isn't very pleasant to me, I do speak to her on the phone every week and visit her when I'm back where I grew up but my brain is screaming at me to get out of the situation when I'm with her, I understand as I always have that it's not her fault but I can't help the effect that she's had on me, without doubt there are consequences of my early life that are just with me and part of me and will always be.
There were many many suicide attempts over the years and the final one while I was living with her I remember very vividly, it was really quite haunting, I was 17 and she had just been released from psychiatric hospital, I had gone out for the day and I arrived home just as it was getting dark, the doors were locked and there was no answer but I could just make out by looking through the window that she was lay on the sofa, sort of half on and half off, I knew that she had tried d to take her own life again (tablets) I remember thinking, “I hope she's done it this time”, she hadn't but shortly after this she was taken into care and I was left to live on my own.
Thanks for reading
*Her delusions were quite often sinister, she had a fixation that the son of the neighbour was plotting to kill her, she would quite often be telling me to keep my voice down because people were listening.
When she was very ill she would generally stay in bed during the day and be awake at night, the really terrifying thing for me was being woken up in the night being told things like: ‘there are people in the Garden trying to break into the house to kill us’ or that my aunt that had died was in her bedroom, and she'd been talking to her.",schizophrenia
1269,"I lived in a single parent household, with my mother who had schizoaffective disorder and one sibling. Her brother that lived nearby and was a father figure had paranoid schizophrenia. I do not know my father.
As a young child, I found it confusing.
I found it very difficult to understand the difference between right and wrong, the difference between delusion and lying, the difference between delusion and reality.
For example, one instance when my mother was committed, she told me that the nurse was poisoning her and I needed to help her escape. So, obviously, we attacked the nurse.
Afterwards, it was difficult to understand that even though I was protecting my mother, attacking the nurse was the ‘wrong’ thing to do. I struggled to understand that, while it is ‘bad’ to lie, my mother was not lying because she believed it to be true. Also, because someone believes something to be true, does not make it true.
My uncle had a reoccurring delusion that certain people were imposters at different times. I also found this to be very confusing when I was young. I did not know who to believe or trust, or what was the ‘right’ thing to do.
I was also popular at school, but did not understand why parents kept telling their children (ie. my class mates, friends, etc.) to not talk to or play with me. I was not invited to birthday parties, or to my friend’s houses to play on weekends. I did not understand why parents did not like me.
It was also eventful.
I never knew what was going to happen. For example, I never knew who would pick us up from school. Maybe my mother, my uncle, another relative, a case worker that I might already know or a new one, or no one. At very short notice I may be sleeping at home, at my uncle’s, at another relatives, at the hospital or in crisis care.
If I had to find my mother around the house, she could be in the kitchen cooking, in the living room watching TV, hanging in the bedroom closet, or outside up a tree helping a cat that she was hallucinating was stuck.
My uncle would often hallucinate bomb threats on the radio. Sometimes he would crash through the window in the middle of the night, bundle up my sibling and I from our beds, throw us each over his shoulder and run down the street screaming.
We would often have big parties and family dinners at home. In reality there would only be three or four of us, but my mother and uncle would frequently hallucinate other people/fairies/creatures. It was fun for my sibling and I to pretend to see them too and play along.
Sometimes we would go on adventures, cracking codes, scavenger hunts, stealing things, playing hide and seek with people that may or may not have been real. Certainly, if they were real, they would not have known they were playing.
As I grew older, I found that it was useful.
I realized that other people felt sorry for me, and that my mother felt very guilty. I could use that to my advantage, or as an excuse to get out of trouble for poor behavior. I could also use the threat of my uncle especially to encourage my peers to do things for me.
However, during my teenage years I realized that if I proved to the case workers that I could look after myself, my sibling, the house, and keep up with school, I would not have to live in care while my mother was hospitalized. Later, while my peers rebelled, I was absolutely motivated to stay out of significant trouble, but had a convenient excuse when I slipped.
I am aware that some people do not have a pleasant childhood when their parent that suffers from schizophrenia. I, however, not only have many very fond memories of being able to do and see things that most other children would not have been exposed to, but believe some very positive aspects of my personality were borne from those experiences.
For instance, I am now very flexible and adaptable. I rarely worry. I am also self-confident and resilient. I know that I can handle situations that most people cannot, that I can figure and get out of situations that most people cannot, that I can stay positive and see the good in situations when most people cannot. I believe my confidence stems from the fact that I never once doubted whether or not I was loved, or whether I had support. I always knew that my mother and uncle would fight and die to protect my sibling and me.
I will say that paranoia and suspicion of others is deeply ingrained in me because of my experience growing up with a schizophrenic parent, but I do not see this is a bad thing.",schizophrenia
1270,"Oh wow! I can't believe after all these years, I am going to get into this but I think that it's about time that should.
My father was paranoid schizophrenic. He was diagnosed sometime after WWll; he was Jewish and fought on the Czechoslovakian resistance. His first wife and their 3 children were killed in Auschwitz, as was my dad's mother. He had two sisters who were also taken to Auschwitz, but they too survived. My father and his two sisters left Europe after the war and settled in Montreal, which is where my dad met my mother. My mother said that when they first started dating my father had odd behavior, so prior to their marriage my mother had him seek help. It was then that he was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. The doctor told them that without medication, his mental illness would progress as years went by. The doctor was correct. Medication would've helped him, but It was hard to get him to take it. He would start taking it, but eventually he'd go into a “spell” and think someone was trying to kill him, then he'd flush the medicine down the toilet.
As for these ""spells""...well this is what we lived with...
As far back as I can remember, there were fights between my mom and dad. These were not just run of the mill arguments and bickering ...this was fighting with all the bells and whistles; there were objects flying, mom crying, bruises appearing, screaming obscenities and far-fetched accusations. These fights usually stemmed from some wild suspicions that my dad had thinking my mom was meeting up with men in the middle of the night. He'd back his claims with ridiculous ideas; like there was a huge dent in the bush that was in front of our kitchen window, this is where dad said the milkman must've been sitting and hiding. He would call me out there to show me, saying ""Pati look, you see where the man was sitting in the bush watching inside our house?"" When I was around 5 years old, I didn't really care to hear a story about men sitting in our bushes watching us, whether it was true or not.
Around these years my dad started marking off sections in the fridge, with black electrical tape. In his little marked off area he would put his foods; his jars of pickled herring, gelfite fish, pickled cabbage and matzo ball soups. He would mark the lids on the jars, or seal them a certain way so he knew they weren't being tampered with. We were not to touch the food in his section of the fridge. Wait let me correct that, my mother, and my brother and sister who were twins, were not allowed to touch his section. But me; for some reason dad formed a favoritism thing with me. I was the youngest and when he'd go into these “spells"" he would only trust me. He would call me over to him as he sat in his little fortress on the couch; we had a set of 4 really high backed chairs and dad found those chairs to work quite nicely as a barricade placed around the couch. He would stack things like photo albums and books onto the chairs, not as a way to make them immoveable, but to cause a huge noise if someone tried to get to him. His idea was the noise would wake him up in time if somebody came after him. Under the couch cushion, he would have his artillery; he had various kitchen knives, and an antique-sheathed long knife of some sort that he had. If my mom got to them first and hid the knives, a hammer and some long screwdrivers would be among the items we would quietly put away when we realized his “spell” was over. We never brought it up to dad after he snapped out of it, because we didn't want to spark him back to another episode.
I don't think I've even scratched the surface of how bizarre he got during these episodes. Physically we were able to see them come on because dad's eyes would get a sort of glassy look to them, and then the face scowl would follow shortly after followed by the obscenities and strange ranting. He had a certain repertoire of things he would scream out repeatedly. But it wasn't always in the same order, like a rehearsed spiel. It was just these phrases, that he used over and over...there was some curse phrases in Czech that he'd say, but also he'd say things like; [he had a very strong Czech accent which will be apparent, as you read the way I write these]
“NAH! These Christians! These Christians so good are they! They try to cut me up in little pieces, I tell you something mister man, they think they're smart, they think they big like elephant but they are small like mosquito! The Christians! NAH! The president, your president! NAH! You call them Christians?! They will cut me up and eat my skin! Pati, Pati come here Pati, your mother is trying to kill me Pati, call the police Pati please”
…at this point my mom would chime in;
MOM: “Pati go to bed, don't you touch that phone.”
DAD: “Pati, stay right here, don't listen to her Pati, you are different Pati stay away from your crazy, drunkard, mother, and don't trust the two of them, [He was referring to my brother and sister who were twins, one year older than me] they are like her, if she tells them to kill me, they will listen! ...”
…then the wild rants continued, not addressed to anyone, just screaming 'NAH! I tell you something you will never know! The dirty, rotten pigs, they think they are smart, they are filthy and stupid like fly! NAH! Dirty rotten pig whores! The cops, where is the cops! They are your Christians! Like your mother, your father...call them I will spit on them! [Sometimes followed by actual spitting!]...They take my clothes and cut me with knives, NAH! So smart they are! They take my mother and cook her for their dinner! They fill up there stomachs with my flesh, my family…my family is gone! My family is inside the stomachs of the Christians, like animals they eat!”
....Oh there was more, so much more! I think I could go on for ever, reciting the phrases I grew up hearing. It was always a difficult situation when a friend would want to stay the night. Even when he was in a decent mood when we arranged it, we would never want our friends to encounter him in one of these moods.
Especially as things started getting worse…by this time the moods were coming more frequent, and lasting a lot longer. My mom would take it out on me that my father would only trust and talk to me. My brother and sister too, were not happy hearing dad say “Pati you're the only one I trust here, you're the only one I love.” They would gang up on me and blame me that he only loved me. His episodes still consisted of the ranting like a lunatic and couch barricades...but now even more fun starts! One day amidst his ranting, we hear a commotion in the hallway, and here comes dad running towards us down the hall, wearing only his underwear and yielding a bow and arrow. There was another incident that the neighbor next door called us on phone and said dad was laying spread eagle on the top of the car in the driveway, dressed in only get this, his underwear. We got him down off the roof of the car, and here we go thru another spell of lunacy.
I asked my mom, numerous times growing up, why didn't she just divorce him. Her response was always “because he is sick, Pati, he doesn't know what he is doing. And GOD said forgive those who know not what they do.” That made my mom look so weak to me; well between that, and the numerous suicide attempts on her part. I caught on to the 'feel sorry for me aspect' after the 2nd time she attempted it.
Mom and dad divorced when I was 14. I didn't care if they were split up, and didn't care about the situation at all. My mom ended up getting most of everything. After selling the house, she got the three kids and almost all of the belongings. Dad moved to a very small studio apartment and his health slowly deteriorated along with his mind. His heart problems eventually took his life in December of 1989, and his suffering finally ended.
He was 77 years old, and had been laying in a coma for 3 months. We'd go visit him and tell him 'fight dad, you gotta fight' but, eventually his kidneys began to fail, and organs were bleeding, we had to make a choice. On December 14, 1989 I read my dad the story in the paper about his country being freed from communism. I told him he didn't need to fight anymore, his country was a free country and he could go back there. We decided not to make the decision to pull the plug until morning, and we left the hospital. My dad died on his own that night! The doctor said he didn't think we'd even made it out of the building, and my dad passed away. I would like to think that his mind cleared in that split second, and all the scary thoughts went away...That even for just a minute he felt peace! And I'd like to believe he'd heard me, and went back to his beloved country, that he fought for and lost...just like his mind that he lost, I hope he got his peace. I loved that man, and I forgive him for my horrifying childhood...because God says to forgive those who know not what they do.",schizophrenia
1271,"Schizophrenia: What is it like growing up with a schizophrenic parent?
I contemplated answering this one a few times. I hesitated because I have a lot of gaps in my memory in relation to it.
My father has schizophrenia. As far as I know, he had it all through my life. The thing is while growing up I didn’t entirely understand that this is what was going on with him. I just thought he was who he was. On the medication, he was friendly, told funny stories, went to work, and lived a seemingly normal life.
The only instances I knew something wasn’t right was during the times he wouldn’t take his medication. Then he would be afraid of television commercials. He’d sometimes repeat phrases several times. He’d non-stop preach religion at me and my brother. And… the anger.
I recall a time when I was 7 or 8 when my family drove home from church. Something made him angry enough that he’d pull over the car and begin repeatedly punching the ceiling of the car above his head with his fist. Over and over. I sat behind him in the back seat watching this, thinking that all I wanted to do was open the car door and run down the road. But I was too afraid to move.
His anger was such that when I was 10, he would make me sort the clothes in my dresser again and again. If they weren’t folded and put away right, he’d take out the drawers and dump the clothes all over my bed, telling me to start again. One time I was so angry about this that I shouted “No!” at him. Big mistake. He slammed me against the wall, then took off his belt and hit me with it until I agreed to put the clothes away right.
When I was a teenager, my father would pick my brother and me up from school. Then he’d find a parking lot to pull off the road and begin his several-hour-long preaching sessions. All about sinners and how to prevent being a sinner. I used to internally panic, feeling self-conscious as other cars drove by. Wondering what they thought about us sitting in this empty parking lot. He did this so many times that I began zoning out. I mean, I seriously went someplace else in my head. I can’t describe the emotion I felt while that went on and I’m not certain what my brother did to get through it either. It’s so that now if someone starts lecturing at me, I automatically zone out.
When I was around age 12, my mother started telling me tales about my father. She used to say that sometimes he would become so angry that she had to hide my brother and me in a closet. She said that he used to run down the center of the street. And that he’d even run into a church with no clothes on. I don’t remember any of these things. I either blocked them out or they never happened.
When I was 16, he took me to the doctor to have me examined because he said he thought he had molested me. And he wanted to make sure he never had. That was so very embarrassing and I don’t know if my mother ever knew he took me for this exam, since they were divorced. He hadn’t, though he’d done other things like have me watch porn with him, but he hadn’t done anything enough that it showed on an exam. The doctor said I was fine. *so severely embarrassed*
I don’t know if that was because of the schizophrenia or something else. And it was difficult to know when to blame him for his behavior since he couldn’t always help it due to the illness.
My mother used his illness against me whenever I behaved in a way she didn’t like. If I ever was upset or what she called “exaggerating”, she’d say “you better be careful or you might end up sick like your father”. 😔
As a teenager, I researched everything I could on schizophrenia. Some books I read said that 50% of the children who had a schizophrenic parent would one day develop it themselves. There was my brother and there was me. Which one of us would get it? I was extremely paranoid within my own thoughts, always worried that if I thought too many strange things it might mean I would get it.
When I was 19, my brother began bringing me a book called Good Omens, saying that he wanted me to read it to him. He said that he thought it had a lot of truth in it, that it was very important. I’d thought it was a little odd since we were very close. People used to think we were twins even though there were a couple of years between us. So I read the book to him. His behavior started to change until one night he came to me in a panic. He was blowing air from his mouth like he was trying to blow something away from him. And he kept repeating “I’m disappearing… can you see me?”
My father and uncle were called and my brother was taken to a hospital where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. At age 17. That was one of the hardest days I experienced. It felt like I was falling down a continual pit that would never end.
Eventually, my parents and I were able to visit my brother in the hospital. I brought him a cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry shake every time I visited. It was so difficult to see him that way. He was… a different person. He’d ask me if the tree shadows on the neighboring building meant something.
During one visit I had to leave the room in order to cry in the hallway. A doctor came over to me and said a lot of encouraging and caring words to me. It was really the only time someone had stopped to even see me during that painful time. He thought I was the younger sister since I always looked younger than my age. I told him I was the older sister, that I was 19. He suddenly took everything back, changed his demeanor, and told me I needed to be strong for my brother. Then he walked away. 😞
Eventually, my brother came home, but not after several long months in the hospital, and a runaway attempt from the hospital where we had to go find him. He lives with my father now.
I know the question was about a schizophrenic parent, which I answered. But I have to quietly admit that sometimes I felt extremely angry at him. I feel like if he didn’t have schizophrenia, then my brother never would have had it either. I never developed it. I’m odd in other ways. Yet, even though so many years have passed by, deep down I still worry that one day it will creep up and envelop me. 💗
Thanks for the question. 😌",schizophrenia
1272,"Anger. Guilt. Shame.
I am 34 years old, and pregnant with my first child. It is my due date today. As I write this my mum is currently in hospital voluntarily to have her medication assessed, she rang me up today crying over the phone wanting me to visit her. I have refused as the hospital is 25 miles away but also I don't want the memory of this pregnancy to tie in with visiting my mum in the psych ward, I still have memories of visiting her in hospital on the first occasion she was sectioned, as a frightened six year old visiting her on new years day (she was finally sectioned when she took an overdose in front of me and my sister ) This is the second occasion in about 6 weeks that she has gone into hospital, although she has been gradually getting ill again for about 5 months.
She has been sectioned on 3 occasions that I know of- when I was aged 6,9,14 and these 2 voluntary treatments. That's not to say she has been well and stable all those moments in between.
She first became ill when I was 2 years old and my baby brother died- but was diagnosed as having a ‘mental breakdown’. Although to be honest I think it has always been there. When she was 14 she attempted suicide. Her illness was ignored for the 4 years prior to me turning 6.
Memories of some of her delusions include wife swappers, child sex abusers, child thieves, my dad trying to kill us, people wanting to chop our heads off, poison us, people having affairs, princes with aids etc etc. She was also emotionally abusive and neglectful and physically abusive and neglectful.
Life was generally chaotic. My dad was violent, both to my mum and my sister and I. He was also emotionally abusive and neglectful. They divorced when I was 11.
My maternal grandparents were a joke (still are) cold, distant, unloving, cruel, critical. They don't give a shit. Its all just too shameful and inconvenient for them. My mothers illness hasn't made them like this. Its innate in them.
My mum has always had to be in relationships, cannot cope without a man. Her second marriage was to an emotionally abusive financial leech and moron. She has had a number of boyfriends when she was much younger, to the detriment of my sister and I. My mum has rarely had a routine due to sleeping, depression, medication. She has had a few short term menial jobs but has not worked for around 20 years. She has had various eating disorders and has self harmed over the years. She cannot cope with real life.
Between the ages 11–14 she was ill and violent. This was again ignored. Violence consisted of being hit with belts, repeatedly punched in the face until I had lumps, poisoning my food with excessive amounts of salt and washing up liquid, pulling hair, when drying our hair hitting me over the head repeatedly with a hairbrush, burning my ears with the hair dryer, biting, punching, kicking, slapping. Telling me I was thick and bad. Throwing my clothes and toys away.
When I was 13 I went to live with my dad. My mother had locked us in the house. Refused to let us out. The police were called. For 2 years we had no contact with her (aged 13–15)
As a child I was frightened every day. Full of adrenaline. Confused. Not knowing what reality was. It was quite literally like alice in wonderland. A scary mad world where nothing made sense. Everything was upside down and I felt lost, didn't know what path to take.
As a teenager my first relationship was with someone who i now recognise was either a malignant narcissist / pyschopath. I was unable to recognise this at the time because I was unable to identify or understand what healthy relationships or love looked like. I was left to go through a termination on my own with no one to turn to or rely on.
My second relationship was with a (usually stable and well) partner with a diagnosis of bi- polar (obviously this was totally unconscious and I was unaware until he told me 3 months into the relationship) on-off for 13 years.
Regarding romantic relationships I struggle with trust and self blame. At least in the past I have struggled with boundaries and put up with certain behaviors I shouldnt have.
Adult life has been a mixed blessing for me. Negatively, I have recently gone through therapy for several months as Ive had 2 crazy years of various losses and financial instability due to a relationship break down, I really felt like I was losing my shit as I alternated between anxiety and depression. Feeling ashamed of my thoughts and feelings, dislike of self, comparing myself to others. lacking self esteem, guilt, feeling everyone hated me and felt badly of me, paranoia, and the lack of control I felt at the time.
On a positive, I am well educated with a responsible job and my own home. I have a routine. I am loyal, faithful, Im very independant and i would like to hope- am capable of love and compassion.",schizophrenia
1273,"My mum is one of the most important people in my life.
Whilst I was growing up, she sometimes had days of depression and was normally very anxious about everything. She’s had severe anxiety since she was 11. My dad was the one to explain her issues to me as I got older. He told me never to worry about it and that it wasn’t my job to worry about Mum. Well, we also never predicted what would happen next.
When I was 14 and my mum had recently hit 40, she began to act out of character. She started speaking less, appearing disorientated and started to become suspicious of everything going on the house. My dad knew something was going on, and so for a month I witnessed her completely unravel.
My mum (originally from Edinburgh and with a Scottish father) began to become paranoid that the SRA (Scottishness Republic Army-which don’t exist) were coming to abduct her, torture her and steal her soul and trap her soul in a tap with all the other Brit-Scot captives. During this time, she’d lose it if we turned on the tap since she could hear screaming and voices coming from it.
She also heard voices named Jialo and Franz (who are unfortunately still with us) who would convince her that she was the saviour to save all Scot-Brits and that Victorian zombies somehow played a part in this whole mess.
She cut herself in order to prove her bravery and strength, she was suspended from her job (she is very intelligent and worked a dentist before her break) after her paranoia started scaring patients off, woke me up in the middle of the night in order to cook poison to leave out for the SRA, convinced my then 7-year-old brother that everything she was saying was true, stopped eating and showering to the point my father would have to watch her eat and bath her (because if he left the bathing to her, she would just sit in the tub and tell him how much danger we were in and that she needed to leave to take patrol ) and eventually attempted suicide to go to ‘the better world’.
She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the late age of 40 and spent a month and a half in a psychiatric hospital. When she came out, we had to hire a caregiver for her for the next six months to help get her back on her feet. She then proceeded to have another relapse after escaping her caregiver and going to warn everyone at the local shops that there was a bomb coming and she was a hosting an evacuation. She was sectioned under law this time for a month due to the fact that she had created public disturbance. At that stage, I wasn’t sure what was going to happen next. I became positive she wouldn’t go back to being a dentist but also couldn’t imagine her doing anything low-skilled. At this stage, I felt like I was losing her and therefore she wouldn’t be able to do anything.
In this whole mess, watching your parent spiral into madness is absolutely terrifying. My mum was-and still is- one of my heros. She is always my go-to person when it comes to any issues I’m dealing with or getting advise. There are times she probably cares about helping me more than helping herself. When she got ill, I wasn’t sure if she’d the same person ever again. But even when the SRA were out to get her, she’d always make sure my brother and I were the main people that wouldn’t get captured by them.
It’s been over a year since her diagnosis and she’s doing very well. We let her caregiver go and she’s now an art teacher at a psych ward in our area. It is so convient since although she is working, she’s got support if her voices ever start up or she becomes panicky. I really do believe in a few years time, everything will return to most normal it can get. She’s still very anxious and there are times we’re out and she gets irritated by a noise I can’t here, but I love her and am so happy to see her recovering. I know she will never be the same again, but I am still so proud of her.",schizophrenia
1274,"It was the last day of school and also the announcement of awardees. I overslept. Waking up at 9 am, everything after that just happened in a flash. My mouth was burning from the extra toothpaste and my mum entered the bathroom. I was sure that I wanted to spit everything out at that very moment not because of the over the top minty flavor but because of the bleak words that came out from my mother’s mouth.
“You’re not going to get any awards, the devils told me so. And we’re pigs. We don’t deserve things like awards.”
I didn’t know how to respond. It was as if she told me that the earth is round and then after 10 years, the earth is suddenly flat.
She had her own way of teaching her children. One time, I went to school with a mark from a badminton racket when I was in first grade because I forgot to finish my notes. She would also swing the belt for every mistake that I did. I was also dragged around the house by my hair. The same, if not worse, went to my siblings who are 2 years younger and 8 years older than me.
She didn’t get along with our neighbors because “they were the devils who broke our computer” and “the devils who lured snakes into our house”. I would go home from school and hear her voice yards away calling someone a demon.
Somewhere along the line, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia: a word that was hard to spell, to pronounce, and to understand. I thought that after taking her medicine, she would immediately get well; that everything will become normal— hell, I don’t even know what that means.
She takes her medicines regularly; hit her head on the ground a few times, was unable to get up from bed, and always overslept. Nothing, even now, can silence the deafening voices that became her constant company or even, family.
The house is never silent. My mother always talks to herself —at least that’s how people sees it. And when we try to break the silence, try to speak to her, she’s still immersed in her world.
Her grip from reality was getting loose and she wasn’t as strict as before. At first, I felt free. But I was used to it, I felt dependent on her guidance. I missed her or who I thought she was.
Then, there were changes to her behavior.
The house is silent. She now thinks highly of herself, to the point where our opinions have no value to her. And she sees certain people as the trigger of her psychosis, which led her to move to an apartment about a few kilometers away from our house. With claims that she has different sorts of illnesses, she has taken tests usually resulting negative. The voices became worse, which led to her suicide attempt by overdose.
But regardless of her constant change, she is always capable of love. She tends her garden, bakes us cakes, plays with our dogs, takes care of herself (maybe a little bit too much), and loves us. After a few years of medication, she even made more friends in the neighborhood.
But schizophrenia is a word that is hard to talk about, is hard to write on letters, and is hard to understand. Her medicines are not enough, she needs help and love from us that I think I won’t be able to provide because I don’t know how.",schizophrenia
1275,"From personal experience…. Scary as hell.
My late grandmother was a full on Schizophrenic who successfully convinced her doctor that she wasn't the problem, her kids were the problem.
I grew up from the age of four walking on egg shells, never quite knowing if or when my late grandmother was going to have a Schizophrenic Breakdown.
When I had just learned to crawl, I was playing catch me if you can with two of the family cats when my late grandmother acknowledged a voice in her head that told her I a small baby was the reason why my late grandfather was sick with Cancer and the only way to ‘make him better ‘ was to take the huge Ass carving knife used to carve the Turkey (it was Thanksgiving 1980) and plunge it into my little back, fill the Turkey Baster with my clean pure blood and mix it in with the Cranberries she would feed my late grandfather, that would be enough to ‘cure ‘ his cancer.
She never got the chance to kill me as my oldest uncle walked in the door just as she was about to bring the knife down, he packed my diaper bag with bottles and diapers then packed an overnight bag with clean clothes and took me to my great grandfather's house while my late grandfather/father (he raised me from birth to age four) was called home by my aunt Aggie who then called the Police who came with Paramedics with a lovely white jacket that had crossed sleeves.
By the time he rushed home from his Doctors Appointment, my late grandmother was being taken out of the apartment on the stretcher to the waiting Ambulance and my late grandfather was informed that she'd be spending the Holidays in 3-E at the General Hospital.
Poor dad wasn't the least bit concerned about his wife and more concerned about his new granddaughter as to whom she had just tried to murder because of the voice in her head.
After he passed away from complete body cancer, things went from worse to complete and utter HELL ON EARTH.
I was at the age where I was supposed to be making friends but living with a full blown Schizophrenic that wasn't permitted because of the voices in her head insisting that friends would only take me away from her and the only way to keep me from ever leaving her alone was to chase these ‘friends ‘ away however possible ; death threats in public, Brandishing a butcher knife, hurling insults, screaming nonsensical things at them to the point where potential friends decided not to strike up a friendship with me.
Then she decided that the only way to keep me home was to grind up all her leftover Schizophrenic Medications and mix them into whatever food was prepared for breakfast, lunch, snack, supper and bedtime snack and when my God Parents or uncles intervened, she'd throw a world class tantrum, drink herself stupid, tear her clothes off, run up the street screaming for my deceased uncle Bobo.
When she was finally returned home or I should say was ESCORTED HOME WRAPPED IN A BLANKET BY THE Police, she went to the kitchen, grabbed the sharpest knife, retreated down the basement where she proceeded to slit both her wrists, slashed her legs and slit her throat and lay in the dirty laundry content to end her life.
After my late step-grandfather passed away,she fell back into her old habits and the Schizophrenia she thought was under control reared its ugly head.
The moment I got a call from a potential employer who was willing to train me on the job, she just lost it, she started screaming that The Federal Government was listening to all our conversations, were tracking our TV viewing habits, our spending habits, our bathroom habits, our bathing habits, our sleeping habits, our shopping habits and our eating habit and no matter what, I could NOT take the job because it was the Federal Government in Washington's way of getting her alone so they could whisk her away to Washington to a Super Secret Prison for Elderly Schizophrenic Patients for the rest of her life.
She drove me to the point where one day during the summer when she had been on the floor of her bedroom for nearly a month, I couldn't take her hollering and screaming at no one in the living room that was off her bedroom that I actually started fearing for not only MY safety but for the safety and well-being of our two small dogs, that I called my Nurse Practitioner and explained the situation to her and was told that I needed to pack up the dog's with their food and water bowls and some toys, ensure that I had some cash on hand so I could get something to eat wherever I decided to go and ensure that I had bus fare and taxi fare.
If I needed taxi money, I could stop by the clinic and pick up an emergency taxi voucher and a bus pass to get me back home from wherever I decided to go.
After I left home with the dogs, caught the bus to Loblaws, transferred to nine downtown, got off at Shoppers and went to the clinic to pick up the bus pass and taxi voucher then after I left the clinic, I walked to the Cemetery in search of my dad's grave just to say ‘hi’ and update him on mom's behaviour not that he needed an update, he probably had a front row seat from the afterlife of her behavior.
By the time I got to Point Edward, had lunch and just loafed watching the boats go by, four police cruisers with two cops each pulled into the parking lot and all eight Officers got out, walked over to me asked me if I was related to a Rosemarie Hardy located on insert old address.
I said I was, pulled out my cell phone and called my Uncle who was my emergency contact and when he answered I let him talk to the Officer from Sarnia Police Department to explain that under no circumstances was anyone to involve me in his mother's situation no matter how much she cried crocodile tears.
The Officer handed me my phone and simply said that I was to be left alone and that under no circumstances was I to be dragged into the situation at home.
They left me alone and by the time I got home, my late grandmother was already admitted to the Hospital and was undergoing a full Psychiatric Evaluation.
The next day I got a call from the Doctor who said what I already knew: My grandmother was a full on Schizophrenic with illusions and was hearing voices in her head…nothing I didn't already know.
Growing up with a Schizophrenic is a game of chance, you never know what will set them off its especially scary when they start hearing and acknowledging the voices in their heads telling them to do certain things they normally wouldn't do.
In my case, my late grandmother was also a raging alcoholic and chain smoker with suicidal tenancies who convinced her doctor that she wasn't the problem, her kids were the problem and decided that the best way to shut up a kid who just wanted some attention and love was to feed them her medication.
So What is it like growing up with a schizophrenic parent? Scary as hell!
The only way to get out of a Schizophrenic house and be normal is to placate them until you have had enough then leave before you go batty.",schizophrenia
1276,"My mom was bipolar-schizophrenic. I didn’t even know it was a thing. my fingers were trembeling when I read the letter. Then I remembered her reasoning, the start and the tipping point.
Imagine
There was a day I remembered I was listening to John Lennon’s “imagine”. She enters the room I didn’t say anything, I ignored her. She walked up to me and says “The goverment is trying to kill me and you’re listening to music”. This is one of her many episodes I just ignored her, I kept on listening to the music.
She walked up to me and kept on rambling the same thing “So you want the government to murder me, the neighbours are already starting a plan against me… CNN told me that the base business will start so will you help me or not?”
I removed my headphones and looked her deep in the eyes. I said “Mom, you’re not making any sense, please stop”. She didn’t care what I was saying because to her it made sense she left the room. I realised I could not stop her I couldn’t even stop her line of reasoning.
A few months later
It was the week of my birthday. I came back from school and was on my way home. But I felt a certain feeling of unease. I just randomly thought what if my mom just decided that the neighbours were conspiring against her and followed her thought and decided to confront the neighbours about this?
Nah she wouldn’t do that she isn’t that Ill. I was wrong, oh so wrong. There she was holding a broomstick yelling at the top of her lungs to the neighbours. The police came they took her. I didn’t had the chance to even say goodbye.
How it feels like?
It feels like you’re seeing your parent slowly die right infront of you. The most reasonable person in the house suddenly becomes the most irratic. It makes you feel lonely in your own house.
I’m glad that she came back from the hospital and is now a well function human bieng but it took some time. I don’t speak for all the people who grew up with a parent with this mental illnes I am speaking for myself and how I expirienced it.",schizophrenia
1277,"For me, it was very, very confusing and frustrating. My mother is a schizophrenic, at least that’s what she told me. I honestly didn’t know what she had growing up, I just knew she wasn’t right in the head and I only found out what she had after she told me over the phone last year. My mother was actually quite a smart person when she was little. Straight A’s, active, all that jazz …but then things were going south and she started hanging with the wrong people, sneaking out, running away and eventually became pregnant with me at 14, and birthed me at 15. I honestly do not know when the schizophrenia kicked in and my grandmother tried to spare me most of my mother’s childhood. I have many more questions but she passed in 2015 but she told me it was my dad’s fault …but then my paternal grandmother, who is still alive, says it was her own fault. I honestly don’t know but anyway…
I was adored as a baby by the rest of my family since they told me that I was the golden child, although I don’t know about my mother’s involvement. Not long after, my little sister was born in 2002 with a different man. When I was a toddler, I thought what she did was normal as she would do a lot of twitching, talking to herself and uh …take me to my dad’s house and have sex directly behind quite frequently while I sat and played video games and was told “not to look”. My dad was not a great dad either, but he wasn’t schizo, just an ass …he left when I was around 4, saw him when I was around 9–10 when I saw him and then never saw him again afterwards. I remember the bad fights they had, and how one time she told me and him to fuck off and I went home with my dad. Asked if he was alright and he just sat there and hugged me in the dark and told me that my sister’s father can go fuck himself, and that girl was not my sister. He creeped me out but anyway, not the point, back to my mother.
My maternal grandmother knew she wasn’t right in the head, since she would take me on long walks on the highway, getting us lost in the middle of nowhere, left me with questionable “friends” of hers and before I knew it, I was living with my grandmother at 5, as my mother was deemed unfit to care for me or my newborn brother that was born that same year I as taken into my grandmother’s custody (2006). While I was living life with my grandmother, mother’s life was slowly going down the shitter. She did drugs, smoked, drinked, and started getting violent. My grandmother, being her mother, loved her but couldn’t afford to have her in her house as she would steal, threaten her and us as well as my uncles, her own brothers, and my cousins. She fought the police, went to prison, put in a psychiatric ward, and was released. (remember I said she was smart …yeah, faked good behavior and waited until she was out to stop taking meds)
She lived with me twice in my grandmother’s household because of course, my grandmother still loves her, and had sympathy cause my mother was homeless. She stayed in MY room which I complied to but quickly regretted as she started dirtying it, smoking in it, acting like it was HER room, and just being gross. She would talk to her other personalities or voices often, ask me if I would see the things she saw and I didn’t, and after stealing from us multiple times, my grandmother kicked her out and she moved into out hallway which she peed in and her laughter and giggling would keep me up at night.
I’m sorry this has gotten so long, but let’s just say she has threatened to kill me and my brother and my grandmother multiple times (sister was put in custody of her father at very young age so her life was good), fought my uncles, their girlfriends, and just so much shit that I didn’t even consider her my mother as I was confused and angry at why she acted like this since I didn’t know she was mentally ill. Always asked for money, never paid back ,never was around for us, and eventually moved to Arizona ….only to come back in November 2013, tell us we have a baby brother with a random man who no body knows and that they are stuck there in Arizona since my mother is not fit to take care of a child. We tried our best to adopt him but my grandmother passed in 2015 and my family did nothing to get that baby …
Needless to say, my after my grandmother’s passing, my mother did not show up to the funeral but all of a sudden she tried to redeem herself, by going to rehab and seeking help, getting a job and trying to be involved in our lives buuut as much as I appreciate her efforts, the damage is done. My sister hates her, and I don’t feel comfortable being around her in general nor does my brother, her efforts are appreciated but unwanted but she still tries. She knows there is nothing that can truly fix things between her children judge me or not, I don’t want anything to do with her. Maybe that’ll change since I’m just 17, but right now, I was comfortable without her in my life for years, I don’t want her in it now. Yes, she’s still quite unstable and still talks to her self, sees things and she does have psychotic episodes, she had one with me over text a month ago recently as well as another one in her workplace, though being a truck driver ….it was probably bound to happen.
Again, sorry it this was long but that’s my schizo mom and hopefully someone got a kick out of this story.",schizophrenia
1278,"I actually wrote my Common App essay about growing up with my mother’s schizophrenia, so I might as well put it here. I hope you enjoy!
Most mothers are known for making their children dinner after school and driving them to soccer practice. They do laundry, organize doctor appointments, and dominate the art of taking family photos. They comfort us when we scrape our knees. However, my experiences with my mom contrast my peers’ for a variety of reasons.
My dad estimates my mom developed schizophrenia in her mid thirties. She was diagnosed in 2010. She took medication for a short period of time before stopping due to the side effects. She would self-medicate through drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes; something I didn’t realize wasn’t normal until a friend’s parent scolded her for smoking around me.
Growing up with my mother’s behavior was challenging. She would randomly throw household items away with the belief they were harming us, specifically through scent. She claimed to smell something strange and throw it away. Clothes, photographs, and toys were common victims, and it was a weekly occurrence to come home and find that my favorite t-shirt had disappeared from my room. I would cry over my missing Barbies and bicycles and my father would give me a sympathetic pat on the head.
As I got older, my tolerance for my mother’s actions grew thin. I had classmates asking why I wore the same 3 shirts every week. I had teachers pulling me out of class to ask if I smoked cigarettes because I always smelled like ash. I was caught between defending my parents’ vices and have teachers unfairly judge them.
When I began high school, my anger towards my mom began to emerge. I remember the arguments. I remember asking my dad if there was any way we could force her to medicate. I remember crying over her throwing away my boyfriend’s sweater. My relationship with her began to deteriorate.
I took matters into my own hands. I was tired of nothing being done to change my mom’s actions. I installed a bolt on my door and locked it whenever I left the house to ensure she couldn’t get in. I pleaded with her not to throw away specific items, only to see them in the trash can later.
Eventually, her health began to decline. She developed cataracts in both eyes. Bringing her to the hospital was a nightmare. She would get agitated and anxious and take it out on me and the hospital staff.
I was angry at my parents. Why couldn’t my dad be with us? Why did a 15-year-old girl have to be the one to speak to doctors on behalf of her 48-year-old mother?
It hit me while I was in the waiting room. She couldn’t control the way she was acting. She wasn’t trying to ruin my life, but her illness was controlling hers. She needed my support while she was going through something scary and was grateful I was providing it, even though she had a difficult time showing it.
My relationship with my mother isn’t perfect. I’m still learning how to manage her behavior. She isn’t herself when she has one of her episodes, and I’m aware of that, and it has made me come to terms with the fact that there are some things we just can’t control in life. Living with her has taught me to be patient and empathetic when it comes to people’s situations, and to recognize that mental health plays a huge role in the quality of life in others.
I’ve come to appreciate the little things my mom does for me and accept that her illness is a part of her. I hope someday I’ll be able to help her ease the grip schizophrenia has on her. To me, that means being there for her when she needs me. After all, I wouldn’t be the person I am today without her.",schizophrenia
1279,"My biological mother was diagnosed and institutionalized with schizophrenia when I was a baby.
My dad came home to her staring out the kitchen window at me outside while I cried. The voices she heard had told her to put me outside in the snow in nothing but a diaper. My dad couldn't handle her any longer and the danger to me was too great. He divorced her before I was 2 years old.
She was in the institution for almost 4 years where she met and married my stepfather who was also institutionalized for drug issues. I remember going to visit them as a 6 year old and having fun. They played on a softball team and my mother was working for a small office supply store. They were active and outgoing and were well liked. They moved into a nice house and started having more children and things were okay for a while.
Things became different after a while and I didn't understand. I watched a woman who was able to do quadratic equations in her head turn into someone who had trouble putting sentences together. My stepfather began to change too and became very angry and it got to a point where I didn't want to be around them. I remember holding my little brother after a beating with a wooden spoon because he had shouted too loudly. When I was 12 I held my mother until after midnight while she cried and told me how much she hated her life.
All of the schizophrenics that I have known or read about are brilliant people. It is like their brain is so smart that it quits working correctly. They are capable of putting together such things of beauty or use their brains in such a way that it left me blown away. The medications that they are prescribed tend to dull them and slow their brains. It is heartbreaking to see. The longer they are on these medications the worse it becomes and many times it is too much for them to handle. A friend I had when I was younger believed he was haunted until I explained to him what schizophrenia was and after some discussions he finally went to the doctor and was diagnosed. He ended up killing himself several months later because when he was on his medications he lost that bit of himself that was creative.
When I was 16 my mother attempted suicide which is what prompted my father telling me the truth her mental issues. I spent hours in the office of the school counselor and started seeing a psychiatrist. One of the guys in a class actually asked me for updates on what was happening because it made him feel so much better about his life.
It is 17 years later and my biological mother has to check into the institution about once a year when she gets suicidal. Her doctors have to change her meds frequently because they stop working as well. I have had to listen to her talk about hurting the children of my brothers and sisters because the voices tell her to. Many years ago I decided I would never have children because I do not want to pass on these genes or have to deal with the heartbreak of having a child with schizophrenia.
There is no way to cover the list of emotions that I have experienced because of this or how it has shaped me as a person. I have felt shock and horror, guilt and anger. Someone else mentioned feeling hope however I haven't felt that in regards to my biological mother since I can remember. Since I was a teen I have seperated myself from that part of my life and while I try to talk to her every so often, I haven't seen her in over three years. It is too hard and hurts me too much. To protect myself and my sanity I had to walk away and that is a guilt I feel every day.",schizophrenia
1280,"I can understand what you are going through. Get help and don't lose hope. Meds can help only with a good social support system. I hope my answer helps you.
My experience was scarring to say the least :(..
Well in my case I did not have a word to describe what was happening to my mother. I always thought she was a bad person who just did not care for anyonee. Sometimes I thought she was possessed by an evil spirit. I grew up in the times of 'evil dead' and ‘the omen' :)
I remember the anxiety attacks I would have wondering what she is going to do next.i would cry in solitude and plot ways to run away from home. My mom strongly believed I was dad's secret child. This stemmed from the fact I did not look like her.
So growing up, I was never her favorite and was always treated like an alien in the house. That includes not being fed and being kicked around.
To make it short, here is what it did to me
Never felt loved and learnt how to love
Always felt inadequate no matter how good I was.
Couldn't make friends easily and would lose the ones I did.
Got into wrong company and did stupid stuff. Don't ask what :)
All the stress of protecting her from herself broke my health.
But the positive side is
Learnt to live alone. My loneliness spooks my near and dear ones but i just love being alone;)
Understood what mental illnesses are and what they can do to a person
Gave me the courage to stand up for what I believe cos life couldn't get worse than this.
Made me step back a little and look at the society as my family. Mine didn't exist.
Helped me realize that being poor has got nothing to do with money.
Today I have the satisfaction of helping my mom become an independent person. She flies from one end of the world to other on her own. Takes care of her granddaughters.Paints,reads and makes beautiful clothes. It's like she is a totally different person.she manages her condition beautifully and has become my inspiration. Life is good again..oh wait , it was always good..I just did not look at it the right way :)
Stay strong and respect yourself for being able to live amidst all this.take care of yourself and see if you can get help from some NGOs for people with mental disorders.",schizophrenia
1281,"It’s not great. My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic. I didn’t know this when I was little and she was behaving weirdly but I found out eventually.
She left when I was 2. She was fighting with my dad and I watched the whole thing. She said she was going down the shop to get some cheese even though it was 10pm and the shops were shut. She left and never came back to our family home. I struggled with that. For years I waited and waited for my family to be whole and complete again.
We would go on holiday to see her. She’d forget we were there, have terrible mood swings and sometimes was generally unpleasant. I remember one time she said she wasn’t feeling very well so we dressed up in Christmas decorations to try and cheer her up and she shouted at us and grounded us for a week..
It was difficult. She never seemed focused or happy or attentitive to us. To be truthful I’m not sure she loved us at all, I wouldn’t feel so abandoned by her if she did and she treated me right.
I wouldn’t wish it on anyone let’s put it that way. To feel so disconnected from someone who is meant to love you is tough. She’s been sectioned a few times. The first time I found out was when she didn’t call on the day she was meant to but my nana did to tell dad that she’d had a nervous breakdown and was in hospital.
It’s not all bad though because I have a father who loves me dearly and he’s been there through it all and has never given up on me or my brother. Having one stable, loving parent has been so good for me but nothing will replace or fix the lack of love I received from my mother",schizophrenia
1282,"When I was a teenager I became friends with a sixteen-year-old girl -- let's call her Mandy -- whose mother was schizophrenic. Mandy's father was an alcoholic who was mentally and emotionally checked out pretty much all the time because he didn't have the energy or desire (not sure which he was lacking more of) to leave his wife, but also had no interest in interacting with her.
Mandy hadn't had much of a childhood. By the time I met her when she was sixteen, she was an adult already. Too early.
She was the one supporting her mother. Her dad seemed to subsist mostly on alcohol, so he didn't need much supporting (he always found himself some money for booze, and otherwise it was hard to tell if he had any needs at all), but her mother was an indescribably intense bundle of needs.
Her mom had paranoid schizophrenia. She didn't seem to hallucinate -- ie she didn't have sensory experiences of things not there -- but her life was ruled by paranoid delusions.
Sometimes she'd take medication if she got so bad as to be forced into the hospital, and the medication worked, but she was one of those people who stopped her meds as soon as she felt better. ""I'm well! I don't need them anymore!"" As soon as the effects of her antipsychotic meds faded, she'd be back to her absurd delusions and it would be impossible to coax her back into willingly taking her meds.
Mandy loved her mom a lot, and she didn't want Akron Children's Services (I grew up in Akron, Ohio) to take her away from home. She felt her mom would die if Mandy couldn't be around to parent her. Mandy somehow managed to wrangle the situation so she could do schoolwork online while also working an obscene amount of hours each week. Each day.
Mandy was so discouraged that she wasn't legally allowed to work full time, or late late late into the night. Eventually she figured out how to work one job part time legally and two more under the table. She got B's and C's in her online classes, which was low considering her intellectual brilliance but high considering how much shit she had to put up with -- take your pick.
We, her friends, all learned that calling her home was a bad idea. She gave out her number with the warning to call only if we didn't hear from her for days, but we were teenagers and we were stupid and so some of us called. If her mom answered we'd hear that OH MY GOD NOW THE GOVERNMENT IS HIRING TEENAGERS TO SPY ON ME OH MY GOD OH MY GOD. If her dad picked up we got yelled at for risking the reaction I just mentioned in the sentence before this one.
Mandy was, as I said above, an adult before she should have been. But once it's done, it's done, and there's no turning back, and trying to turn back wouldn't fix anything anyway. If Mandy had been removed from the situation and her mom had been cured and her dad had become sober, she still would never again have had a chance to be a child.
At eighteen Mandy had a baby and she finally moved out. She didn't want her kid to be subjected to the things I've described here. We lost track of each other. I think she got as far away as she could from where she'd been stuck for eighteen long years.",schizophrenia
1283,"My mother was schizophrenic since before I was born. I didn't find out until I was 14 and living alone with her because she went off her meds. I guess my dad and siblings didn't tell me because they thought I didn't need to know while it was under control and I was so young so they thought I wouldn't understand. What I learned pretty quickly was you can't reason with someone who has an untreated mental illness. All the logic in the world won't cure them and it just frustrates you. As I grew older, I learned that she wasn't a bad mother, just sick. That was a tough one. It is easy to feel sorry for oneself for not having a ""normal"" parent like other kids, but it also taught me compassion and patience. It taught me a lot of real life lessons as I grew up emotionally very rapidly as I learned to take care of myself as well as my mother.
I moved out at 17 and became independent while still caring for her. I learned to be selfish and set boundaries. There was a strong obligation to care for her but equally strong was to make sure my needs were met and not sacrifice my own mental health by being a martyr and subjecting myself to living with someone who could endanger me. I was able to place her in assisted living homes where they could make sure she took her medication. She was 60 by the time I was 20 and clearly could not take care of herself if she didn't take medication, so that was key. I was strong enough to realize there were other ways to manage this without the drama of having to live with it daily and work and go to college. I have no regrets. I was always there for her through many hospitalizations, both physical and mental, repeatedly placing her in a new facility and working with her doctors and caretakers to make sure she didn't get overlooked. She passed away last year at 87. I visited her regularly and bought her clothes and made sure the nurses knew she had family that cared and was watching. It has molded me as a caretaker of others. Like I said, no regrets. The experience made me who I am today and prepared me for much of life's hardships early on. I'm grateful for her.",schizophrenia

So much so, he spends a lot of time perched against a cross. The other family members plot to steal the Earl's inheritance but all manner of complications ensue! It is a crazy ride from the word go, with the story being decidedly anti establishment.

1289,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia
1290,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia

1298,"Great question, dear QPG! This is absolutely a solid and much desired improvement. Most Bollywood films do a bad job of showing mental illness in a realistic or accurate way. But there are some films that have represented and dealt with schizophrenia in an accurate way. The movie that has best done that is 15 Park Avenue. Konkana Sen Sharma has turned in an excellent performance in that film.
Karthik Calling Karthik is another film that did a decent job of portraying schizophrenia. And, I guess Woh Lamhe did a decent job. However, that’s really it - other films that have represented schizophrenics have usually messed it up. You have movies like Madhoshi and Atrangi Re in that latter category. But like I said, the Konkana Sen Sharma film is perhaps the best of the

1299,"This is only a partial answer to your question. I am only refering to the “hearing voices part”
Have any of you seen, the new movie, what men want(2019). Remember when she was walking around everywhere and could hear what every man is thinking. Imagine this happening to you everyday in real life. Next, imagine how hard it would be to concentrate while taking to someone or working on a project with “all the voices talking”. Well for someone with schizophrenia who has auditory hallucinations, this is what it is like when they hallucinate. I generally only hear 2 “so called people” taking about me and putting me down at a time. Now imagine walking around and constantly hearing people insult you, it takes a major toll on your self esteem and confidence. Not everyone hears all negative stuff but unfortunately i do. And yes, hallucinations come and go at randon times and are not and all day constant thing(unless you are having a major episode). When i watched the movie i was like, now other can finally understand to some extent what i go through.",schizophrenia
1300,"I am not schizophrenic or I don’t know any person with schizophrenia, but I work for a pharma company, where we have an Rx drug for these people. From my work I have found out that often people do not know what really being schizophrenic really means, and therefore there is a huge missconception around the illness. Ofter people do stigmatize people with schizophrenia and think that they are so to say monsters. That can happen that a person having schizophrenia will believe these missconceptions if he or she is not well informed about his/her illness. Having schizophrenia is caused by an imbalance level of molecules in the brain of the patient, so there is an obvious biological explanation of the illness.
In many cases unfortunatelly it is very hard to identify who has schizophrenia and who not and often it is missdiagnosed as depression (due to the negative symptoms).
For better understanding the illness also schizophrenic and non schizophrenic people should watch movies and read as much as possible about the illness.
I have seen a beautiful film about a filmmaker, whose mother has schizophrenia, I really suggest you to watch it.
I doing vlogs, where I have also talked about this film and also did a trailer to it, enjoy :)",schizophrenia
1301,"1. Taare Zameen Par
Taare Zameen Par, starring Aamir Khan, was unquestionably the most successful film of 2007. It sparked a discussion about a learning handicap that was more common than most of us realized but had never been explored in mainstream cinema. The subject was treated in a very balanced yet realistic manner, allowing us to witness the reality of mental strain and bullying that people with dyslexia face from peers, teachers, and, in some cases, even their own families.
2. Dear Zindagi
Alia Bhatt's character in Dear Zindagi was the most relatable I'd seen on the big screen. Yes, more relatable than a character who refuses to accept his obligations and instead travels across the world (Hello, Bunny from YJHD). Alia Bhatt's acting abilities are unrivaled in mainstream Bollywood, but the film was also incredibly well-written. From normalizing therapy and mistaking therapy for love to discussing mental health difficulties with one's family, the film touched on a variety of sensitive topics. It effectively communicated that, while one's problems are genuine and visible, they can be resolved.
3. Chhichhore
For good cause, this film starring Sushant Singh Rajput was critically lauded and highly recommended. The film addressed exam anxiety, pressure, and suicide. The story depicted what it is like to be under great pressure (something that is very common in our society and is perpetuated by a cut-throat education system). The film finished on a positive note, discouraging people from considering suicide as an escape strategy.
4. Judgementall Hai Kya
The Kangana Ranaut film was about a woman who had deep-seated traumas from her father's abuse of her mother, to the point where she began believing that all men are beasts. It described her as someone who would frequently hallucinate as a result of her trauma, which caused her to become schizophrenic. The title is a pun on the word ""mental hai kya?"" which is commonly used to describe those who have mental illnesses or disorders. In the comments, tell us which movie helped to normalize the talk around mental health difficulties and disorders for you. The film finished on a positive note, discouraging people from considering suicide as an escape strategy.",schizophrenia

1303,"I've had Schizo for last ten years and recently recovered from it. While 90% of the world is likely to go by what psychiatry says and most books on the subject will be written by psychiatrists N mental health institutions, Trust me when I say this a lot of it is mumbo jumbo. In case of Schizo it is better to learn from real people's experiences rather than medical practitioners. While medical practitioners will be happy to feed u heavy doses of antipsychotics, that is not good long term strategy. It gives you support in your initial years to help fight the disease but I have read experiences of many people including my own and at some point one has to stop relying on medication and handle the disease. Most people agree that long term recovery is generally better in people who stop medication. Take the case of Dr. Nash the famous person who inspired the movie beautiful mind. He frequented to hospitals for many years until eventually he decided to stop taking medication. Then he struggled with the disease himself and with the support of his family and eventually went onto win Nobel Prize. Medicine makes u incapacitated in many ways and even bedridden (in my case for 3 years) so u have a vegetative life. You cannot do most work. That is not a life worth living. I myself left medication and psychiatrists for last 10 months and actually recovered better than when I had medication. There are many things one can do based on experience that can help fight and even recover from Schizo. I can tell u many things if you write to me on Sourabhkum@gmail.com. There may be things you can learn from other people's experiences also bur there are many things I have learned that can help.",schizophrenia
1304,"Great question, dear QPG! This is absolutely a solid and much desired improvement. Most Bollywood films do a bad job of showing mental illness in a realistic or accurate way. But there are some films that have represented and dealt with schizophrenia in an accurate way. The movie that has best done that is 15 Park Avenue. Konkana Sen Sharma has turned in an excellent performance in that film.
Karthik Calling Karthik is another film that did a decent job of portraying schizophrenia. And, I guess Woh Lamhe did a decent job. However, that’s really it - other films that have represented schizophrenics have usually messed it up. You have movies like Madhoshi and Atrangi Re in that latter category. But like I said, the Konkana Sen Sharma film is perhaps the best of the lot.",schizophrenia

1306,"My psychiatrist told me that finding the right combination of medication is like being a chemist…everyone is different, reacts differently.
They now have DNA tests you take that illustrate which medications are compatible with your genome.
So, after finding the right combination of medications, you might have psychotherapy. I was discharged from psychotherapy because, after a year, I didn't need it any longer. My problems were your problems. Mental illness wasn't navigating my life. My pain was your pain. I fight hard through schizophrenia. I try so hard.
So, now it's just medication monitoring with the psychiatrist every 4 months for 15 minutes.
Now. Is treatment working? I still have hallucinations, multiple times everyday or none at all for 5 months. And everything in between. The Negitive symptoms persist and I feel I am deteriorating. The major depression symptoms come and go. Sometimes symptoms from both completely level me, or I may just have symptoms from one and very few times, I have symptoms of neither. Those days are rare, but fantastic.
Windows and waves. If I dip in the world of psychosis or fall deep into the marianna trench of depression, the medication pulls me out. They become shorter episodes and not as intense.
Otherwise, I set goals for myself everyday. I need a sense of accomplishment in my life, since I was very high functioning before the illness. Sometimes I fail my goals, but its okay... I try again when I feel better.
I dont leave the house much, and have been training myself how to be a mechanic. I am still learning, but I can do quite abit…I just put new timing cover gasket, water pump and gasket and oil pan gasket on my daughters car before she left for college. The car is working great for her.
I am capable of intelligent work, I just have some bad side effects that prohibit me from any full time employment…I am trying to work part time, but I have no idea which symptoms I will have tomorrow, so I am afraid. Not lazy, afraid of getting fired. I have a nice pension i receive, so I am grateful for that.

1307,"Question: What are some of the most effective treatments for schizophrenia?
Answer: It depends entirely on the person who has schizophrenia and many factors related to their life and brain biology, but one treatment option that is essentially underutilized and often quite effective is the use of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics.
I have a bias, because the LAIs transformed my outcome. I started having issues around the age of 15 and for 12 years struggled severely with my mental illness. I was in and out of hospitals, suicidal, reckless, psychotic (on and off), and could not function very well. That all changed when my awesome doctor decided to try a LAI of Haldol. I wasn’t happy about getting the injection. At the time I was in the hospital, and I was delusional and thought the doctor was giving me a lethal injection to kill me. Little did I know that it would save my life.
At one point I tried switching to the Abilify Maintena injection, but that didn’t work for me, so I switched back to the Haldol. So, it will still be a trial to figure out which kind of medication works. I still have bad days, but that is more within the range of normal.
However, I should note that you can’t just give someone an injection and send them on their way. People with severe mental illness need other supports like community and/or family/friend support, financial, housing, and food security and stability. We need ongoing medical treatment. We need access to medications. We need acceptance and education surrounding mental illness. Some people need substance abuse treatment. Therapy can be helpful. Some people have a history of abuse and mistreatment that they will need help with. And most people who would take LAIs will need other medications in addition to the LAIs. They would need a skilled psychiatrist to administer medications and make adjustments. If someone gets the injections they’d also need access to a clinic that is willing to administer the medications. Surprisingly, I’ve run into issues where clinics have refused to administer the injection, because they are unfamiliar with it.
It is VERY difficult in the US for people to get all of their needs met, or even a minimal amount of their needs met, and until we address the systemic issues there will continue to be people dying in the streets.",schizophrenia
1308,"It varies.
It comes down to level of functioning and how much an individual can tolerate their symptoms. If two people experienced the same exact symptoms, they’re definition of being “treated” would vary based on their personal characteristics.
Right now, there is still not a lot that we understand about schizophrenia, especially biologically. The last 20 years has given us better insight to correlations schizophrenia and the brain, but we still understand very little. Current medications are generally to reduce symptoms, especially positive symptoms, but none stand out as the gold standard. Again, every person is different.
What makes things more complicated is that schizophrenia is a social disorder as well. Where you live really impacts the presentation of your symptoms. For instance, a person suffering from schizophrenia in America may hear or see different things compared to someone who lives somewhere else. In America, hallucinations and delusions tend to be extremely negative, persecutory, or mean. In other parts of the world, hallucinations are seen as simply imaginary voices or people.
Long answer short, effectiveness comes down to the person and what they would consider to be effective. There is no cure currently, but it is also not a life sentence by any means.",schizophrenia
1309,"Is CBD Oil Effective in the Treatment of Schizophrenia?
Many people claim that CBD helps them manage health conditions such as pain, anxiety, sleep problems, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). CBD is short for cannabidiol, a natural compound in cannabis (also known as marijuana) and hemp plants. It has the same chemical makeup as cannabis but doesn’t cause a high.
In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a type of CBD for the treatment of seizures in children. Scientists are also studying CBD oil -- the most concentrated form -- for dozens of other health conditions, including schizophrenia.
What the Experts Say
Joseph Pierre, MD, a psychiatrist and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, says CBD’s potential role in schizophrenia treatment starts with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound in cannabis that causes a high. THC can cause psychotic symptoms in some people, he says. And long-time cannabis users, especially those who start when they’re young, may be more likely to get a disorder like schizophrenia.

1310,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?

1311,"Incredibly ineffective. The outlook in psychiatry right now is basically to deprescribe medications if possible and look at diet changes to low carb or keto diets and exercise as treatments. It is a profound failure from psychiatry and science to do anything of value for people and worst of all there’s really no outrage on the matter. That said, there are 100’s of better treatments in clinical trials right now being tested for all sorts of neurological and psychiatric issues but they seem stalled in those clinical trials.

You say “there are no objective criteria for schizophrenia”.
True, but irrelevant. It exists regardless.
Schizophrenia can be very very harmful. Maybe you, or someone you know has it mildly. Lucky them. Perhaps in their case the negatives of the antipsychotics outweigh the positives. They are horrible drugs.
However for many people while it may or may not come in waves, it is progressive. It makes them a danger to themselves and others - there is no other set of treatments which work, and these work very well.

Schizophrenia is typically treated with antipsychotics to help manage symptoms and prevent relapse. It's important for people with schizophrenia to stick with their treatment plan in order to have the best outcome.

1315,"In the United Kingdom, ever since Victotian times there were large psychiatric hospitals of about 1,000 beds, for every county, some more, some less. These hospitals largely endured until the early 1950’s. Most, but not all, were people with psychosis, manic depression, chronic depression, schizophrenia. They filled the hospitals because there were no treatments. But by the 1970’s beds were being reduced. By the 1980’s wards on a large scale closed for good as treatments improved. There were very few chronic patients being admitted. Dementia rates started to increase as life expectancy increased. The patients who had not recieved treatment soon enough (before the 1950’s) were dying of natural causes.
Finally it was predicted that all these large psychiatric hospitals would become empty or only partially inhabited. It was decided to manage a run down and closure of these hospitals.
So basically treatment became so good big hospitals were not needed anyway.
The position now is that the vast majority of patients with major mental ilness’s like Schizophrenia will get better. Provided they are correctly diagnosed, correctly treated and caught in good time. The longer a major mental ilness is not treated the more negative is the prognosis. So in the vast majority of cases schizophrenia will be cured or controlled. Whilst pschiatrists are good, you still need to connect with the right doctor and he/she has to diagnose correctly (diagnosis is vitally important because it leads to the correct treatment path). Finally patients have to take their medication as prescribed. Most relapses are caused by patients who declare themselves “cured”and stop taking their medication. The challenges of mental health now is a faster pace of life, more stress and more neurosis. Dementia continues to increase as we live longer. Dementia is the new challenge and managing stress.

The best that we can hope for, is effective symptom management…and sometimes periods of symptom remission. Both of those are considered a great victory.
Why hasn’t there been a cure for schizophrenia? Advocacy.
Schizophrenia affects about 1 in 100 people….yet, the people affected are also the least able to advocate for their own care, treatments or cures.
They are not like Breast Cancer where the victim is often able to advocate, or Autism (that have active parental involvement). People with schizophrenia are often the most compromised, people who are often forgotten, who families sometimes abandon, and who often have very few people actively in their corner.
It breaks my heart.
People with schizophrenia grow up much like you and I. They have dreams, hopes, things they want for their life….and often (not always), these things are stolen from them in the most terrible of ways, and they are left to fend for themselves at a time when they are most compromised in their abilities.

My ex girlfriend has schizophrenia, so I'll base my answer on her.
The drugs took her from saying random things which didn't make sense, to making sense. They then kept her stable, she relapsed a few months after stopping.
They are very effective really, in years gone by she might have stayed like that until she died.
However, they also come with side effects. She felt depressed. She had her libido drop, she became partially anorgasmic, she lost feeling in her errogeneous zones, many if these effects continued after she stopped taking them - but she did not stay off them long enough to know whether they would return.

1319,"It took a very long time, 5 years+, to find medication that was helpful in any way. Therapy helped a lot with identifying and combating unproductive thoughts. After years of therapy and trial and error of more medications than I can count and a lot of hard work and constant effort there was what you can call a large improvement. At the bottom, life was constant suffering, where every fraction of every second seemed like an eternal hell and it was impossible to have any value or meaning in life or relationship with my family or to accomplish any task no matter how simple. It improved enough so that the constant acute suffering ended, I can have meaningful communication with some people, and I can accomplish some tasks. It's enough to be able to convince myself that there is value in my life and reasons to be alive. But life is still nothing like it was before onset and the amazing dynamic person with great success in social and professional life that I once was appears to be gone forever.

For some people achieving something close to a full recovery does seem to happen. It may be influenced by how quickly the problem is recognized and treated. If you notice changes in yourself or someone you love, try to get help as soon as possible. Very often people with schizophrenia lack insight about what is happening to them and the illness often comes on very gradually. The slow deterioration and lack of insight can contribute to the disease progressing a long way before treatment is sought voluntarily or involuntarily.",schizophrenia
1320,"There are none that do that, at least no “drug treatments”.
For years I was on most 1st and second class anti psychotic drugs( which are not literally “anti” psychotic) for positive symptons and I have had ECT for negative symptoms. For me the ECT helped with suicidality but that’s all. The drugs when I was on them resulted in increasingly frequent psych hospitalisations, in tardive dyskinesia, in LongQT which nearly killed me, in an inability to concentrate, dangerous carelessness/ recklessness, in loss of ability to study or work or independently care for myself or my daughter. I have been off all those drugs for a several years except for when I've been hospitalised, my longQT is improved, tardive dyskinesia is the same since it's irreversible, I've had no more negative symptoms and I've been able to study again and take care of my daughter independebtly as a single mom and my hospitalisations are far far less frequent and shorter than when I was on the drugs.
The only thing drugs used for schizophrenia do is sedate people, damage their brains and their bodies.
The actual cause of what is referred to as schizophrenia is not known. There are only theories and hypotheses, like the ‘dopamine hypothesis’ which is conterversial based on studies. The dopamine hypothesis is based on correlation and not causation, it has to do with the observation that people who take dopamine inhibiting drugs seem to have less hallucinations, which is not at all evidence that these people have abnormally high levels of dopamine to begin with or that high or normal levels of dopamine somehow cause hallucinations.
There are no drugs that treat/ improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia which are the most problematic/ disabling symptoms and the drugs used to treat the positive symptoms seem to actually worsen the negative symptoms.
There is no evidence that people who take the antipsychotic drugs and get a lessening of positive symptoms would not have had a lessening of those symptoms without the use of those drugs.
The damage done to the brain and other organs and systems by the drugs is far worse than what these drugs supposedly treat.
If you need to be covinced of that there are plenty of studies and articles you can read on how these drugs cause irreversible brain damage as can be seen when people develope tardive dyskinesia which is often very debilitating.
The drugs also cause metabolic illnesses. They cause diabetes, obesity, also heart conditions like LongQT which is potentially fatal etc
The drugs diminish functioning and quality of life for many people who have been on these drugs for years. They are less capable of cognitively complex tasks which leads to a diminished ability to work or have paying and stimulating jobs IF they can even work at all. The nobel prize winning genius mathematician John Nash is a good example of this, he was only able to be functional again when he quit the prescribed drugs( they deliberately don't show this in the movie “ A beautiful mind” because there was too much political and financial pressure against letting viewers think they could get better by quitting the drugs- for the truth about John Nash and the drugs you can read his biography or watch interviews with him talking about it.)
On the drugs people tend to not have a libido nor have children which is not unintentional, psychiatric eugenics is real and has been around since before the Nazis implemented it-.look it up.
Many/ most psychiatrists withhold the truth about any real benefits and especially the real damages caused by the drugs they prescribe, sometimes they deliberately withhold or twist the truth and sometimes they don't know any better and just parrot lies they've been told by pharmaceutucal companies who makes a fortune off of pushing psychotropic drugs.
The reason why so many people believe that these drugs 'work’ is because of convenience. It's convenient to have a family member or friend or just member of society be sedated and dumbed down and disabled to the point they are complacent and controllable. And how convenient is it indeed, that one of the symptoms psychiatrists invented for schizophrenia is “anosognosia”( not having insight or the ability to perceive or accept or agree to the supposed“ fact”that one has schizophrenia) which makes it utterly impossible for a person diagnosed as such to ever be credible or validated or respected regarding what they say they are experiencing, what they need and what they want and it makes it very easy for them to be abused by forced damaging “ treatment”.
The system is rigged to cripple, hide away, control people with schizophrenia and other psych diagnoses, as is evidenced by the human rights violating “ laws” that apply only to people with mental illness diagnoses, not to anyone else not even rapists or mass murderers.
All this is also perpetuated by the lies the public hears which claim that people with schizophrenia are dangerous, when in fact they are no more dangerous than anyone else and they are in fact far more likely than the average person to be the victim of violence than the perpertrator.
It's also perpetuated by the lies claiming that people with schizophrenia suffer more off the drugs than on them and that they have no insight into what they're experiencing or need and that they are dumb and therefor need to be forcefully ‘protected’ from themselves.
All that being said, people diagnosed with schizophrenia definitely struggle with executive functioning,perceptual processing, overstimulation , difficulties with expression, high anxiety and difficulty managing stress and to top it off they often experience trauma and abuse leading to an increase of these symptoms.
Treatments that can help would revolve around psycho- social support and cognitive therapy. Drugs to calm/ sedate and even hospitalisation can be helpful or even necessary *short term* when someone is in an acute crisis and at risk of harming themselves or others during that time. Those drugs should only be used shortvterm, they should be decreased and then discontinued as soon as a person regains the ability to not be a danger to themselves or others at which point they should also have the option to either leave the hospital or to stay longer and get supportive therapy in the form of cognitive , psycho- social, creative therapies and shpuld also be supported for housing and education, vocational training and job placement and ongoing psycho- social support with regular check ins from a caring, respectful and supportive person once they are out of the hospital.
What happens in reality now, is a person in crisis gets violently and forcefully locked up and drugged for a few days to a max few weeks then gets sent out of the hospital/ psych ward ASAP fully drugged without having had any psycho-social or cognitive support/ therapy back into the situation they came from or worse which will lead to a quick increase in stress as well as high anxiety and confusion and an inability to work and get or maintain stable housing, psycho-social and medical support/ care…then they will also abruptly stop the drugs which leads to worse symptoms than if they had never taken the drugs....it’s a vicious cycle.
Sadly the drugs are often thought to be justified simply because a person has a different/ atypical way of perceiving reality which falls out of the main stream and is not actually harmful or damaging to anyone, yet it's treated as if it is under the pretence that it's “ pathological” even though there is no evidence of “ pathology” only of“ atypical uniqueness”. An atypical uniqueness which is “ undesired” because its not conducive to the economic/ political wealth of the society in which that person lives.
Some countries/ societies have far more humane “ treatment” in place which focus less on the use of drugs and more on psycho- social-vocational education/support/ integration . What in one society is regarded a pathology is regarded as just a unique mind with unique skills in others, skills that are supported and cultivated leading to a person being respected and valued as a member of society with something special to offer, eg “shamans” offering spiritual advice, enlightenment, healing...",schizophrenia
1321,"Because treatment for any mental illness is not perfect. You will take medications that won't work for years until you find one that does. You will spend the rest of your life taking those medications, and talking to a therapist all while just trying to be “normal”. You will want to be able to work, date, and have a family. But for too many with mental health issues that's not how it goes. Let alone someone with schizophrenia who is convinced medication is not a solution and won't do anything to do better to get to “normal”.
There also is no “cure” for schizophrenia. I will always struggle with it. Some days are eorse than others, but it's how I know the medication is working. I get “new days”. Not one bleeding into months of the same bs symptoms everyday. I will struggle with this everyday, for everyday of my life. You don't “shut it off” or “stop it”. That's not what mental health issues are. It means in the best times of your life, you only feel suffering. And the worst of times? Someone without, can only judge you.

1324,"Psychotropic drugs as antipsychotic medications reduce the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses, usually allowing a person to function more effectively and appropriately. Antipsychotic drugs are the best treatment for schizophrenia right now, but they don't cure schizophrenia or ensure that there will be no further psychotic episodes.
In rare cases along with the psychotropic drugs, psychotherapy is also given.",schizophrenia
1325,"Fairly ineffective- rest assured.
If the reason for seeking treatment is to make a person dependent and useless for the rest of their life, please continue the treatment.
But if the goal is recovery, please seek alternatives and remember that everyone who finally recovers goes off psychiatric medicines at some stage. This includes the likes of John Nash- please read about him on google if you don’t know about him and his story.",schizophrenia
1326,"Schizophrenia is a “real” mental health illness that is noted for both positive symptoms and negative symptoms. “Positive” symptoms do not mean that these symptoms are “good for you” per se. “Positive” symptoms simply mean that these symptoms are easily observed. They include hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations tend to be auditory in nature. People hear voices perceived to be coming from the outside, and not inside their heads. Usually, multiple voices are involved and can often be of both genders. Visual hallucinations are much more rare than auditory hallucinations. In terms of delusions, they tend to be persecutory or paranoid in nature, which are different than the grandiose delusions found in people suffering from a manic episode.
There are also “negative” symptoms of schizophrenia which include thought disorganization (where the person has trouble organizing his/her thoughts and as a result, when he/she speaks, it looks that the thoughts expressed are all over the place), amotivation, blunted affect (where the person’s facial expression is not as natural and not as wide-ranged as otherwise normally be), issues with concentration and memory problems.
Every person with schizophrenia may exhibit a different combination of the symptoms above. Therefore, there is some strong evidence behind that schizophrenia might not be such a homogenous illness as we traditionally believed to be. Instead the “category” of schizophrenia may contain subsets of conditions within that term. But that does not make the diagnosis not “real.”
In terms of treatment, the main treatment for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics or neuroleptics. There has been an explosion of treatment in the past 10–15 years, which is good becauee we now have a lot of choices.
The reason that having multiple choice is good is that everyone is different. I have seen cases where one does ok on risperidone (Risperdal), meaning 50% improved, but once switched to aripiprazole (Abilify), the improvement went to 75–80%! The opposite might be true for another person where aripiprazole (Abilify) just gives him/her agitation side effect without much relief, but once switched to risperidone (Risperdal), the person’s suffering goes down and finds the latter to be calming and toning down the voices.
In other words, only your physician can guide you to find the best treatment for your condition. Schizophrenia is now a very treatable condition.
As for if schizophrenia can be “cured,” I don’t like to use that word. Instead I like to say that with aggressive treatment and continuous effort on the part of the patients, schizophrenia can be controlled and can remain in remissions, so you can lead a long productive life.
In the field of medicine, we rarely “cure” anything, save cutting out the appendix if you have appendicitis, or eradicating your pneumonia by giving you the correct antibiotics. Otherwise, in medicine, we don’t “cure” sickle cell anemia, Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, migraine, hypertension, high cholesterol, etc. etc.
That list of conditions we don’t even promise to cure goes on and on, forever. However with proper medication management, along with diet and lifestyle changes, we can keep those medical conditions (schizophrenia included) at bay and lead a long, productive life.
But that does not mean there is no research done into curing various medical condition. Ultimately cure may lie in the use of genetic therapy which I am not very familiar with. You would probably need to alter one’s genes permanently (across all cells in the body, or at least in the brain) in order to “cure” various medical conditions. One way is to introduce genetic fragments into your cells by using a toned down virus as a “vehicle” to intentionally infect your body’s cells and inject man-made genetic materials to be incorporated into your cells’ DNA.",schizophrenia
1327,"Treatment consists of medications and therapy
Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, and coordinated specialty care services.
These are the second generation drugs that are used today for schizophrenia:
Aripiprazole (Abilify)
Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada)
Asenapine (Saphris)
Brexpiprazole (Rexulti)
Cariprazine (Vraylar)
Clozapine (Clozaril)
Iloperidone (Fanapt)
Lumateperonee (Caplyta)
Lurasidone (Latuda)
Olanzapine (Zyprexa)
Olanzapine/samidorphan (Lybalvi)
Paliperidone (Invega Sustenna)
Paliperidone palmitate (Invega Trinza)
Quetiapine (Seroquel)
Risperidone (Risperdal)
Ziprasidone (Geodon)",schizophrenia
1328,"Yes.
My mom has schizophrenia and she is scary as hell. She scares away anyone I hire to do anything around the house. I have had to lock my arms around her to prevent her from becoming overly aggressive with contractors hired to repair stuff. And even though she is almost 90 she can still grab my arms and give me bruises and try to force me to do her will.
Hey she can also do the extremely sweet old lady thing, if she wants to.
I don’t enjoy caring for her at all, but it is love to do the things that you do not “feel” like doing. I will likely have to work 10–15 more years to pay for her housing, utilities, food, etc. It is what it is.
For what it’s worth, she raised me, and also raised my brother’s children remarkably well. She does great with kids, it’s adults who spark her delusions.",schizophrenia
1329,"Do I look afraid here?
I’d trust that woman, Diantha Curley, with my life. And she’s had schizophrenia for 42 years.
Don’t stigmatize mental illness that way. There is no shame in it. It’s a chemical imbalance in someone’s brain that causes them to act irrational or delusional. A disability, nothing else. She takes medication for it and is a kind, loving woman who has been an honorably discharged soldier, a teacher, and holds two master’s degrees as the only one in her family who went to college. And she kicked cancer’s ass, and now she’s going to kick kidney failure’s ass, too.
We don’t need fear and stigmatization of the mentally ill in this country. We need better understanding and care of people who suffer from it. She’s lucky. Because she’s a veteran, she gets the care she needs. Not everyone is so fortunate, and even she’s had issues with her medical care before.
If we’re going to be a society with the right to bear arms, we have a societal responsibility to aggressively treat mental health issues. People with untreated mental illness are a danger to themselves and others, especially if they have access to deadly force. And even if they are not prone to such acts, it is inhuman to allow a person to wallow in the darkness of their mind when they can be like my friend here. And yeah, she’s amazing and not everyone can be her—but everyone should have the right to be the best they can be.",schizophrenia
1330,"We are much more likely to hurt ourselves before we hurt someone else. Yes, when we have episodes, it can be scary. I've been blamed for sending a couple of my old friend to therapy because they experienced an episode of mine. But not once did they ever feel like I was going to hurt them.
there are huge differences between a day to day schizophrenic and a manic schizophrenic. Day to day, we walk around and go about our lives just like anyone without it. Manic is a whole different story. It’s scary. Witnessing it, you’d be quite scared, but imagine how the person having it is feeling. We can’t stop it. Our minds have taken over. We are trapped in that terrifying heartbreaking moment until someone/something trusted snaps us out of it, or we hurt ourselves to bring reality back into play. Hurting ourselves sometimes grounds us. And that’s all we need. Is to feel grounded. The meds don’t always work. And when we get bad days where the voices do sneak back in, before we know it, we’re being convinced by those nasty voices to “skip tomorrow. You’ll be fine” and instead of letting the meds dull us down to absolutely nothing, we lose ourselves and sometimes it can be drastic.
But in the end, we’re just like anyone else. We just need a bit more patience from people AND ourselves so it can be difficult to speak with one of us and really get a feel on how we function.
I hope this helped you ❤️",schizophrenia
1331,"One of the closest friends I’ve ever had is a paranoid schizophrenic.
And there's no sugar coating it: the man can be dangerous without medication.

In his twenties, he carefully mowed the lawn at his mother's house, took the gas can after he was finished and emptied the contents into the living room.
After lighting a kitchen match and throwing it on the floor, he went out onto the front lawn and assumed the lotus position. When the fire department and police arrived, they assumed he had been injured in the conflagration.
They asked him what happened.

> “Well, first I mowed the lawn….”

Lenny was convinced his mother had been tampering with his brainwaves. If you've ever read any gang stalking content on Quora then you're familiar with his particular brand of delusional behavior.
I got to know him through his writing. Despite never having graduated from highschool, he was one of the most adept poets I've ever encountered. His work was featured in the Black American Literature Forum and praised by Nikki Giovanni.
When we first met he was still writing and still manic. I was going through my own personal difficultie...

1332,"This is my schizophrenic best friend, Shep, asleep on my chest when I visited him last week.
Terrifying, isn’t he?
Later that night, he read us a story and made sure we had a stuffie so that we could attempt to sleep. We didn’t sleep very well, but he did his best to facilitate rest and relaxation.
Schizophrenics aren’t terrifying, but the people who make broad assumptions definitely are.",schizophrenia
1333,"I have schizoprenia and I was violent once. I have been delusional and psychotic half my life. But not anymore. Now I am disabled because of it. In about 1997. I assaulted a Muslim at a mosque. I believed I had the Scorpion which was a kind of symbol representing guidance I was receiving from Allah. I could feel as disbelievers we're nearing me or getting further away like a Scorpion and its prey, so quite a few times I ended up in neighborhoods or hiding in people's backyards in extreme psychosis usually at night. I had the delusion that I was Jesus. Which was a belief I was developing ever since I became scizophrenic. I wasn't on any meds. I carried knives on me and since extreme guidance was called for in extreme times such as they were bringing the the Islamic faith in the new millenium as Jesus, the Scorpion was a recurring thing. When that was going on. I would say that I was dangerous. I do not have a violent nature but I was twisted by Islam and schizophrenia. So that night I assaulted a Muslim I was at my mosque..and I remember running around the mosque thinking I was the Scorpion and had some disbelieving Muslims trapped in the mosque as they could feel my movements as well. Out in front of the mosque a Muslim had his car window rolled down and believing that I was doing something important as jihad, I reached through his car window and started pummeling him in the face with my fist. Someone saw me running around the mosque earlier and called the police and I was arrested and taken to jail in psychosis. I was the first person to ever go through the diversion programme in Canada lucky for me. I am a white guy by the way and I am not a Muslim any more. I don't like religion I think it is a twisted way to think. But the schizophrenia definitely turned me into a dangerous psychotic Muslim. I am proof that schizophrenia when entertained and followed and believed is most certainly dangerous. But you have to remember. I was just a nice guy believing in his religion and his delusions. When psychotically Ill watch out. We are out there, but I think the chances of running into one are slim. Please upvote this if you think this is helpful., It means alot to me",schizophrenia
1334,"This is the stigma that people diagnosed with schizophrenia live with. A lot of schizophrenics are afraid to tell there closest friends that they suffer from schizophrenia. They fear that will lose those friends as soon as they find out.
Because of this stigma people diagnosed with schizophrenia often keep it to themselves. Schizophrenics are not to be feared. They need love, affection, and support. However, many of us seldom get it. Schizophrenics are human beings just like anyone else.
Schizophrenia is probably the most misunderstood and underrepresented disorder there is. In Schizophrenia causes people to percieve the world differently so in fact, they are the ones who are scared of you.
Schizophrenics are easy targets for people to take advantage of. It is a fact that schizophrenic are more likely to be victims of crime, abuse, and other advantageous people lack ethics and morals.
Schizophrenia is a disease of the mind. The mind is the thinking part of the soul. Therefore, it is a spiritual disease that needs a spiritual solution. Most research and funding goes into pharmacology. However, every psychiatrist will agree that medication can only manage symptoms at best.
Medications are ineffective for many schizophrenics. Medication is like spaying the flames of a fire instead of it's base to keep it from getting out of control. The disorder needs to be attacked on the spiritual level in order to cure this terrible ailment.
Schizophrenia can range from moderate symptoms to a living hell. It can be like a nightmare that you don't wake up from. You don't even get a break when you sleep, if you can sleep.
Don't fear schizophrenics, have compassion for them.",schizophrenia
1335,"Yes I do. That labels me “crazy.”
I get told a lot, “You don't seem like you have schizophrenia.” “You don't look like you have it.”
When I'm alone with my mind - is when it's the worst. If I'm not on meds? Forget it, It's just a downward spiral. Everyone's out to get me. What was that?? Omg, they are talking about me. Do I smell? Some of the agonizing thoughts I have daily. That's when I am taking my meds..
Now without them?(aka a psychosis) My family hates me. My daughter is going to forget me.. There are bugs everywhere in my house, in my hair, in my clothes, etc. *Buys bug foggers and lice shampoo* Falls into a deep depression. Lays on the couch for days at a time without eating or showering. *Cuts up furniture because people are inside it.* *Pulls outlets out from the walls because I'm being watched.*
To live with it? It's absolutely awful, every day is a struggle and being sober every day is a struggle. I'm fighting 2 demons at the same time but I refuse to let them win.
I came home this past weekend from a long-term rehab program. I got to see my wonderful daughter. When I'm with her everything is right in the world. I forget all about my schizophrenia and addiction. I am 4 1/2 months sober today.",schizophrenia
1336,"Dangerous is a strong word. It's unfair to put a label on a person because of the symptoms their disease causes. I believe untreated schizophrenia causes people to act in a way they normally wouldn't act. If their actions are a result of their illness and it causes bad things to happen, can you really consider the person “ dangerous” or should you consider the disease as “dangerous” ? You have to remember that the brain of someone with schizophrenia changes from before they developed the disease. They cannot be held responsible for that happening. Noone asks to have schizophrenia. It is a disease that we know very little about. For instance;
How a person gets schizophrenia?
Why does a person get schizophrenia ?
What are the symptoms ?
What medications help the symptoms?
Why is there different degrees of wellness?
Why does different methods help some and not others?
No two people with schizophrenia have the same symptoms , it varies each person. A medication that helps one may do nothing for the other.
But dangerous? No, not if you know what, how, when and why that person is behaving different and seek help immediately. Never give up on them. They need all the help they can get to battle this horrible disease. They may not act like it once they start having symptoms but they're not aware , so please get them help and don't stop until they are back to the person you knew before the disease.",schizophrenia
1337,"Most people who have schizophrenia are gentle, if somewhat confused. They can be guided, they can be agreeable. But they also have a mind of their own. They are not machines, they are not tools. They have feelings—however invalid you may think they are, and goals—however nonsensical they may seem to you—how would you like it if you were just going about your day and someone stepped in your way. For no apparent reason.
Remember they likely live in their own reality. They’re not concerned with the same things as you are. Unless you make yourself important, you will be ignored. This is not personal, you’re just an ant. We all have things that are important to us, our jobs our houses our cars our kids, things that this person may not have thought about in a very long time. Maybe they have a job that you don’t understand—after all nobody pays them. Maybe they live somewhere unconventional, drive an invisible car, and have kids they made with their mind. Actually talking with these people can get pretty interesting quickly.

1338,"I have one living in my house right now. He refuses treatment, and the voices are pretty much taking over his life.
I’m not scared OF him, but I’m scared FOR him. He’s done several things that, while they won’t kill him, certainly aren’t any good for him. Like eating two cans of raw Pillsbury biscuit dough. or not going to the bathroom until he absolutely cannot hold it.
My older son (the schizo’s best friend for 20+ years, since they were in Kindergarten) IS scared of him. He claims his friend has given him a “death stare” several times. Another friend of theirs, who has spent time in prison, is also scared that this kid is going to snap and kill one of us. He said he’d seen this exact behavior in prison and it always ended in violence.
Unfortunately, because he refuses treatment and hasn’t actually DONE anything violent yet, there’s nothing anyone can do for him. In-patient treatment (which is what he needs) is not easy to find here, especially if the patient refuses to cooperate to get his Medicaid insurance set up.",schizophrenia
1339,"Yes it is frightening, until you get the good experienced psychiatrist / doctor ASAP for immediate recovery. My elder brother (Age 26) had gone through this disease before four years ago, and we were all shocked what happened to him just in a blink as he was behaving normal just few moments ago, and now it was not him.
We soon consulted one psychiatrist to understand this mental situation even he didn’t get the disease and said that it is temporary brain shock may be due to over gaming and given few medicines, but no improvements.
We then approached one experienced doctor, and he declared it as a case of schizophrenia and made us aware about it and started recovery procedure. It took almost two years for complete recovery and today my brother is all good and doing well with all his daily activities.
Let me admit that the percentage of recovery process mainly depends on how earlier the diagnosis started by the good experienced doctor and emotional support from the family. The recovery process is too slow in this case but all we can do is to have patience and follow the instructions by the doctors.",schizophrenia
1340,"I had seen schizophernic patients wild paraniod schizophernic ones who is aggreseive, roars at night. Since they had a very imbalances in the brain their neuro function is staged for disruption
They display sleeplessness, restless nature, suddenly bursting out, shouting on family members etc they hear voices, they hallucinate but they are aware of the present so no need to worry
Only in the intial years of chornic stage they react but as years passby as they age things began to settle with medication and they start to recover behave with love even though the way they speak nod their heads talking to self all exist but its manageable",schizophrenia
1341,"no im not afraid of anyone/ any human. yes im aware with those who are experiencing schizophrenia and the voices/ temptations on their mind can urge/ tempt them to either harm themselves or others and on top of that thru the spiritual attachment they have that at times they can have supernatural strength etc, but still why would i be afraid of them. their human just like me and i understand/ know that they can be demonically influenced and manipulated to try and harm me but non “schizophrenics” can do the same thing and produce the same level of danger. i think its all about knowing and having awareness of the potential danger possibility of violence that can arise when the spirits that inhabit/ influence their mind trigger anger, rage and agitation with temptations to cause harm. now other then that again they are just like us and any human “schizophrenic” or not can be a threat/ cause violence/ harm to you and yes their is cases where total demonic possession takes place and without having any control, the spirits who take over the vessel completely in those cases where they murder a family member or whoever. but still as dangerous as that can be, being aware and knowing how to shut down that spirit and command/ rebuke it in the name of Jesus Christ will work every time as long as you are a true/ actual believer who has the authority that Jesus gives all Christians/ believers",schizophrenia
1342,"I'm not afraid of them. I had an ex and a friend who were schizophrenic. I worked with some too. I tried to put myself in their shoes, to view the world from their perspective. Help them to get help. Supportiveness works better than rejection. Empathy helps them to feel safe with you and likewise you feel safe around them.",schizophrenia
1343,"I struggle mostly with suspiciousness, which psychaitry instantly labels “paranoia” and sensory overload. I sense and believe that I’m surrounded, watched, sometimes followed by many people or other beings, I often feel crowded and prodded with sights, sounds and touches. It’s very overstimulating and overwhelming and I usually question where things are coming from, why they are targeting me or why nobody else can perceive or sense these things. It’s stressful and isolating, because nobody else seems to share these experiences. I sometimes startle badly(even causing me to pull muscles in my neck) due to sudden, unexpected and at times unidentifiable sounds or by sensing I’m being touched by whooshing air, insects or fingers. These “hallucinations”(which I don’t think are actually hallucinations) don’t really scare me and I can usually just brush them off in little time, but it doesn’t stop them from causing me to startle or experience sensory overload, which in turn can lead to feeling agitated and unable to tolerate anyone being around me or talking to me.
At times I think all these things are part of a plot to drive me crazy, like some type of psychological experiment is being conducted, testing how I respond and I think there may be an interest in me specifically, because I’m not a Homo Sapien(but another type of human) and I’m considered a threat because of my ability to perceive things that some powerful people wish to keep secret. I’m never certain of this theory, unable to prove it even to myself . It’s hard to wrap my head around just what is happening and why. In any case, I don’t think I’m mentally ill. The more I get labeled psychotic and paranoid or get locked up in psych wards, the more I suspect that of also being part of some plot or gaslighting scheme against me.
I know that some of what I sense, perceive and believe is, in the opinion of others a sign of “mental illness”, so I must constantly put a lot of effort into “seeming normal”, only talking about what others think is “normal”. It’s an exhausting and estranging effort, which is why I try to be alone as much as possible, it’s the only time I don’t have to “pretend to be normal”. It’s been really hard lately, because due to the pandemic, my teen is at home with me 24/7 and although we have a very good relationship, I can't get much needed space and time to be alone and be myself for a few hours . I hide many of my thoughts and experiences from my teen as well, not wanting to worry her . At least the pandemic’s social distancing means I don’t have to be around any other people, which is helpful, enabling me to keep my stress levels lower than usual. I’ve not been hospitalised in 8 months now, which is a long stretch for me.
Edit: it's now been about a whole year since my last hospitalisation and for the past couple of months I've been doing very well, feeling more relaxed and secure than I have in a long time. Probably because I've been able to spend so much time in my safe home with just my sweet teen, barely ever interacting directly with anyone else. The balance is delicate though, as soon as I am obligated or pressured to interact directly with others, my anxiety, suspiciousness, stress, agitation are exacerbated, though not as severaly as before. I've had a lot of time to let my nevous system recuperate and strengthen, increasing resilience. I hope once the pandemic social distancing measures are relaxed and I’m expected to interact more, I will not take a sharp turn for the worse. I've actually been applying and enrolling in training programs to hopefully be able to work again in the near future. Things are looking up for now.
Edit 2024; I moved to Spain with my now young adult child(who in the meantime has moved to France) and have been able to remain hospital-free for nearly 5 years. Over the past two years, I completed a memoir about my experiences with the mental health system. Now, I’m just waiting to hear back from publishers.
.
People say l look mostly “normal” , when I am around them put in the effort, like in this selfie(I’m terrible at making selfies and I won’t let anyone else photograph me anymore)
But they don’t see me like this(being detained on Golden gate Bridge during a “psychotic episode”
Here are some drawings I made just doodles or sketches I made

Edit:
I'm amazed at all the upvotes and the kind and encouraging comments people have offered in response to my answer, I usually don't get those with answers about having( being diagnosed with) schizophrenia. I think it helps when I post pics with my answers ;)
It has also encouraged me to put my experiences down on paper more again, so today I made some ink doodle paintings.

1344,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.

First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
1345,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.
A very dear friend. A gem of a person. Wish the best for him, wherever he may be now.",schizophrenia
1346,"Not at all; people who suffer from this are gravely misunderstood, because the disease itself isn't really able to be extensively studied, as most doctors agree that the cause of it occurs in the grey matter of the brain. And we know very, very little about that part.
Schizophrenics are actually more of a danger to themselves than others, and the ones who do have a violent episode, it was likely triggered by something or someone else. Or, if they have a very high level of the disease, and therefore have gotten to the point (unmedicated) where they see everyone as a threat.
These people need medication, counseling and a lot of support, but because it's such a stigmatized disease, they seldom get it.",schizophrenia

But I was never afraid of any of them. In fact, they seemed like real people to me. They were much more relatable than normal people. To me, normal people seem fake. The people who said they were schizophrenic seemed much more open and hone...

1348,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia

1350,"Meditation clears the mind and is useful in getting rid of fears and mental traps. Self observation and stillness help us control our primal urges and insecurities. However, to cure an illness like Schizophrenia, meditation should be combined with a purposeful routine.
Since mentally ill people are vulnerable when they lose a sense of purpose, we need a routine to stick to, which includes a healthy social interaction and exercise. Meditation is an aid in keeping the mind clean and free from troubles which can coop up to become bigger ones that lead to a negative episode.
So, yes, meditation, in my life, is helping cure my Schizophrenia.
EDIT: This older answer endorses my observations - Can schizophrenics learn how to meditate? If so, is it helpful in controlling symptoms?",schizophrenia
1351,"I worked with and lived with a man with schizophrenia. I learned that on his bad days he was lost within his mind, hardly aware of other people and caught up heavily in his thoughts. He would have ideas for projects that were a bit zany and be focused on completing them - quite unaware of the bigger picture of his day, meals, showers etc.
When he was in a better state of mind, probably due to help from his meds, he was a bit more able to dialogue and interact with people around him, talk with others and so forth.
Meditation might help people with schizophrenia but it would depend on the severity. The person I was working with had it pretty bad. The individual would have to be interested in doing meditation and also not be using it as the only tool to deal with their particular mental challenge.
On the other hand, if the affects of schizophrenia were on the low side and the person was dedicated to creating a holistic approach to their challenge, incorporating a sitting practice with consistency and regularity, I would say ‘yes’, it would be helpful. Curing it, I don’t know. Treating it, sure.
For those on the more severe side of the scale I would say it wouldn’t hurt to try but don’t put too much hope into it as though it would be a panacea.",schizophrenia
1352,"It depends on the intensity of schizophrenia.
If it is mild, then you are good on your own.
There is only one note of caution. You may not want to practice extreme forms of meditation that are being popularised everywhere.
If it is moderate, you still can meditate normally, but you need to be in regular touch with a Guru.
If it is chronic, your meditation must strictly be under the direct guidance of a Guru.
Meditation will surely help you manage the disease much better, and who knows, if Grace glances on you, you may even stumble on awareness.
If you do, then you would say, ‘Haha.. the mind is schizophrenic, but I am not this mind. I, as awareness am just witnessing the fun.’
All the best! Jai Guru!",schizophrenia
1353,"This is one area where meditation could be helpful, but one must be careful. If the disorder is well-established then meditation should ONLY be done under the supervision of a professional psychologist, as well as a professionally trained and certified meditation instructor with lots of experience teaching. If a meditation instructor doesn’t ask if you’ve had any psychological problems or whether you’re taking any prescriptions before instruction in meditation, then that isn’t a responsible instructor, or the meditation technique isn’t much of a powerful technique.
Psychological disorders are rooted in abnormal structural and functional workings of the brain. Because the body and mind are intimately connected, these brain abnormalities distort the mind in ways that just aren’t healthy. There are various external contributing causes such as pollution, disrupted microbiome, toxic relationships, etc. that should be identified and eliminated. But eliminating external causes alone won’t necessarily undo the disruptions to brain function.
Most people are not aware how important rest is to the brain. For instance, deep sleep is when the brain cleans out all the metabolic trash from the previous day’s activities. Not getting plenty of deep sleep can actually trigger psychotic episodes which can become permanent. Imagine if your neighborhood no longer had regular trash pickup. It just piles up and gets in the way. Traffic slows down, toxic gunk festers, diseases ensue.
Meditation could help correcting the structural and functional abnormalities of the brain, especially if it helps to give the brain a deep rest by calming down thinking naturally (effortlessly). Studies have shown that meditation that calms the mind’s activity can have a remarkably restorative effect on the brain, particularly if the meditation technique produces Alpha1 EEG brainwaves over the entire brain. But not all meditation techniques produce an abundance of Alpha1 brainwaves. The amygdala usually needs to be calmed also. Meditation should increase vitality and energy, and strengthen mental coherence during activity.
Meditation can be much better for the brain than the psychoactive chemicals in drugs that do not normally exist in the brain and are typically designed to only prevent symptoms, but cannot promote the natural complex functioning. This is why many patients find they have “side effects” from psychoactive drugs which should be properly called just “effects” that people instinctively feel are not good. For example, dullness, a “drugged” feeling from a drug is not natural.
NOTE: Lithium is a naturally occurring element often prescribed for schizophrenia as a supplement, meaning it is to correct a nutritional deficiency in the brain, so it is important to take if prescribed. The brain needs enough lithium to world correctly. Take as directed for best results.
Meditation can be a very powerful agent for change in the brain. This is perfectly natural and as it should be — something needs to change to correct imbalances and abnormalities. Nature is given the chance during meditation to correct whatever isn’t working right. But if the mind is too weak to maintain a sufficient level of stability — “holding yourself together” amidst the changes that meditation bring — it can unleash an uncontrollable flood of changes, even if they are normally good changes. Too many changes at once that the mind simply can’t “digest” fast enough can become overwhelming.
Meditation’s effects are like stronger winds on the ocean which can be good or bad for sailing, depending on the sailor’s awareness of the wind conditions and ability to utilize and adapt the sails. One can take advantage and go fast, another can be overwhelmed and capsize, all from the same winds of change.
So my advice is, anyone with a significant mental disorder that is close to the edge of losing willful control, DON’T do any meditation except with the knowledge and under the care of a professional psychologist. The psychologist doesn’t need to be (and probably won’t be) a meditation teacher, but should be well-informed about what kind of meditation is being practiced and be in contact with the meditation teacher in case the patient’s thinking and behavioral direction from the changes that meditating brings are not the right direction. Meditation should bring more happiness inside, more relief from anxiety, depression, negative emotions.
If you can’t or don’t know how to trim your sails as the winds of change shift and gust, you could sink. Learn ONLY from a professionally trained and experienced teacher. ONLY a trained experienced teacher will be able to guide you correctly and know what to do if something is not right about the results of meditation.
Proceed on the side of safety with meditation, step into it gently, but regularly, so you won’t end up sorry. If it feels like stability of the mind is getting less, back off! You may need to chop some wood or other exercise to get “grounded.” Plenty of exercise is a good idea anyway.",schizophrenia

I meditate every morning, and it is the most important thing I do to help in my recovery from mental illness. I also take my medicine daily as prescribed.
Meditation gives me a calm core that I can always return to when my mind is not behaving like it should.
I suggest you try some guided visualization meditations. You can find them on YouTube. They are a way to help calm your mind without being difficult like some traditional meditation practices can seem to a beginner.
Your fear of losing your mind is completely natural. Feeling fearful after receiving your diagnosis is also completely natural. Talk to your doctor. If you have a therapist, talk to them as well. Tell them your fear. They can give you information about the disease that will help you feel better.

Meditation helps a lot to any schizophrenic person to recover back from the mental illnesses and live a normal life of a normal human being.
Meditation doesn’t asks for to take any sort of medications for the mental sicknesses as Schizophrenia, but to concentrate on self and relate life with present and reality to achieve the peacefulness required to stop the mind think of any unnecessary thoughts and imaginations, which then increases the chances of getting recovered from serious problems of Schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1359,"Neither are effective at treating schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a ‘disorder’, generally associated with, disassociative behavior or a personality disorder. As a result, the patient believes he/she is some other person or that they are in another time, place, etc… than their current or present environment.
Medication, effectually ‘disconnects’, neurological transmitters in the brain and incapacitates the patient, while meditation, is simply an search for interpeace. Neither help with schizophrenia, because the patient, does not know how to relate to or deal with, their environment, their surroundings, etc.. as the person or individual, which they are or have become, and as a result, they seek an ‘escape’ through the form of the manifest illness. Generally, it is the result of some kind of trauma, where there has been an effectually ‘break’ in the personality or identity of the individual and as a result, the see themselves as someone, other than the person, whom they are or have become.
There are many different kinds of mental illness, each with their own symptoms and each manifest slightly different, however to be perfectly clear, ‘THERE IS NO MENTAL DISORDER, WHICH MEDICATION CAN CURE’. It is not an illness, like a virus or flu, it is a disorder, which the person, does not relate to reality and they believe themselves to be someone entirely different.
Problem is, there are many things which perpetuate mental disorders, mental defective disorders, mental illnesses, etc… Popular culture is one of these things, the promotion of drugs, sex, violence, criminal behavior, homosexuality, gender confusion, etc… are all nothing more than trappings for very serious mental disorders, all of which can manifest in any number of ways. Country music for example is nothing more than a trapping for depression, anxiety, alcoholism, drug use, the inability to cope with life or ineffective coping, and the list goes on and on….. Rap music, it too causes problems between races, between Society and it’s members, between the Law and the criminal, poor parenting, absent parenting, etc….. Rock and Roll, it promotes substance abuse, chemical dependency, transmission of sexually transmitted diseases ( as does Rap music culture), broken homes, criminal activity, organized crime/corruption ( as does Rap music), etc….
Mental illness is everywhere and more present than most care to believe, especially in modern society. The corruption in Politics is an example of mental defective disorders and ultimately what you end up with is the criminally insane, who lack the moral or social fortitude to perform their task demanded of them.
The list is long, but seriously, what addict or addiction or dependency to substances, both legal and or illegal, have you ever known, has been good for the overall personality of the individual? It is the pseudo effect, the ‘buying into’ the concept or delusion of, some false hope, imagery, identity, etc…..
Islam, where the men are all named Mohammed, some may question is perhaps, a form of schizophrenia, how they all seek to identify with the prophet. Then again, some could view it as a uniform, however few Muslims are portrayed as being, Pillars of the community, however that is another story.
Some would question, if individuals who participate in any time of crime, if in some way, the mental lapse, no matter the offense, is not an illness or mental illness, of some kind? “The Having gone astray”, to a certain extent, is mental defective disorder and that, again is what the Psychological world, refers to as illness.
People who are frequently inapt in mental studies, trying to play Psychologist, is much akin to, someone who does not know a language, trying to speak fluently. It very seldom is what occurs. Medication, well that is just like trying to dumb down the audience with alcohol or drugs, to make this person, sound to be more knowledgeable about the mind. The mind is very complex and requires extensive training to become developed and fact is, few people have put forth the effort to be knowledgeable about mental health and or to be, mentally and or socially behaviorally healthy.
Fact is, all things in the world, are against mental and or spiritual health, including Religion, believe it or not. Because, Religion demands devotees, moreso than the rigors of study and observance and because of this, it can become, just as much, if not moreso a disorder, than that of a faithless society. Lent is the best example of this, you know, Marti Gras, Fat Tuesday, etc.. DISORDER, Chaos, Sin……….. Mental defective disorder……… So how many ‘Good Catholics’ do you know?
Point is, drugs can help if a person is manic or have anxiety disorders, I would limit their use, if used at all, because they are nothing more than a gateway to dependency, because people never learn how to overcome anxiety and relate to people, normally, without them. These drugs, effectually become a mask, they hide behind, the user that is. Same is the case with narcotics users, they often use drugs, to belong to a group or crowd and often, they want others to identify them as drug users, thus their identity is effectually one of a sickness, of an addict, more or less, which again, is simply a form or type of schizophrenia, as it means that they are masking their true self, with a false identity or false positive self.

Physical exercises (specially in the open) and yoga-exercises will surely help physically, and as a result the seriousness of the mental problems may lessen; but serious meditation like Vipassana where in the retreats total segregation and silence are must may cause serious aggravation resulting in grave situations for such patients. Serious meditations require the student to have a sound mind with a sound body. I would strongly suggest to consult the psychiatrist under whom the patient is at present being treated before taking such decisions like joining a serious meditation retreat/ course where silence and segregation are observed. Please be careful.

1363,"As someone living with schizophrenia, I surprisingly find it very difficult to answer this question. So instead I’ll tell you how my thinking changed. Keep in mind, I’m living deep in psychosis currently, so take it all with a grain of salt.
Before my diagnosis I remember loving and caring about my family. I remember feeling cared and loved for, even when people were hurting me, however I figured that they weren’t much older than me, and are only human. I forgave and could take a joke at my expense without giving it a second thought.
Before my diagnosis, but when I was certainly developing it: Everyone was a criminal to me. I was better than all of them, I was special, I was smarter, etc. Despite thinking everyone else was a criminal and looking down on them for their evil doings (which were nowhere to be found), I was the bees knees right, so I would break the law every time I knew I wouldn’t get caught. Grandiose, delusions of percussion, hard hallucinations, etc..
Now I’ve been diagnosed for three years. It’s hard to self-analyze. For me though, as a first person description I would just say the following: I’ve gone down the rabbit hole, more and more every week or so. I look back and would cry, but the APs make it impossible to do so, longing for how two weeks ago ‘boy, i was more normal then’. I hate my family. Only because I think they are going to get me locked up or hate me to some degree. They sit at home and plot against me. Now I look at myself as so stupid because I can’t keep up with what anyone says, I’m on too high alert, too anxious to think.

1364,"I’ve always thought my hallucinations are ghosts. So I use to say “I see different types of ghosts” lol.. but so, I have a couple different “style” of things I see. I’ll go from not scary- to super scary. First, the things I see most, are small “glitches”.. like bleeding colors or things will get like a electronic wave type look going on. Then I see quickly.. like pass by quickly but not really get a good look. And it’s not “out of the corner of my eye” type thing. I can be looking directly at it but it will just hide behind things and dart out quickly like it doesn’t want me to see it. And sometimes I see “ghosts” (they’re always people and sometimes domesticated animals like dogs) that I know really aren’t there. Idk how to explain it but there’s something about them that I just know aren’t real. Idk if they’re see thru or what. BUT.. the scariest things I hallucinate are the shadow people. (It’s not always people)… these hallucinations are fucking terrifying for a couple reasons. 1, even if I look directly at it and even walk right up to it, I can’t make it out. It looks like how something does when it’s shadow and yu can’t quite see all the details. Just that makes me feel sick. I know I’m looking straight at something and out of all the information my brain has collected in 32 years, it can’t make sense of this thing that’s right in front of it. These are also the scariest because they move and will interact with me. (The others seem to want to hide from me.. these want to scare me).
I’ve been “in contact” with (idk how else to say that lol) these three specific beings that visit me often, for about 20 years now. They haunt me. I’m an artist and was in art school when they were at their worst and all of my art from the time have the three figures in it.",schizophrenia
1365,"It’s pretty good actually if you could almost imagine drapeing yourself with your energy to create a shield, sometimes you can really block out voices, but the voices are relentless, you have to switch up your game or you get a painful tactile hallucination and it just stops working, combineing it with prayer is most effective you can use energy from different parts of your body to kind of drape your self and keep away what’s perceived to be bad energy… my thing was it was working for me, and I got really bad tactile halucinations and it never worked again, but y’know it seems to be working good sometimes it seems like the lowest chakras are actaully the most powerful to work with as far as utilizing your own energy. Sometimes though, you have a tactile hallucination” of the chakra area, your meditating with as becoming polluted with negative energy, which distroys the efficacy of the the result, where I’m christian and even some time Crom Cruach … I’ll say a prayer, for my chakra to be kept clear so I can use it without spreading around negative energy all over myself. So chakras are cool, in my opinion often the lowest one is actually the most powerful, but trying to go at it without prayer help can be pretty exhausting, expesially if you already feel under siege and the purpose of the meditation is respite. However, it really does have to be said about meditation that once you find something that works, if your playing with energies, that takes a lot of energy to maintain, so, if you can pray to hold those energies in place to something, you can reap the rewards and actually be able to focus on other things while reaping the benifit of meditation simultaneously. Sometimes you get good results it just seems like it rarely last, or whatever is so desperate to be at the forefront of your mind always finds a way back in, I guess even if it does work some of the time it’s worth it though.
think of it like imagine your baptism worked, or imagine your soul is blessed, and you don’t hear it unless it’s in contact with you, but if you touch it with your soul, it’s like it move away or really hates it when you touch it with your soul. So if it’s in contact with you and you touch it with your soul you won’t hear it, but where it’s inconsistant is how it just ups it’s game every time you think you have a handle on it. I found I had better luck trying to use more than one “chakra area” at once. It’s like your soul is possessed however the spirit and soul are not twin conscious, so you actually kind of have to mend to your soul, maybe there is a chakra area in which your soul enters you , imagine your soul as a gift from god, to be utilized, however, anyway, it’s like different chakra” areas” have different power one might be the general area in which your soul. Think of your chakras as becoming polluted” by what makes you hear a voice, you use one chakra, it gets polluted, it catches on and you have to keep switching it up, wherever you point of focus is is where the “demon” is so if you project your focus to the other side of the room the demon will be over there looking at it it’s where your point of focus is, it’s an illusion that that’s your head specifically so the other chakras may be handy, or the one that is polluted”. Imagine your soul and spirit as not twin conscious, and your spirit being your awareness… well imagine your soul gets in trouble and it gets possessed but your spirit can’t figure out what the hells going on because the two aren’t actually twin conscious, add in a multiverse, does your soul become your own pariah if it gets possessed unknowingly and unable to detect your spirit (awareness). Y’know “chakras” some Russians say “pray with your heart” might be food for thought? It might just be that your soul and spirit are not twin conscious, and the soul can play tricks… nothing demonic at all, it’s just the ba, can get the upper hand if the ka, lets it gaurd down, so, your soul as a seperate(?) conscious, over sees your awareness and plays tricks, maybe it’s trying to teach you something, my theory on why satanic bands start to suck after a while is that the ka is inspired, creates fame, then the ba want that for itself they trade place the band starts to suck… and the ka becomes like dorthy from the wizard of oz. edit, use the heart chakra to shut or block the third eye for voices, imagine the third i is like a light house becon for spirits then take your heart chakra, and use its energy to block your third eye and general head area, and the voices might get better, yes open third eye but how to shut? The best thing I’ve found so far is using the heart chakra to block the third eye. This works best on your back rather than cross legged, if your standing up, you need ridiculously good posture for it to work, stick your chest out in the air, and the meditation will work better. But I’d recommend being on your back and heart energy to the center of the forehead. Edit. Also meditation is like a game of chase away from your tactile hallucination, move your point of focus away from your tactile hallucination and you don’t hear it until the tactile hallucination comes around the new point of focus , say a prayer to not have tactile hallucinations and you might not have to play the game of chase",schizophrenia
1366,"Meditation/ mediation. If you hear voices talk to them respectfully. Prophecy is a deeply respected spiritual gift, but in certain contexts it gets confused for schizophrenia, even by trained professionals.
If you encounter voices that do not seem to have an audible component or simply come from nowhere in particular try to remain calm. This is often a great and undervalued blessing. The ability to have two-way communication with God is deeply valued by knowledgeable Christians.
Now one needs to understand what kind of voices one is working with. If you ask them about Jesus you will find the answer to be revealing. Prophecy will speak the truth about Jesus as revealed in scripture. False-prophecy is unfortunate but can be dealt with. The gift of tongues, which is most easily recognizable by its use of foreign language or word salad. There is also true schizophrenia though it is arguable if there is a reliable method of diagnosing that.
Prophecy is useful for knowledge. A person with the spirit of prophecy can ask questions of God and get answers in real time. It is indisputably the most valuable of the spiritual gifts.
The gift of tongues requires greater understanding to make much use of. It tends to be poorly understood. Anyone who has this gift is advised to pray for greater understanding. The gift of understanding is also called the gift of interpretation. This gift translates tongues and makes it effectively prophecy. (See Prophecy above)
False-prophecy is a sad condition, but can be dealt with by prayer.This kind of voice can be disparaging and hostile. It is recommended that the afflicted call upon Jesus to save them from this situation. Prayer circles are also helpful.",schizophrenia

1370,"No, meditation cannot cause Schizophrenia.
The start of Schizophrenia is with anxiety, depression, etc. The family members apathy is the cause why it reaches the stage of Schizophrenia.
Balancing the mind is important, not overdoing anything is important. Read below:
Anxiety and Depression is end result of thinking negatively. It means that the body has been tuned to this state by days, weeks, months and in severe cases years of negative thinking pattern. A 360 degree change of thinking pattern is the need of the hour but it is not easier than said. Human Being are not born depressed. These are not obtained from genes. It is the belief that one has acculmulated based on their toxic beliefs and thinking patterns about themselves and other people. When this false belief is untrained, you are CURED.

Anxiety and depression is the fruit of negative thinking pattern which gets embedded in the subconscious mind like the hard disk of your computer. Question: Does you computer open negative.docx when you click on positive.docx, you will say a big NO. Same way, what you feed over weeks, months and years, the same is reflected and projected by your subconscous mind. So you need to change your thinking pattern.

For most majority of patient’s, without doctor’s intervention it is not possible to cure anxiety and depression. Also not possible to cure with Modern Medicine if it is in advanced stage. Also.

The best option is Homeopathy or other alternatives like Ayurveda which cure the cause but but you really need to be lucky and make serious efforts to locate a doctor who knows his medicine because if the doctor doesnt know his medicine it can escalate the depression. Doctors you will find a many but a doctor who knows his medicine very few.

Anxiety, Depression, Anger, fear of failure, stress due to various health issues, getting upset at the drop of the hat, apathy, general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, mood swings, or sadness, early awakening, excess sleepiness, insomnia, or restless sleep, agitation, excessive crying, irritability, or social isolation, repeatedly going over thoughts, excessive hunger, fatigue, loss of appetite or gorging in food withoit being hungry, or restlessness, means your thinking pattern needs an OVERHAUL. It’s time to go to the mechanics of the mind. No, it is not possible without help for 99.9%. Quora is not the place to get help, here you can only get tips.

Read the book by Bruce Lipton - Biology of Belief.

If you need to really get in touch with a Doctor who knows his medicine just write after reading above book.

No one can be 100% the way you want to be but yes, you can be 100% the way you want to be

1371,"Since I have been diagnosed as far back as 1999 when I was 32 I am best able to answer this in my own personal tunnel. “WE"" can be completely normal when on our medication. The media tends to depict us as scary crazy unpredictable people you shouldn't be around. But if you take medication & see a therapist to help you smooth out some rough patches those instances are rare.
Without my medication of Abilify & Prozac I hear the voice of my long dead parents. And they say the most awful of things. Time when out loud you scream SHUT UP!! to those voices. Fear & anxiety. Every new face is a danger. Even the tiniest of problems feels like a mountain. Example…no metro card to get on the bus. Or the grocery store being out of canned chicken for my lunch.

Highs & lows.",schizophrenia
1372,"Q: What exactly causes people with schizophrenia to become so paranoid?
A: So, we don’t know exactly why schizophrenia happens. However, for people with schizophrenia who experience paranoia (not all do), I would say it is because they are responding to very frightening thoughts (delusions) or hallucinations (not everyone with schizophrenia has hallucinations though).
In my case, when I’m unmedicated I have a ton of delusions. Delusions are false beliefs; but not just regular false beliefs. The thoughts are often bizarre and frightening. Imagine for a minute that you actually believe that someone is just outside the door and they are going to kill you. You would be very scared and behave differently and say and do things that are out of the ordinary. I have had delusions before where I thought people were trying to kill me. It is intensely frightening. For the person with schizophrenia it is real.
I’d say for me personally, there were stages when I could talk myself out of behaving strangely, but then when things got really bad (without meds) it got to the point where I just automatically believed the delusions and became really paranoid. A lot of times I literally thought people were going to kill me. So, the person with schizophrenia who is experiencing paranoia is really just reacting to their thoughts (delusions) or things they might be seeing/hearing/etc (hallucinations).",schizophrenia
1373,"No one knows for certain, but it seems to have something to do with Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that affects our ability to interact with the world around us. An imbalance of Dopamine can cause hallucinations and delusions. Drugs that work with Dopamine can alleviate these symptoms. Why Schizophrenia happens is unclear but research shows a connection with hereditary and environmental factors. Someone who has Schizophrenia in their family and certain trauma or stress are more likely to develop Schizophrenia. When I worked for a state mental health center, I had to review the records for documentation requirements. Naturally, I read the patients’ histories. I'm no scientist, but I could see a pattern. Many of the patients had relatives with severe mental illness and severe trauma during their childhood years. My understanding is that the patterns can be seen in family history, but thus far we have been unable to locate any genetic markers that carry Schizophrenia or other mental illness. Nor has any lab test or imaging found a consistent connection..In my opinion, it is just a matter of time. Someday we will have the technology to show evidence in brain activity and genetics that can be demonstrated. I personally have a long history of depression and anxiety, I know it's real because I experience it.",schizophrenia

1375,"The exact cause of paranoid schizophrenia is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurochemical factors. Some potential causes include:
1. Genetics: People with a family history of schizophrenia have a higher risk of developing the disorder. However, having a family member with schizophrenia does not necessarily mean that a person will develop it.
2. Environmental factors: Certain environmental factors, such as exposure to viruses or malnutrition during pregnancy, may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.
3. Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain brain chemicals, such as dopamine and serotonin, have been linked to the development of schizophrenia.
4. Traumatic experiences: Traumatic experiences, such as childhood abuse or neglect, may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.
Managing and coping with paranoid schizophrenia can be challenging, but it is possible with the right support and treatment. Some ways that people manage and cope with the disorder include:
1. Medication: Antipsychotic medication is the primary treatment for paranoid schizophrenia. These medications help to reduce the severity of symptoms and improve overall functioning.
2. Therapy: Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help individuals learn coping strategies and manage symptoms.
3. Support groups: Joining a support group can provide a sense of community and understanding for individuals living with paranoid schizophrenia.
4. Self-care: Practicing self-care, such as getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring joy, can help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.
5. Educating oneself: Learning about the disorder and understanding one's symptoms can help individuals feel more in control and empowered in managing their condition.
For someone living with paranoid schizophrenia, it is important to seek professional help and follow the treatment plan prescribed by a mental health professional. Additionally, it can be helpful to:
1. Build a support system: Surrounding oneself with supportive and understanding friends and family can make a significant difference in managing the disorder.
2. Communicate openly: It is essential to communicate openly and honestly with loved ones about one's condition and how they can support them.
3. Engage in healthy habits: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding drugs and alcohol, can help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.
4. Set realistic goals: Setting achievable goals can help individuals feel a sense of accomplishment and boost self-esteem.
5. Practice self-compassion: It is important to be kind and patient with oneself and recognize that managing a complex disorder like paranoid schizophrenia takes time and effort.
Overall, seeking professional help, educating oneself, building a support system, and practicing self-care are essential for managing and coping with paranoid schizophrenia. It is also crucial to remember that everyone's experience with the disorder is unique, and finding what works best for oneself may take time and patience.

1377,"Not all schizophrenics experience paranoia.
Paranoia is a symptom that schizophrenics can experience, along with delusions, hallucinations (visual and/or auditory delusions) disorganised thinking, unusual beliefs, depression, etc.
Paranoia is really just a particular type of delusion.
A schizophrenic may experience all of these symptoms, or just some of them.
What causes these symptoms? A malfunctioning brain that ‘misfires’ information.
For example, My relative is schizophrenic. When she was well I told her a funny story about a colleague who didn’t understand what an hermaphrodite was (intersex individual), and who mispronounced the word (hermy-afro-ditey) and made us all laugh. This led the conversation on to a story about a woman who was given the wrong child in hospital after giving birth (my mom was in the next bed to her). It was quickly resolved. My relative was laughing and joining in the conversation.
Weeks later she is ill again, and very delusional. She claims that she was born male and forced to be a girl, and also that she was swopped in hospital and that her parents were not her real parents. We scratched our heads wondering where this all came from until I remembered that conversation. Her brain had taken a recent memory of a conversation and appears to have stored parts of it as an old personal memory that she believes really happened.
So, paranoia could be something similar. Maybe a schizophrenic watches a film about someone being spied on, stalked or victimised. Their brain transposes that into a delusion that this is happening to them.
Delusions are very real to them. So, beliefs (like the one above) can make them very angry, and paranoia can cause them to be terrified.
It is a terrible illness.",schizophrenia
1378,"If someone convinced you that you were crazy you’d be paranoid too. There are several causes for what is called schizophrenia and they are all a bit different.
For some people schizophrenia is a misdiagnosed spiritual ability and calling it insanity is like shooting yourself in the foot. It is an offence against God and acquires the negative attention of Justice. This is what happened to my mom. She had the gift of tongues and that gift is often misunderstood. She spent decades suffering paranoid schizophrenia when she could have been home raising her kids.
For this reason I recommend that theists avoid atheistic counsellors when seeking counselling.
Some people are literally under spiritual attack. This is also something psychiatrist are of little help with. That said, they can assist with those who become a hazard to themselves and others.
Others have true schizophrenia which is caused by trauma. These are less likely to become paranoid as there are no hostilities taking place.",schizophrenia
1379,"Paranoia can stem from one or all or some of the following causes:
Excessive Physical verbal abuse between parents kr gaurdians as a child
Abandonment or neglect of a child by one or both parents
Parents / gaurdians use of alcohol and drugs while still a child
Parents divorce as a child
Death or loss of a loved one or more than one time too many as a child
Long term starvation/ malnutrition as a child
Prolonged use of psychoactive substances as a teen (Psilocybin, LSD, THC, Mescaline, MDMA, Meth etc)

1383,"To begin the answer, the ‘exact’ causative factor has not been found. However, the cause of psychosis has been explained on many theories which have been put together into a widely accepted concept called as 'biopsychosocial theory’.
One of the important biological contributor is the dopamine excess and serotonin excess in an individual with psychosis.
Next is the neural circuit involvement. The most commonly implicated circuit is the anterior cingulate basal ganglia thalamocortical circuit which leads to symptoms like delusions and hallucinations. Dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit underlies the production of primary negative symptoms.
Psychosocial theories involve Psychoanalytic theories, Learning theories, Double bind theories etc.",schizophrenia
1384,"As of yet there are only theories on what causes schizophrenia. There appears to be a genetic link though not always. There is treatment for it that includes medications and counseling working together that can ALLEVIATE the symptoms, but since there is no absolute known cause there is no real cure, it's a lifelong disease. Paranoia can be one of the symptoms of schizophrenia but not everyone who has schizophrenia has paranoia. For instance my husband had schizophrenia developed at the age of 27, it has shown up in every generation for as far back as they remember. Yet only my husband out of his parents four children developed schizophrenia. He also had one of the most common, though not experienced by all schizophrenia sufferers, symptoms that being paranoia. We had two boys, only our youngest has schizophrenia, he does not experience any paranoia. Every schizophrenia patient is different and it's only through therapy that their behaviors can be first seen then diagnosed. I'd also like to mention that most of the medications can lead to serious or fatal injuries. My husband died at 45, still very confused, lost, sad, and scared. My son is responding well to the therapy and medications but we've both accepted he most likely won't enjoy a lengthy life. This disease is truly terrible, you might ask why I'd have children with him…the simple fact is we were in our early twenties, his family hid the truth about mental disorders from him…we didn't know. My sons having lived through this never want to have children, and I think I'd be ok with that.",schizophrenia
1385,"Thanks for the A2A. I apologize for the delay in responding.
What makes it really challenging to deal with paranoid schizophrenia is the fact that it exaggerates normal and logical reasoning to a proportion that's crippling and dysfunctional. Unfortunately drugs don't help much in this regard. However understanding, acceptance and a resolve to observe while disengaged with paranoid thoughts might qualitatively reduce the amount of distress experienced.
By acknowledging that your paranoid state is exaggerated version of regular fears, you are already ahead. Considering this analogy might help. Imagine that you are traveling in a bus. This journey is very important to you and has to be made, even if at great price. It's an overnight trip and your co-passenger is extremely annoying, mean even. Despite trying your failure to shut this person up, you have to continue the journey. You would rather discontinue the journey if given a choice, but you can't because this journey is too important to you. Letting this annoying person ruin that is not what you want to do. So what do you do? Muster patience and start ignoring the provoking shoved your way. Now consider this bus as your mind, this journey as life's time-line, the annoying co-passenger as your paranoid thoughts and yourself as that awareness in you that knows what's right thing to do and what is going on. You don't have to beat or defeat the co-passenger (paranoid thoughts), you have to step back and ignore. With practice you will get better at ignoring. Seek therapy to help yourself learn better ignoring or dealing techniques. When you stop engaging your paranoid thoughts, keep them on standby by being indifferent to them, they will eventually lose significance. Fighting them will acknowledge them further in your head, give them the negative attention that will cause them to persist. Remember, what we resist, persists, as C. G Jung famously quoted.
Hope this helps!",schizophrenia
1386,"It is very hard not to feel paranoid when you are unable to distinguish what is real and what is not. It is extremely stressful and confusing. Since the hallucinations you would be experiencing during psychosis would seem so real to you, it is very hard to trust someone who keeps telling you they are not. In order for you to even consider the possibility the things you are perceiving are not real, you would have to trust the other person more than you trust yourself. I think it's the ever-increasing doubt you feel seeping in from everywhere that feeds the paranoia. Paranoia becomes the most severe at the point when you can no longer tell who to trust; including yourself.",schizophrenia
1387,"By getting stamped with that DSM label. Psychosis definitely exists, but some psychiatric researchers and professionals believe that schizophrenia and its negative expectations should not, that it is being used to label people who have a range of different problems with a stigmatizing and dehumanizing label.

Schizophrenia doesn’t exist. That’s the name of the website. With a reason.
That’s not something we’ve made up. It’s just plainly written in the DSM5. There it says that schizophrenia consists of a set of criteria that roughly describes a group of people so that psychiatrist can communicate with each other. The DSM5 explicitly warns that we shouldn’t think that we’re talking about an objective, fully established disease. That’s not possible, since the criteria for the diagnosis change with each revision of the DSM5 and each international classification system has its own criteria for schizophrenia. The criteria are apparently subject to quite some changes.”",schizophrenia

My mother was a very fearfull, dark and pessimistic woman.The homelife from the time before I entered grade school was not a place of joy but more of a frightening place for a very young mind, say age 5 or 6. My mother was very self centered,did not show physical affection to me,and she definitely was not a person I could go to for any sort of uplifting sense of security when I was growing up,again beginning about age 5. So I grew up, my developing personality reacting to an unpleasant home reality I could not escape from, and I slipped into delusions, I guess as an escape mechanism only I didn't think they were delusions. I am completely recovered,no more delusions. I was very fortunate to find a good clinical psychologist who understood the dynamic that caused my disorganized, confused,delusional behavior.

Daniel-Paul Schreber’s Memories of a nerve deseased man - the most famous paranoid schizophrenic of all times rights a diary journal about how he got better from his crises (but his theory is, of course, delusional and completely psychotic itselv - that is why it is ingenious and a fundamental reading to anyone in the mental health field);
Jacques Lacan’s The paranoic psychosis & its relationship with normal personality - the last greatest thesis of classical psychiatry, before Lacan became a psychoanalyst but still a great contribution to Psychoanalysis;
Freud’s Schreber Case - Freud interpreting the above cited book Memories of a nerve deseased man;
Freud’s A case of paranoia that contradicts the psychoanalytical theory of the desease - which in fact does not contradict at all!;

1392,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
1393,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
1394,"Thanks for the A2A.
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder for which pharmaceutical treatment is strongly recommended. There are actual neurobiological changes happening in the brain of a person suffering from schizophrenia. However, experts do not yet know what triggers or causes Schizophrenia for sure. Environment plays a huge role. Also there is another factor, it is called neuroplasticity. It refers to the brain’s ability to alter its biology (structure, chemical composition, synthesis of biomolecules) to adjust to its environment; this ability helps us to learn new skills and respond to our environment. This ability also makes the human brain ‘learn’ to be in disordered state.
So to answer the question, if a person has been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with schizophrenia and has never been on medication (that is, his/her brain has learned to be in the altered state characterized by schizophrenia), it could be very hard to for him/her to not have symptoms (remission) with only lifestyle changes. On the flip side, sometimes people with schizophrenia experience improvement and discontinue medication. This sudden change affects the brain harmfully, which was now used to suppressing symptoms by alteration in brain’s chemistry. So the symptoms may reappear and they get worse, not responding to the type of medication that had helped once. Guess why? The brain learned its way around the medication to slip back into schizophrenia.
I’m not saying medication is good for health; I’m well aware of their side effects. I’m saying medication can be an effective management strategy in severe disorders like schizophrenia. Just like diabetes is a condition, that need both medication and lifestyle changes, so does schizophrenia.
Often times in most mental disorders, the life of the patient is shadowed by treatment. They no longer feel themselves. Yet the alternative of not taking medication in schizophrenia is extreme behavioral problems, poor self-care, social withdrawal, not realizing they have a problem, possible threat to self and others, not able to distinguish between felt reality and actual reality - and acting on their suspicion or being extremely distressed by it. If medications make life with schizophrenia more manageable and lessen the threat of harm to self and others, it should be given a fair try before rejection at face value.
Hope this helps!",schizophrenia
1395,"To be completely frank, the problem with being off of medication isn't that there is a return of symptoms such as hallucinations or delusional thinking, it's the preconceived idea that people have concerning the efficacy of the meds we take. Some one told them that we were much benefiting from the drugs and without them, terrible things resulted. Thus, there's a veritable army of incredibly opinionated psuedo experts of a medical bent with poison in their minds for the invisible enemy we represent as untreated mentally ill.
Much like racism or any other well intentioned malignant psychology, it's the assumed duty of the poorly informed but well-intentioned quasi expert to remind us of the forgone facts, which evidently, we the schizophrenics seem to be unable to grasp effectively.
When referring to the “aid of medication “ I'm sure you must mean the cosmetic enhancements we enjoy in the minds of those around us who are reassured of our improvement by the suggestion of our treatment. It's analogous to a button with the word “better” written on it. Just push it, and everyone knows all will be well. Even though secretly we know it's plugged in to nothing. Never had been. But telling them it is brings instant improvement in you as they see it.
Magical.
I will confess that there is a percentage of people who will never be diagnosed with an actual pathology of known origin, who's idiopathic condition is treatable through medication, but after the decades of fruitless treatment still suffer it, they might have no option but medication. Yet one might wonder why not. Is there no alternative? An underlying condition to be treated? Maybe. But no one cares to look, I guess. I've never been asked, perversely it's far more financially lucrative to ignore the cause anyway.
Alas. Such is life. There have been some very good psychiatrists over the years. People of the sort that Carl Jung was, but there is a vast pool of ignorant if well-intentioned community. This loving mob will torture us with their treatments and deny it all the while, marginalizing our opinions and focusing on what we know is best for them.
Your treatment, schizophrenic.",schizophrenia
1396,"This is a REALLY fraught question. Antipsychotics are, for most patients, a godsend, but they can come with heavy side effects, so not everyone who could benefit from them will stay on them. And of course, they’ve only been around since the late 1950s.
I would say, some people have been able to MANAGE their schizophrenia without medications. RD Laing was both a schizophrenic and a psychiatrist; he was part of something called the “anti-psychiatry” movement which started in the mid-1960s. He still had hallucinations, but he was able to cope with them.
He’s worth googling, as is the “anti-psychiatry movement.”
Mind you, my dad was also schizophrenic, went off his meds, and decided to give up eating, a course of action he did not survive, so I’m pretty skeptical about that whole “no meds” business. If you do this, you’ll need a sympathetic therapist with a lot of experience.
Most important, you’ll need to listen to the people around you. If they say “hey, you are not doing well,” you will have to believe them, no matter how good you think you’re doing.
I (cautiously) wish you the best with this but remember it has the ability to go pear-shaped.
To answer the original question, no one “recovers” from schizophrenia - it’s a lifelong condition. One copes with it. With the right treatment, one can live a normal life, or close to it.",schizophrenia
1397,"Remission means the disappearance of the signs and symptoms of a disease. But what’s been labelled schizophrenia has never been proven to be a disease. There are no biomarkers used to make that diagnosis, no blood or urine tests, no brain scans. That’s why it’s listed in the DSM 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, a diagnostic tool published by the American Psychiatric Association) as a mental disorder, NOT a disease.
Can people who’ve been diagnosed with that label recover? Yes, and many have, even without medication. People like the late John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner whose struggle with schizophrenia inspired the Academy award-winning movie A Beautiful Mind. Unlike his character in the movie, he did recover without medication. So did psychologist and researcher Eleanor Longden, who gave a Ted Talk on the voices she heard, her unfortunate experiences with psychiatry, and her recovery:
Many of the people who do recover say they were able to, once they found hope.
Distinguished psychiatrists who are challenging the current stereotypes about schizophrenia include Dr. Jim van Os, Professor of Psychiatric Epidemiology and Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology at Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands, He is on the editorial board of several European and US psychiatric journals. Here is his Ted Talk:
But please keep in mind that it can be dangerous for a person to suddenly stop any psychiatric drug, because of the risk of chemical dependency. They would need to be carefully weaned off the drug with the support of a qualified professional if they both agree that it’s in their best interest.",schizophrenia
1398,"Difficult but a lot better than taking them. Much more functional, pleasure while hard to attain (due to anhedonia) is not a completely foreign concept as it is on antipsychotics. Life has some meaning again. No longer a slave to painful side effects nor sleeping away my whole life. Antipsychotics cause severe, permanent damage to the brain and other organs so if you’ve been on them in the past you will have extra struggles as you try to recover from this. Then there’s the psychosis, which is an agony of its own kind. While antipsychotics may reduce it in the short term, in the long term you’ll have less of it if you stay off them. Many people find they had psychosis while on antipsychotics, and also struggle with it while off them. Living with reoccurring psychosis is like living with an awful beast that keeps taking over you and trying to kill you. Lots of people will try to kill you too, or assault you and take advantage of you. People with schizophrenia, on or off antipsychotics, are extremely often victims of crime. And despite people with milder mental illnesses getting more social support when they disclose their illness, people with schizophrenia get shunned and ghosted when people learn of their illness. Stigma for this neurological disease has gotten even worse in the past twenty years. And don’t expect any help from any “health” service- not only will they force you to take harmful antipsychotics, but when you are having psychosis and actually need their help, the hospitals will refuse to admit you or do anything at all to help. We need better treatments for psychosis, treatments like CBD that is at least as effective as conventional antipsychotics while having virtually no side effects. Because no one should have to choose between having a life with psychosis, or a worthless life on antipsychotics. But to answer your question, if I only had those two options, I’d choose the life with psychosis.",schizophrenia
1399,"I don't know personally what's it like to experience schizophrenia but because I have been misdiagnosed with schizophrenia I do know what it's like to be a major tranquilizer drug user for 11 years so far. Major tranquilizers are sedatives they block the dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, and histamine communication pathways in the brain by stopping messages from the brain to the body with instructions for how the body must burn more energy to produce a physical feeling of curiosity, energy, happiness or excitement for example. Major tranquilizers zap your energy and leave you feeling tired which makes people feel unmotivated. People on major tranquilizers who have psychosis can find the medication relaxing as their body is no longer working at 100 percent. So as their body slows down their mind follows suit and this can be therapeutic for patients who have a good drug trip on major tranquilizer drugs. That means the drug user likes how the drug makes their body work so the drug gives them physical releaf which can give them an improved attitude to cope with psychosis symptoms. It should be up to each schizophrenia patient whether they use major tranquilizers or not. The individuals that major tranquilizers work for can benefit but it should be without the people that have bad drug experiences on major tranquilizers being literally poisoned beside them. Many people living with schizophrenia can live normal lives without major tranquilizer drugs especially if they have access to a good support network and or competent talk therapist. The only problem is finding a psychiatrist who understands the importance of listening to their patients living with schizophrenia",schizophrenia
1400,"With schizophrenia it's very difficult to lead a normal life .As far as medicine goes, I found it be absolutely worthless as it did nothing to stop the demonic voices that badgered n tormented me 24/7 365 with Severe panic attacks every night for ten of the 23+ years . I suffered unfathomably miserable torment as I was forced to have to focus on and hear the Demons powerful lies that would completely distract me DAY n night. They would even let me sleep. Every night for decades I would lay down to sleep n they wouldn't let me . They just kept lying n accusing me of heinous crimes I would never do but they were so powerful I would end up shaking and going into beyond miserable panic .No meds helped at All not even a little and Mental health doctors kept convincing me to take the various meds and I did hoping they may help this time around as I tried everything for about 8 years .all it did was make me gain weight 100lbs or more . And they always had a new medicine that was proven in trials to be effective Which was a scam ,they tried to keep me riding on their cash cow on the money making Mental health Marry - go- round. They never worked either. So I came to my senses n stop talking their bogus meds and it's taken me 3 yesrs of dieting to lose the weight which had caused several other health problems like LYMPHEDEMA,which was very painful and it looks exactly like the Game or Thrones Gray scale . This requires constant treatment and it almost killed me . I was infected n had to go to the hospital about 8 times in 2022–2023 . It got better when I lost the weight. This was my experience and I was never crazy just severely tormented. My schizophrenia IS a spiritual attack by the stinking Devil, it's real . I turned to God and things are more tolerable now but it's still debilitating n quite a struggle. If your using street drugs you'd better stop right now or your schizophrenia will in fact get worse n harder to deal with , maybe get as miserable as mine has been . I don't recommend schizophrenia meds but if you try them for a short period of time and they aren't working stop talking them right away and don't be deceived into think they may eventually work cause they won't. Forget about the new ones that they always seem to recommend when things aren't working its a money making scam actually. Now if you do find something that makes it more tolerable for you count you blessings but be honest with yourself and don't be wishful thinking, if they don't work quit them immediately. Schizophrenia is often a spiritual attack and you can't stop it or cure it with Medication. Get right with God on his terms n fully surrender to him , follow him ,obey him read his word daily n pray for his help. Spiritual warfare is what's Really going on in many cases. Jesus will eventually give you the victory but you may suffer for a very , very long time. Unfortunately most Mental health professionals are atheists n cannot understand spiritual warfare so they throw meds at the problem .",schizophrenia
1401,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
1402,"No. From what I have seen over 55 years, schizophrenia without medication tends to disrupt a person’s life in serious ways. There are people who have schizophrenia, have a first episode, and then have no symptoms for ten years or possibly even 12 years. If it really is schizophrenia, it will come back eventually. If it’s not schizophrenia, it might be psychotic episodes connected with bipolar mania, or a more temporary psychotic disorder. Schizophrenia is more of a persistent disorder and does tend to come back, even if there is a fairly long gap between a first episode and when symptoms settle in and become more persistent. A few people appear to have actual episodic schizophrenia, but with them, as time goes on, the episodes usually become more frequent.
Most people can’t ‘cope.’ That is because schizophrenia is a neurological disorder, not a lifestyle choice. Like all diseases, it has a ‘natural course’ it takes when the person refuses treatment, and that natural course is not pretty.",schizophrenia
1403,"Yes I do. That labels me “crazy.”
I get told a lot, “You don't seem like you have schizophrenia.” “You don't look like you have it.”
When I'm alone with my mind - is when it's the worst. If I'm not on meds? Forget it, It's just a downward spiral. Everyone's out to get me. What was that?? Omg, they are talking about me. Do I smell? Some of the agonizing thoughts I have daily. That's when I am taking my meds..
Now without them?(aka a psychosis) My family hates me. My daughter is going to forget me.. There are bugs everywhere in my house, in my hair, in my clothes, etc. *Buys bug foggers and lice shampoo* Falls into a deep depression. Lays on the couch for days at a time without eating or showering. *Cuts up furniture because people are inside it.* *Pulls outlets out from the walls because I'm being watched.*
To live with it? It's absolutely awful, every day is a struggle and being sober every day is a struggle. I'm fighting 2 demons at the same time but I refuse to let them win.

1404,"Surviving life untreated was impossible for me. I either was too sick to realize that I was sick and caused major disruptions in the world around me. Then there was the point of clarity that I realized I was sick and tried in various unsuccessful ways to commit suicide (I am no longer suicidal thanks to medication). Then medication allowed me to function enough to get some treatment. I do remember the days of drooling in the corner, wearing adult diapers. Sometimes I regret medication, but most days I am grateful for it. The force field around me is not as thick. Information gets through. I take and handle being told what to do. I take suggestions. I listen to what other people are saying. I communicate so most people can understand me. Reasonable functionality instead of unrelentless suffering and disorder is something that I will give all the compromise and hardships of medication access to my permission (not like I really have a choice, but that’s a different story)",schizophrenia
1405,"Its quite nice. I cant say the same for other people with the disorder since it's a spectrum and my pyschotic symptoms seem to only arise when i am under servere stress. My biggest problems with schizophrenia were rarely with hallucinations and delusions. Paranoia was affecting me negatively, but i have to give all credit where it is due: i struggled more with the Negative Symptoms ( specifically low/lack of motivation, innappropriate emotions, lack of feeling emotion, memory problems, and disorganized thoughts, im sure theres more but these were the biggest things for me).
When i finally got the correct diagnosis they put me on seroquel. I forgot what it initially did for me because I was in highschool and I tend to not remember things i don't feel are too important. I moved on to some others after i had complaints on seroquel. As time went on I noticed my negative symptoms getting worse, i wasnt sure what it was, I had just assumed my schizophrenia was progressing. I felt like a literal zombie, I would often call this feeling “a husk of who I used to be”. I felt like i had no personality due to my lack of thinking. When i finally made the conclusion it was my antipsychotics, i went off without my psychiatrists knowledge. I was scared he would admit me into the psych ward for that. Ever since, I've been happier. I'm in a low stress enviroment and feel like I've gotten back to being the person I was. I now take B12 and vitamin D3 to help with my negative symptoms.
If you are someone with schizophrenia asking this if you are thinking about going off youre medication, please think about these first:
Am I struggling with Positive symptoms or Negative symptoms more?
Do I know how to cope during a psychotic episode?
If you answers Positive (or both) and no to these, I would say do not do it. I know it's horrible what they're forcing schizophrenics to go through by taking these medications, but I would probably work out how to cope with psychosis first more than anything before you move on. You risk getting hospitalized and experimented with by the doctors and staff.",schizophrenia
1406,"Yes and no. If your symptoms are mild, you might be able to manage. But if you’ve got to the point where you’re sitting in a chair talking to a psychiatrist, your symptoms are probably not manageable anymore, and the best treatment for scitzophrenia is anti psychotic medication. I battled my bipolar for years without medication, and honestly it was horrible. I don’t have scitzophrenia but I do have psychotic episodes occasionally and it’s not something I want to have to deal with ever again. Not all medications work for everyone, and with antipsychotics, it can be a case of trial and error until you find one that manages your symptoms with minimal side affects.",schizophrenia
1407,"Not diagnosis-specific.
There is no “how it is to live as a schizophrenic”, whether in a state of constant drug-alteration, sober, or something in between. The pejorative label “schizophrenia” covers a lot of ground — many different kinds of experiences, and underlying physical and psychological dynamics. Two people with the same psychiatric diagnosis may have radically different experiences, views, abilities, and goals. There is nothing prescriptive or predictive about psychiatric concepts like “schizophrenia”.
This includes with regards to drug use — the label does not tell us what someone will experience in the future, how they will react to drugs or to drug non-use, or how someone can get to the kind of life they want to be living. There is no particular way “it is to live as a schizophrenic”, with or without chronic antipsychotic use. And there are any number of ways people can choose to live in either case, so all their personal distinctions and circumstances aren’t the only variables to consider.
If your question was whether people can be happy, healthy, functional, and have a great quality of life without drugs, the answer is almost always “yes!” However, that does not mean the same ideas and lifestyles will work for everyone, or that what works great for one person will surely be great for another as well. We see the same with antipsychotics — antipsychotics usually fail, and most patients find them more harmful than helpful, yet a few sing their praises and say they are a lifesaver.",schizophrenia

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can help individuals with schizophrenia better understand and manage their emotions, leading to improved symptom management and increased overall functioning. In addition to emotion regulation, the other core skills taught in DBT can also benefit individuals with schizophrenia.
Supportive therapy can help people challenge delusional beliefs and protect against relapse.

Life had been difficult and it is still now. In my childhood, I've seen people treated me differently. People would mock about my mother. My adolescent mind would get hurt badly.

But I've never seen my mother that way. I wondered how she looks like when she dresses well. Later I found some old photographs of her when illness didn't yet attack her. I saw an woman in those photographs who is so beautiful. Her eyes on those photographs looked so charming and happy. Will I ever be able to know that person?
I've seen my mother rebuking my father without any apparent reason. She is in her delusions, a kind of false perception of reality. Its hard to connect with such kind of person. Even hard to love. But I've seen my father loved her unconditionally and without any complain, she is the woman of our family.
Yes, family life was a total mess with mommy can't do her co-ordination properly. People would generally avoid visiting our home. My mother didn't tolerate other people to come to our home. Her delusions would get kicked on those moments. She thought, those people coming to our home are her enemy. We became socially isolated. It was hard to maintain social life. Well-wishers found it difficult to help us. People would have happy family days on festivals, we would have nothing left. I've passed so many gloomy days.
In the beginning of her illness, there were so many superstitious speculations. My grandmother thought, some evil spirit had possessed her daughter. She tried every kind exorcism to evict the spirit. It was all horrible to watch those rituals. As expected, all gone in vain. Later my mother was hospitalized as a mental patient. The correct treatment started there.

The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.
Update 15/11/14
Thank you all for the comments/upvotes, it did help me feel less alone. I still suffer from health issues but",schizophrenia
1413,"This is an extremely good question. I will lay out my personal experience without giving statistics, because even though I am one singular person, I believe this could help your question.
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia when I was 17 years old, or about, maybe 15 years of age. I had a major psychotic break when I was 20 years old that lasted for four years straight. I was not on meds at the time and during those four years I was refusing meds after being taken in for help. At my worst, when I was 21, I was catatonic for many months off and on, and had to be helped to eat, shower, and do many things. I was told by a local mental health authority that I would be unable to work, go to school, or just about anything for myself.
I want to fast forward to the last 3 years. I have found a good medication regimen for myself, personally, now. I still deal with daily hallucinations, delusions, and killer anxiety and depression. They haven’t completely gone away for me, but I learn to live with most of them at this point.
In the past three years, I have attained a position at a local mental health authority as a Peer Support Specialist helping those in a First Episode psychosis program. I have gotten engaged. I also maintain a regular blog called The Dopamine Flux, in which I write about mental health from the first-person perspective. I have people writing under me. I have two short poetry books out. I could go on and on, but I feel it would be irresponsible and in ill-taste to list any sort of continuation of achievements. Although, that is my life, and I wanted to directly and succinctly show that it is possible to live a life you dream of when you live with a severe mental illness. It really is. I truly believe that.
I really hope this had helped your curiosity and answered your question!",schizophrenia
1414,"Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic mental health condition which is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, language and behaviour. It includes hallucinations which can be auditory, visual or tactile in nature. A person affected by schizophrenia often harbours beliefs which are false in nature and exist in the form of delusions.
There may be disorganised speech, which maybe incoherent and/or irrelevant. A person experiences issues with emotions, in the form of a general apathy or a mismatch between real feelings and expression. There may be an inability to understand information and further problems with attention and focus.
A person experiencing negative symptoms may require additional help with managing everyday routine. One area which requires attention is self hygiene.Depending on the intensity of the illness, one is able to manage everyday functioning.
It is important to understand that it is a mental disorder which impairs overall functioning and therefore it is important to be well aware of how to deal with the illness as caregivers. For an individual experiencing schizophrenia, an effective treatment plan can be laid out to ensure that the symptoms are managed. As family members, support can be a pivotal element. Making sure that the medical treatment is followed up regularly can be advantageous.",schizophrenia
1415,"If you do not have schizophrenia, then yes. There are many aspects to this question.
People may insist someone has schizophrenia, when they are wrong. Even more frightening is the psychiatrist who might diagnose someone carelessly.
Even with this diagnosis, medication should be left up to the individual with the diagnosis.
My sister’s life was ruined by professionals and their medications.",schizophrenia
1416,"Yes. And there are cluster A PDs which are “schizophrenic- like”, but still very different. There are 3 clusters of PDs: A, B, and C.
Schizophrenia is a syndrome
A person can develop schizophrenia at anytime in their life. If a person doesn’t have a PD before 8yrs, they will never develop one.
Ptsd + a PD creates multiple identites. This is me.
I have early childhood s**ual abuse (PTSD) that prolonged and Borderline. Certain triggers are just different. They make me flip, and I become … my protector. I don’t completely black out, but I have no control. I am different completely, like the opposite, and it takes me some time to switch back. Sometimes a week or more. In this state, I am out for blood and I have nothing to lose. All I can do is stay away from ppl I love during these times. Back in the day they called schizophrenia split personality, so now its confusing. Trauma splits personality. Period. The stress changes you. The etiology of schizophrenia, thats known so far, is genetic predisposition, and high stress.",schizophrenia
1417,"I see no reason why not, as the two fall into completely different categories. This is kind of like asking if an object can be both blue in color and square in shape.
Schizophrenia is really a neurological disorder. It’s specifically caused by a chemical imbalance (i.e., too much dopamine) in the brain, resulting in psychosis. Anti-psychotic medication can help treat the condition by blocking dopamine receptors.
Borderline personality disorder, on the other hand, is, well, a personality disorder. Certain medications such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and anxiolytics (anti-anxiety meds) may help to alleviate the symptoms; however, when it comes to treating the cause, therapy is probably one’s best bet in that case.
In other words, there’s no question that schizophrenia is a matter of nature over nurture, and that’s why it’s relatively easy to treat with science. Personality disorders, on the other hand, are most likely a product of nurture, and that’s a therapist’s job to try to “cure,” I'm afraid.
So, yes, theoretically, you can inherit schizophrenia and develop borderline personality disorder.
Hope this helps.",schizophrenia
1418,"Yes. These are two distinct and distinctly different personality disorders, but many who suffer schizophrenia as their primary diagnosis also exhibit the characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder as well.
Let’s start logically- the definitions of the two disorders are distinctly different.
From Merriam Webster Online:
Definition of schizophrenia: 1 medical : a mental illness that is characterized by disturbances in thought (such as delusions), perception (such as hallucinations), and behavior (such as disorganized speech or catatonic behavior), by a loss of emotional responsiveness and extreme apathy, and by noticeable deterioration in the level of functioning in everyday life.
NOTE: Schizophrenia often involves an inability to orient oneself with reality, a withdrawal from social interactions, and a failure to integrate thoughts with emotions so that emotional expression is inappropriate. There are several subtypes of schizophrenia, including paranoid schizophrenia and those types marked by catatonia or hebephrenia.
Definition of borderline personality disorder: a disordered behavior pattern that has an onset during adolescence or early adulthood and that is marked by unstable, intense emotions and mood with symptoms including instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, fear of abandonment, and impulsive or unpredictable behavior:
“Like others with borderline personality disorder, she had intense and unstable relationships with people that veered from adoration to intense hatred and jealousy the moment she felt the merest slight.” — Richard A. Friedman
Borderline personality disorder afflicts an estimated 1.3 percent of U.S. adults.— Bruce Bower—abbreviation BPD
And as a side note,
I’ve wondered many times if the experience of suffering from schizophrenia itself is a contributing factor which increases the likelihood that such patients will also develop BPD, but a curious observation I’ve made which may or may not validate any correlation at all is that those I know who have schizophrenia show symptoms of BPD many years prior to subsequent symptoms of schizophrenia. Perhaps they actually are experiencing the disease for potentially long periods of time prior to becoming symptomatic? I haven’t seen any newer studies on this subject in a very long time, so it may be that someone or many are looking into these research questions as I type this. I would hope so, since I am no expert, but noted these observable correlations quickly, many years ago in the behaviors of people I knew with the disorders.
I hope this answered your initial question adequately.",schizophrenia
1419,"Absolutely. BPD is hardly ever diagnosed alone but I would get a professional opinion before assuming you have both BPD and/or schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. Bpd is not really a “disorder” it is a reaction (defense mechanism) we develop usually from two factors that cause PTSD. Biologocal, and environmental factors that could have been traumatic so your body and brain (yes they’re that powerful) have an “autopilot” mode where if they feel in danger (PTSD) act out with characteristics of BPD. but to answer your question yes it is possible to have dual diagnosis or even multiple. I have BPD and I do DBT and find it both very effective and challenging but I can already see a change in my actions.",schizophrenia
1420,"Of course it is possible to have BPD and schizophrenia, just as it is possible to be struck by lightning in the same place on two successive days - it’s just highly unlikely.
The disorders are fundamentally different and have different etiologies (causes and course of development). Schizophrenia is highly genetic and typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood and is more common in males. BPD typically is associated with some experience of trauma and is characterized by extreme emotional reactivity and hypersensitivity and is more common in females. Both are typically lifelong but both may stabilize in time with effective treatment; in the case of schizophrenia with appropriate medications and supportive counseling (to stabilize adjustment), and in the case of schizophrenia to mitigate emotional reactivity and learning of self-calming interventions.
Interestingly, psychosis may also be associated with extreme emotional reactivity (due to delusional beliefs) but in those cases we typically diagnosed Schizo-Affective Disorder as we testified in civil commitment hearings. The emotional reactivity is typically secondary to the schizophrenia rather than related to relationship issues, and lessens or disappears as the schizophrenia is addressed.",schizophrenia
1421,"Yes. I have BPD and have experienced psychosis a few times as a co morbid condition. I’m not a dr, but I’m sure that in some way, there is a link between mental illnesses. Not that they are the same as each other. Definitely not. But so many overlap each other, or carry a secondary illness or co morbid illness, that anything’s possible I reckon. But as to your question? Absolutely yes.",schizophrenia
1422,"I am not aware of any “rule” that says that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder
Perhaps the person you learned this information from incorrectly believes that borderline personality disorder means that the individual is “bordering” between neurosis and psychosis.
Under this theory, a person could not be schizophrenic because they have not crossed the psychosis threshold (i.e. their bordering between neurosis and psychosis), a required feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis.
The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. From my understanding, it is possible for an individual to have both disorders simultaneously. It may be relatively rare but it’s still possible.
A person with schizophrenia can display symptoms, in addition to psychosis, as well as some of the other symptoms of schizophrenia. The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.",schizophrenia
1423,"Borderline personality disorder is a set of learned attitudes and behaviors that are considered maladaptive, meaning that a person’s strategies for dealing with life events and emotions are, unfortunately, highly unhelpful and disruptive. It’s related to a person’s values, attitudes, habits, decisions and beliefs. It is thought to be developed, in part, by childhood abuse and the lack of helpful models for coping with abuse. It is treated mostly with a long, slow re-education through therapy.
Schizophrenia is a much deeper disorder in the way the brain works, leading to a faulty perception of reality. It is thought to be strongly influenced by genetics, pre-natal stressors (things that happened before birth), drug use and chance. It is treated mostly with medication.
It’s possible for a person to have two disorders at the same time, or start with one and develop another additional disorder. And it may be that a psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia can be destabilizing enough to make something like BPD a bit more likely. However, there is not a very strong relationship—they are not seen together very often.
It’s also possible for a disorder to be misdiagnosed by an inexperienced clinician. In that case, a diagnosis may later be updated, or replaced.
But you wouldn’t say that one became the other. Schizophrenia and BPD are very different things and BPD cannot develop into schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1424,"That is an interesting question. Certainly one can have schizophrenia without BPD. Conversely, one can have BPD without suffering schizophrenia. However, there is some fuzziness between the two diagnoses. For example,. the term Borderline Personality Disorder evolved out of the impression that people with BPD have signs and symptoms just between those seen in psychosis and those seen in neurosis. A humorous but still valuable way to distinguish psychosis and neurosis is: Psychotics believe that two plus two equals five. Neurotics know that two plus two equals four, but it really, really bothers them. Thus at times, people with BPD can exhibit signs and symptoms sometimes seen in schizophrenia. For example, people with BPD are known to sometimes experience what are sometimes referred to as “micropsychotic breaks.” These episodes can resemble symptoms of schizophrenia, but they tend to resolve fairly quickly. Another thing to consider is that personality disorders can be seen at ages much younger than the ages when schizophrenia tends to emerge. Thus, in children and adolescents, BPD may be an early sign of later development of schizophrenia. In any case, there is no compelling reason why BPD and schizophrenia can’t be comorbid. My impression however, is that worrying about BPD in a person with schizophrenia is like worrying about a cold in a person in the ICU with pneumonia.",schizophrenia
1425,"Probably, I’m sure anyone can have any mental illness along with another unless they are completely contradictory
I'm Not a doctor though !
but schizophrenia and bpd can have a lot of similarities which can make it hard to define wether you have either or
but I’m sure both is possible no ?
from my speculation and what I know of the causes/possible causes (one of the causes) of both illnesses is that it can come from childhood trauma and stress (trauma or not)
and from that analyzation from my perspective, both can maybe manifest from that. Bpd is more of mood related, as schizophrenia is having problems telling what is real or not (reality) and have many symptoms and is very complex ie every experience for each patient is different which could confuse if it’s bpd or schizophrenia
and both could definitely coexist I think.
if you wonder if you have both I suggest seeing a psychiatrist or asking a professional !",schizophrenia
1426,"A side issue:
Sometimes, under stress, brief episodes resembling schizophrenia can actually be a direct manifestation of Borderline Personality Disorder itself.",schizophrenia
1427,"Yes I do,
It does happens to quite a few of us.
Some either don't know or realize it an think it's just BPD playing off…or aren't diagnosed.
Some don't have it at all.
Some arent opened about it or ready to speak or it because of the stigmas held against both personality disorders.",schizophrenia
1428,"Yes I have this. One is mental the other is a personality disorder. Just as how you can be psychopathic and schizophrenic. I have that also. Borderlinge psychopathy is what my bpd borders on. They are urelated to each other, though they may both come from the same sources. I.E. trauma, abuse, stress etc.",schizophrenia
1429,"No. First if someone is diagnosed with schizophrenia per the DSM they can not hold another diagnosis.
People with borderline personality disorder have highly dysregulated emotional states, turbulent relationships and have enough where with all to attempt to manipulate the people close to them in order to gain more love and attention.
This is the exact opposite profile of a person with schizophrenia. People who have schizophrenia maintain regulated states of being , preferring low stimuli. They spend time with a few close friends, family or alone , don't seek attention and don't have the desire to manipulate in any way.
I hope this is helpful.",schizophrenia
1430,"Going off of what I know - no. Borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia are two independent psychological disorders. Could an individual have both? Sure. But to insinuate that one could be caused by the other, or that one could develop into the other is essentially a fallacy. For example, comorbidity in BPD most often exists with PTSD. This means that individuals with BPD will likely also have a diagnosis of PTSD. This does not mean that their borderline diagnosis caused, or even influenced, their PTSD. However, traumatic events that cause PTSD often influence the symptoms of BPD to occur.
If a person with BPD is experiencing symptoms that they consider to be likened unto schizophrenia, I would suggest you speak to a mental health professional immediately. Perhaps consider for yourself any determinants that may be causing these symptoms - maybe increased stress, med change, poor sleep, mania, etc. I think the chance of randomly developing schizophrenia after a BPD diagnosis is unlikely, but concerns are always worth bringing up to a professional - as I am not one.
I would also consider though, depending on the schizophrenic symptoms you may be experiencing, to compare them with that of PTSD. Of course, they are two different disorders, as well. However, when my own PTSD was at its peak, I would have extremely intense paranoia, visions or memories playing back in my mind, etc. Additionally, I was once on a med that made me hallucinate demon like apparitions! I was convinced I was schizophrenic at that time, but thankfully brought it up to my doctor and the med change immediately helped. Never underestimate the power of random physical/environmental factors causing terrible symptoms.
Best of luck in figuring this out.",schizophrenia
1431,"Short Answer: No, you cannot have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Schizotypal Personality Disorder (STPD) and Schizoid Personality Disorder (SPD) at the same time. They are entirely separate disorders with very different characteristics.
Schizotypal Disorder is a more severe type of disorder than either BPD or SPD. It can be thought of as existing in the gray area between the personality disorders and the psychotic disorders. It usually involves distinctly odd or eccentric behaviors, paranoid and superstitious beliefs, and may include transient psychoses.
I am not going to include Schizotypal Disorder in my comparison of BPD and SPD because:
Schizotypal belongs in a different category of disorders than BPD and SPD.
I do not consider myself an expert on Schizotypal Personality Disorder.
I have only seen a couple of people with that diagnosis in therapy during my over 40 years of practice.
Let’s compare BPD and SPD:
The following comparisons are broad generalities based on looking at groups of individuals with these diagnoses. This means that this will not necessarily apply to each and every person with BPD or SPD.
Common Symptoms
BPD—Severe abandonment fears, difficulty meeting adult responsibilities, starts many projects that they do not finish, feels like a child in an adult body, difficulty being alone, feelings of rage, panic, emptiness, helplessness, and hopelessness. Inability to function when stressed or feeling abandoned.
SPD—Mistrust of other people. Fear of intimacy, difficulty connecting with other people, social anxiety, dissociates from their body and their life when stressed, retreats into a rich fantasy life, feelings of unreality, loss of meaning in life, and existential dread. Usually can continue to function and meet everyday responsibilities even when has to dissociate to do so.
Main Solution to Life Problems
BPD—Look for someone to love who is nurturing and will love you back.
SPD—Become independent and maintain a safe distance from other people.
Reaction When Stressed
BPD—Reach out to other people for help.
SPD—Avoid other people.
Primary Relationship Need
BPD—Unconditional Love.
SPD—Interpersonal Safety.
Main Interpersonal Fears
BPD—Abandonment or Engulfment by the other person’s emotional needs.
SPD—Losing one’s independence, being intruded upon, being treated as an object to be used.
Main Defenses
BPD—Clinging to destructive personal relationships to avoid old, underlying abandonment issues and negative emotions. Destructive coping strategies, such as: substance abuse, cutting and other self-harming behaviors, over spending, gambling, reckless sexual activity, picking fights, and constantly seeking reassurance that they are loved and lovable. Finding people who will take care of them.
SPD—Keeping their physical and emotional distance from other people, retreating into fantasy, dissociating, finding ways to have enough contact with other people, so that they do not feel completely isolated, and becoming self-sufficient and financially independent so that they never have to depend on other people to take care of them.
Treatment
BPD—Involves helping clients to learn to structure their lives, identify and work towards meaningful goals, teaching them methods of tolerating negative emotions and how to self-sooth, curbing impulsive destructive acting out, work on self-care issues, work on abandonment issues and childhood traumas.
SPD—Teach negotiating skills, work on lack of basic trust, explore tendency to use distancing and isolating to solve interpersonal problems, work on teaching how to verbalize their interpersonal discomfort instead of dissociating or distancing, work on discriminating safe from unsafe people. Work on trauma and other issues related to their childhood abuse and neglect.
Punchline: The reason we call two personality disorders by different names is that they are significantly different from each other. People with BPD and SPD have different issues, coping strategies, and need very different types of therapy. In the diagnostic system that I use, a client could not be diagnosed with both of these disorders.

Addictions and isms of all kinds paired with many different Cluster Bs. I see “Narcopath” a lot, asserting a NPD and PPD comorbidity. However, it's really just PPD as it encompasses NPD and adds a few features.",schizophrenia
1433,"Yes, many mental health disorders are connected. For example, depressive episodes are very common for individuals diagnosed with BPD, therefore they can have depression as well, also anxiety and depression are quite closely connected; therefore one can have those as well. Anxiety disorders, depression and personality disorders can also lead to eating disorders and self harm, also emotional dysregulation can be connected to bipolar disorder as well. It is possible for an individual to be diagnosed with more than one mental health disorder, it is in fact a lot more common than most people think.",schizophrenia
1434,"This is from a different answer but yes I believe so. I am in the process of overcoming my aspd/bpd but it has kind of morphed into a schizophrenic like mindset.
It’s pretty shitty, it’s like you’re living a life of complete shit. Everything you want to do is never an option cause in your mind you believe it’s not good for any situation. You believe that there’s only good and bad things never a grey area of ideas that can bounce between good and bad. Either I really love someone could be anyone or hate them with a passion cause of stupidity or some shit and it takes a lot for me to get convinced other wise. I’ve since been getting better, like a lot better but still lots of problems. I digress, everything I do feels inherently wrong and I know what to think is right but even when I try to do good I see the bad too and get tangled up in good and bad never in the aspect of just doing stuff. In my fight to get over this “disorder” it resulted in a schizophrenic like being. I became very aware of me and my behaviours but when I started to question the bad in situations I began to disassociate and look deep into the of basic shit to find out if what I was doing is good. By all means I’m not saying my approach to solving it has worked, it made pretty smart but kind of odd. Our internal thoughts are always against us in some shape.",schizophrenia
1435,"Almost anything is possible, nevertheless, borderline personality disorder won’t be the cause if an individual develops schizophrenia. The two are not interconnected and have nothing to do with one another.
Depression, anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder are the most common outcomes that occur as a result of borderline personality disorder. If an individual is diagnosed with schizophrenia but has borderline personality disorder, the most common cause is because the clinician has made a misdiagnosis, a common occurrence with the illness.
Symptoms may be confusing and lead to the clinician deferring diagnosis but mistakes do happen with borderline personality disorder and the diagnosis later changed from schizophrenia to BPD.",schizophrenia
1436,"Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder are brain based illnesses where as Borderline Personality Disorder is just that a personality disorder .
It used to be that when BPD wasn't as clearly understood as is now that people would have a hard time distinguishing the two if early on in the illness. They can look similar however as a bipolar illness gets worse and a person with borderline personality matures , it is much easier to tell them apart.
Simply put, based on Marsha Linehans work and the DBT evidenced based model of treatment for BPD , people who suffer from BPD have been brought up in invalidating environments. The coping skills that were learned for survival and safety were kept for various reasons. As people get older these coping skills fail to work and when used are very maladaptive in a mature worlds. The mood swings that are witnessed in someone with BPD are a result of this.",schizophrenia
1437,"Yes it is possible. Usually in BPD, micro-psychotic episodes are well documented. But it is not only theoretically possible but seen in many cases as existing comorbidly with a more florid psychotic condition like Schizophrenia.",schizophrenia
1438,"You can get schizophrenia.
Ok…. let me get into my dark lab and tell you how we do it around here…
First of all, schizophrenia has probably more to do with the neocortex part of the brain and less with the limbic system or the reptilian complex. Chances are people who had schizophrenia had a more advanced brain to start with.
So to get schizophrenia you need to have:
A more intelligent brain in some respects
A genetic predisposition to that illness
A certain type of mental adjustment which triggers the illness
Now let’s define some important concepts:
Homeostasis
“Homeostasis” is a characteristic unique to living beings. In simple words, it means that a person adjusts to their environment. And by adjusting, we mean a change in the way it functions. And it is a reasonable assumption to make that the purpose of that function is to ensure survival.
The age when schizophrenia develops
Symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions usually start between ages 16 and 30. What a coincidence. Those are key stages of the development of personality.
The symptoms of schizophrenia & the interesting link to personality
A common symptom of schizophrenia, not officially described as such, is confusing persons - such as watching a person talk on TV and thinking they talk to you personally. Or hearing voices in your head - again as if a person is there.
Another symptom is disorganized speech and disorganized thinking. That is basically, talking or thinking inconsistently, and without connecting meanings appropriately, and without arriving at any terminating conclusion. What could be missing? I smell personalization again.
Patients with schizophrenia also show impaired emotional and social behavior, such as lack of theory of mind and misinterpretation of social situations. Impaired emotional behaviour - let’s skip that for the moment - it has been overly medically discussed already. But theory of mind and social behaviour do seem to relate to personality again. Socializing is all about personality.
Long story short, I have already made up my mind - I think the root of development of schizophrenia is a problem of personality. I was just writing the previous to get there.
So how to reproduce schizophrenia?
Given that you fulfill conditions 1 & 2, all that is needed is to create condition 3. And how do you create condition 3?
As it seems, the trigger is a change in personality, which would be caused due to homeostasis. Simply put, you would have to force someone to develop a personality that is damaging to themselves.
What kind of personality do we need? A very misaligned one: One that is not self-serving, not self-directed, not self-controlling.
How do you obtain it? Simple… through homeostasis - place a person in an environment with other people who themselves have a personality type that would induce this type of personality to the subject. An environment controlled by someone who forces others to be so: in other words, an environment rigidly controlled by someone with another personality disorder with almost the opposite characteristics.
So all we need to create condition 3 is:
Put the subject in an environment with a narcissist, a psychopath, a sociopath.
Let that person take all control away from the subject.
Give “homeostasis” enough time to do its work.
And voila…
We have just produced a schizophrenic!",schizophrenia
1439,"I know what caused schizophrenia in my case.I spent about a year doing one visit per week with a very good clinical psychologist phd.He used verbal therapy and bioenergetics therapy.Its hard to explain since you don't know my parents.They are both gone.The simple way to describe it in my case, it doesn't happen over night with one or two negative experiences in the home. My mother was a very fearfull, dark and pessimistic woman.The homelife from the time before I entered grade school was not a place of joy but more of a frightening place for a very young mind, say age 5 or 6. My mother was very self centered,did not show physical affection to me,and she definitely was not a person I could go to for any sort of uplifting sense of security when I was growing up,again beginning about age 5. So I grew up, my developing personality reacting to an unpleasant home reality I could not escape from, and I slipped into delusions, I guess as an escape mechanism only I didn't think they were delusions. I am completely recovered,no more delusions. I was very fortunate to find a good clinical psychologist who understood the dynamic that caused my disorganized, confused,delusional behavior. I most surely would have ended up in a mental institution, diagnosed as incurable by doctors who obviously didn't have the right education to deal with it.",schizophrenia
1440,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
1441,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
1442,"How to induce schizophrenia in a predisposed brain:
Be predisposed - have mental illness or addiction in your family? Have a few neurotic people that are hard to get along with? Strange relatives? Great.
Trigger your epigenetics.
Chemically: Smoke methamphetamine for 3 days straight, do 3 blotters of LSD alone at night, take 10 grams of psilocybin, stay up for 4 days without sleep, take a copious dose of MDMA or an SSRI
Environmentally: Constantly watch tragedies on the news, listen closely to the radio - it’s telling you something special, live in a busy city, listen to the noise in the background - something is there, enter dangerous situations to activate your HPA and get some adrenaline in that brain of yours, read into conspiracy theories, watch out for your phone, STAY AWAKE
Socially: Join a cult, never talk to anyone ever again - they want to hurt you, don’t tell your secrets to your family - they won’t believe you
Behaviourally: Write excessively at night, sit in silence to stir up your mind to over-interpret latent information, engage in risky behaviour, stay away from people - they know.

1444,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
1445,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.
Source: Schizophrenic, currently off my meds (I should be on meds, I will decide based on my symptoms) and working a nice high paying job. I intend to write a book about my experiences and monetize it. I have what is called “awareness” I know that I am sick. Many schizos are not as lucky as I am. The “paranoid” type of schizo, seems to leave mental reasoning and faculties intact. I still have my radio detection device, my brass helmet (to guard against radio waves etc.) and other countermeasures. At the time it all made perfect sense. How am I dealing with it? Well I have a schizo friend who says there is no upside to it, everything is terrible. I disagree. If and when I choose to make my illness public, I will have the ultimate excuse. And I have an excuse to be lazy, to not shower, to not cut my nails. It’s fucking great. I am taking ownership of my schizo, and will probably publish a book about it. By the way, delusions of grandeur is another symptom of schizophrenia.
Take care and good luck… one of the main ways people “recover” from schizophrenia is to help others. Problem is not everyone is the helping type, and not everyone needs help. I will see who I can help in this life, but first I have to look after myself. And make the most out of the time I have, because life expectancy of a schizo is 15 years less.",schizophrenia

My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!

My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
1447,"The real answer is that no-one knows for certain.
Oftentimes people will say there is a genetic component, and/or a bad childhood.
I don’t particularly agree with that.
What is known is that roughly 1% of all children born in the general population become a schizophrenic. This is despite having no family history of the illness. However, if one parent is schizophrenic then the percentage rises, but only to approximately 10%, and if both parents are schizophrenic then the odds of the child also being schizophrenic increases too, to approximately 40% chance of the illness. So, pretty tiny odds if you think about it. (I have seen other surveys that put the percentages even lower than these).
Poor nutrition in the mother when she is pregnant, or the child when young, could be a factor. Or exposure to viruses when pregnant, or as a youngster. Obviously the developing brain of a foetus, or young child is vulnerable. My family had no history of the illness. We had a good childhood. We ate good, healthy food, and my mother had good nutrition when pregnant. However, my sister was an absolutely fussy eater. She would not eat fruit or vegetables, meat, eggs, or anything healthy. She only wanted potatoes. She was taken to the doctor about the issue. Sixty odd years ago multi-vitamins were only just being rolled out, so probably were not available to her. She remained fussy until she got older, but maybe poor nutrition is what damaged her developing brain? Or, maybe, her fussy eating was an early symptom of her schizophrenia? (People often confuse causation with correlation).
Bad childhoods can definately affect the psychology of a child, but a bad childhood may also mean the child had poor nutrition, as they may have gone hungry or only ate junk food.
My sister had no genetic component, no bad childhood (I swear some medical professions think this must be a factor because of the delusions of abuse that lots of schizophrenics have *). No drug or alcohol issues. No stressful life events. Only poor nutrition could be a factor - or not.
I believe she was born with a defective brain. With a chemical imbalance or misfiring brain.
Cancer is caused by gene mutations causing cells to be cancer cells. So, this could happen to a foetus meaning a baby is born with cancer. It is rare, apparently 1–2% of babies can be found to have cancer in the first 3 months of life. So, 1% of babies can become schizophrenics. What is to say that gene mutations did not have something to do with this too, causing a developmental issue with the brain? Gene mutations can happen to anyone, at any time.
Much more research needs to be done before anyone can say for certain what causes this illneas.
Regarding delusions - they are often easy to disprove, but are very real to the schizophrenic. Also that ‘memory’ of abuse differs between episodes of psychosis. So, one time they remember X abuse, but in their next psychotic episode they say that never happened and that Y abuse happened, and in the next episode of psychosis they deny ever having said they were abused. They are called delusions for a reason. Definition: A false belief or judgment about external reality, held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary.",schizophrenia
1448,"My son is 15 and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia this past year. However, when I looked back and questioned him, I can see signs of the impending diagnosis as early as age 12. He would appear fearful for no apparent reason and was often moody. He admits now that he was hearing his name called all the time. Once a model student, he stopped doing homework and his sleep patterns altered. He experienced an anxiety attack in school in 8th grade and described dissociation and ""feeling outside of himself."" When I took him to be evaluated, the doctor asked him what was going on and he said, ""I just really don't want to be schizophrenic."" It turned out, as my son was plagued by hallucinations (auditory, sensory....he felt like it was raining on him....and visual) he was doing his own research and was afraid to have his self-diagnosis confirmed. During this period, he lost 50 pounds over 5 months. Once obsessed with fashionable clothing, he resorted to washing and wearing the same outfit and showering maybe once a week. To say that it is difficult to watch this happen to my son does not approach describing how I feel as his mother. We tried Seroquel...with not much success. He is having better results with Zyprexa. And we are learning to focus on all of the amazing traits he does have. He's extremely intelligent, has amazing recall, and my favorite part...he is one of the funniest people I know. One of my favorite things he's said, during this devastating time, is that he wants to start a group for young people with schizophrenia called ""Do You See what I See?"" I think we have two choices....to wallow and ask why him?...or to accept the negatives and celebrate the positives.",schizophrenia
1449,"A close online friend of mine suffers from schizophrenia. And believe me when I tell you, this man and his condition are very real. Just a year ago he was “talking to angels” and had “otherworldy deities” giving him quests, divine tasks and missions to go on. The Goddess Freyja spoke to him and assigned him with a list of things he had to do. Once, in Romania, he heard an ethereal voice telling him a nearby lake was a portal to another world — he stripped naked, right there and then, and jumped into the ice cold water. It was the middle of winter.
This man is 35 years old and not in touch with his parents — he hates them and blames them on his predicament. In fact he is short because, in his mind, the medication they put him on stunted his growth. His short height causes him to be overlooked by society, women in particular. He’s schizophrenic with a dash of incel-ism, too. An unfortunate connection. Not too long ago he got it into his mind that the United States government had screwed up his life. Why this is, he did not specify. He declared he, therefore, has no loyalty towards Washington and “must join the Russian army in Moscow”… In his world fairies are real. Reptillian creatures hide underneath the skin of government leaders. Everyone is in cahoots with everyone. Enemies lurk everywhere.
For the last two years, each time I speak to this man he has been a little lesser than the week before. When he’s on his meds, he’s stable, thinks of himself “cured”. Then the moment he thinks this, he goes off them. And ruins again every relationship and friendship he has. I’m the last man standing among his friends. Every time we speak I wonder — will there be another?",schizophrenia
1450,"Original question:What are some signs that a person is schizophrenic when you speak to them?
I share my personal experince.
We were in final year of med school when my friend developed schizophrenia. He had classic Schnwider's first rank symptom of auditory hallucinations.
We would go for a walk and sit on a bench. Then he would tell me that the two people walking 100m away are talking about him. I would sit in his room on 2nd floor and he would tell me that the guys walking on the road say nasty things about him. He said he knew he cant hear them from so far away but they talk about him.
I would be speaking and his eyes would suddenly go blank- and then refocus after a while. Once I stopped midsentence to check whether he is indeed mentally with me during such occurence. I asked him about it when he came to, and he confided that he feels(hears?) that I talk ill about him.
He forgot his address, his phone number. He would fall asleep smoking and set his mattress on fire. He patched his rubber slipper with tape or something when it broke. Then he lost a slipper and would walk around with one slipper only.
I had finished psychiatry last semester so I took him to a psychiatrist. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was much better a year later with medication.
A very dear friend. A gem of a person. Wish the best for him, wherever he may be now.",schizophrenia
1451,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia

1453,"There’s a fascinating experiment I learned about in one of my cognitive science classes in uni. It went like this:
Start with a big wheel that has a whole bunch of buttons around the edge, and a button in the center. The buttons around the edge are all numbered, but not necessarily in any particular order; the numbers might look random, like 22, 6, 108, 49, 3…whatever.
Anyway, in addition to the buttons, there are also two lights, a red light and a green light.
This does have to do with your question, I promise. I’m getting to that.
The experimenter brings a test volunteer into the room with the wheel and says “this is a test of learning and mathematical reasoning.” That’s a lie, of course.[1] It’s actually an experiment about how people form internal models of the real world.
The experimenter says “There is a pattern to the numbers on the wheel. Your job is to figure out the pattern. Press any two buttons with numbers on them, then press the button in the middle. If those two numbers are related, the green light will come on, if they’re not, the red light will come on. We want to see if you can figure out the pattern.”
Now here’s the sneaky part:
The numbered buttons? They’re fake. They don’t do anything. There is no pattern. When you push the button in the middle, the red light and green light come on randomly.
It’s set up so that you do the experiment in four trials.
The first trial: The green light comes on 20% of the time, chosen at random.
The second trial: The green light comes on 50% of the time, chosen at random.
The third trial: Disaster! The green light never comes on. No matter what numbers you push you always get red.
The fourth trial: Triumph! The green light always comes on, no matter what buttons you push.
Now here’s the interesting thing:
After the experiment is over, you explain that there is no pattern. The buttons with the numbers are fake. They don’t do anything. They aren’t even hooked up.
And the weird part is, almost every test volunteer you do this to will refuse to believe you. They’ll call you a liar. They’ll say you’re lying because they outsmarted you and figured out the pattern, so you’re lying to them because you’re angry that they ruined your experiment.[2] They’ll get angry at you. They’ll run out of the room. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you take the wheel apart and show them that the numbered buttons are fake. They’ll refuse to believe you even if you push the middle button over and over and show them the pattern of lights.
Once our brains have learned something through trial and error, we will hang onto that pattern we’ve deduced even in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence that we are wrong.

Okay, so what does this have to do with your question?
Most people who go through this experiment refuse to accept the truth. They become so fixated on their own cleverness, so obsessed with their own skill, so proud of having figured out the pattern, that they cannot accept they were fooled.
They will actually believe the experimenter is lying to them before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out. They will actually reject the evidence of their own eyes, seeing fake buttons that aren’t attached to anything, before they accept that there was no pattern to figure out.
There is one group of people, however, who do not do this:
Paranoid schizophrenics.
Paranoid schizophrenics, as a group, almost always figure out there is no pattern and the numbers don’t mean anything before the experimenter explains it to them. They go through the trials, and at the end, when the green light always comes on, they say “this is bullshit, you’re fucking with me, the numbers don’t mean diddly, those buttons don’t do anything.”
Paranoia is the hypertuned hypothesis that everyone you encounter has an agenda against you and is trying to deceive you.
So. Why can people with paranoid schizophrenia pick out psychopaths so easily?
I’m not actually convinced that they can. It might simply be that a stopped watch is right twice a day. If you believe that everyone is a psychopath, you’ll have a 100% success rate identifying psychopaths…and a 100% false positive rate on non-psychopaths.
However, having said that…
There is one difference. Most people who believe they have figured out a pattern will keep trying the pattern over and over, and each green light becomes more “proof” that they are right.
A person who believes everyone is trying to trick or deceive them doesn’t do this.
A normal person who thinks that the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 22, then when the green light comes on, say “Aha! I was right!”
A paranoid schizophrenic who thinks the numbers 101 and 22 go together will push 101 and 87, looking for a red light…because they want to see if you’re pulling a fast one on them, so if the green light comes on, they’ll know that the experiment is a lie.
So they press 101 and 87, sure enough the green light comes on, and aha! They’ve got you. They’ve figured out you’re deceiving them.
In other words, they aren’t testing the hypothesis “there is a pattern to the numbers and I’ve figured it out.” They’re testing the hypothesis “this whole experiment is a s...

1454,"My biggest sign was people was following me to harm me, secondary was they was talking about me and laughing at me.
I went through a divorce.
I did odd things like walking down the road with out shirt and shoes. I skipped from spot to spot on the road.
I was hyper and talk alot aimlessly to my father and nonsensical indirectly to my neighbour. I wanted to lose weight and was exercising a lot.
i had difficulty sleeping.
When i walked up the step to work, I felt a huge pain in my groin area making walking difficult.
My work was affected i rowed in a loud voice with no one in particular. My work relationship was affected. I was reported to Human Resource. I resigned been unable to function normally.
The reason i resigned too was i was afraid i will not feel better.
I row with my mother alot (care giver) without reason.
My mother took me forceable to the hospital where i was admitted for two weeks and sedated.
On release from hospital i was given medication which i still use dutifully.
I am trying to cope with the side effects of the medication, one of which is over sleep roughly two days every week. The doctor said that was a good thing (sleep) I did not argue.
During the course of recovery i had to deal with the public perception and still do.
Now that i am feeling a lot better, it helps me to chronicle the past with a view to understanding my condition in a revelant forum. I am always interested in reading and researching the sickness. I reach a lot of similar people at my clinic and identify with them.
I can now articulate myself, that was difficult plus the interest to articulate was not there on the onset of my sickness.
In my case i suspected something was wrong to me before hand, on admission my care giver related to the doctor on my condition, I was clueless. During the course of attending clinic i related my feelings.
That was around age 40 i am now 52.
My psychiatrist never declared me oficially as having schizophrenia, my research is on going.
I do yoga regularly for the past six years and i am interested in anyone experience with recovery from schizophrenia (psychiartic disorder) using yoga",schizophrenia
1455,"As a rule of thumb: on a population level it’s about 1 in 100. Any blood siblings or parents with schizophrenia it’d go up to 1 in 10. For twins it’s 1 in 2. So it certainty suggests that schizophrenia both have genetic and environmental components, some are more at-risk for developing the syndrome than others. That said, majority of schizophrenics have no family history. Factors like stress, trauma, drug abuse (especially marijuana), etc. can top-over your strain capacity and even trigger a psychotic episode. No one event necessarily cause schizophrenia, it’s often a confluence of many factors cumulating one on top of another.
Note: schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder, meaning they’re marked by relapsing episodes of psychosis not directly associated with a mood state (e.g. bipolar with psychotic features). And it’s a long term condition, with the diagnosis criteria rather arbitrarily requiring signs of disturbance lasting continuously for >6 months and major positive component for >1 month, where other conditions are ruled out that can better explain the symptoms (e.g. brain tumour, drug-induced psychosis).
Anyone even mildly familiar with schizophrenia are aware of the demarcation between positive and negative symptoms — “add-on trait” v.s. “removed trait”. There’s also cognitive symptoms, as it says in the name, that are thinking-learning deficit aspects associated with schizophrenia, such as poor memory, poor attention, disorganised thinking and speech. It could be said that psychosis is characterised by loss of stability in cognitive structures where one cannot implicitly take things for what they’re anymore; “there must be something more” or “… something amiss”, a setting stone for delusional moods that can catalyse development of suspicions into overt delusions. To patients the delusions can often be a release, even if it frightens and hurts them in the process, as they’ve alleviated the immense cognitive dissonance for not resolving the apparent senselessness or uncanny coincidences. This brings me to the model of aberrant salience…
There’s also a class called ‘basic symptoms’. To my shame, I haven’t seen many articles describe them or go into depth. Some googling’ll pop-up mostly scholar papers. It’s basically a set of subjective symptoms recognised by patients along varying levels of awareness as a disturbance or divergence from normal processes in perception and cognition. Usually the patients find it difficult to put into words his/her experiences but a guided structured interview can often bring them out into the light of cognisance.
They surface and remain present in all three stages of psychosis associated with schizophrenia (prodrome, acute, remission), although insight into them is usually only present during the prodromal and remission phases. Presence of these symptoms is markedly predictive in determining whether one is at an at-risk state for emergence into more frank episodes. When assessed to be in this group (say, two or more in this list occurring at least once per week for over three months but less than a year) then you’ve statistically about 50% chance of developing full-on psychosis within the next two years, 90% chance within the next decade.
Cognitive and Perceptual Basic Symptoms Associated With Psychosis and Prototypic Self-observations by Patients:
Thought interference, i.e., an intrusion of completely insignificant thoughts hindering concentration/thinking.
Thought perseveration, i.e., an obsessive like repetition of insignificant thoughts or mental images.
Thought pressure, i.e., a self-reported “chaos” of unrelated thoughts.
Thought blockages either with or without intrusion of a new thought also includes a sudden loss of the thread or train of thoughts.
Disturbance of receptive language, i.e., paralysis in the immediate comprehension of simple words/sentences, either read or heard, that can result in giving up reading or avoiding conversations.
Disturbance of expressive speech, i.e., problems in producing appropriate words, sometimes also experienced as a reduction in active vocabulary.
Disturbances of abstract thinking, i.e., an unusual basic symptom seen when asking the patient to explain sayings or idioms.
Inability to divide attention between simultaneous nondemanding tasks that each draw primarily upon a different sense that would not usually require a switching of attention.
Captivation of attention by details of the visual field that catches and holds the look.
Decreased ability to discriminate between perception and ideas, true memories and fantasies.
Unstable ideas of reference with insight.
Derealisation, i.e., a decreased emotional and gestalt connection with the environment.
Visual or acoustic perceptual disturbances with insight. Unlike hallucinations or schizotypal perceptual distortions, basic symptom perceptual observations are not regarded as real but are immediately recognized as a sensory or subjective problem. The knowledge that the misperception, e.g., a wrong colouring, distorted shape or changed sound quality/intensity, has no counterpart in the real world is immediate and unquestioned.
Of course, for anyone self-assessing, it requires an honest and frank observations into their subjective experiences alongside fully understanding the meaning of each item. This is where meeting and discussing with a knowledgeable doc might come in, if you haven’t already.",schizophrenia
1456,"It occurs in many ways due to astral simulation. When a soul is in the physical form as every living being is, they don’t interact with the astral world unless they want to ( ie astral projection). The physical world is all they interact with. With schizophrenia, they have a “gift” and a “curse” at the same time. They can interact with the astral world a lot more and the astral world is full of many spirits. They may see souls of dead relatives, different sceneries, and in many cases malevolent spirits. The voices they hear and things they see are these astral individuals observing them and commenting random stuff. This causes paranoia as the spirits can say scary things which the affected will assume will occur in the physical. Its full blown overstimulation. They have the physical world and the astral to deal with at the same time. They can have a hard time differentiating between what is real (physical) and what is bluff (astral). The “veil” so to speak is thinner with these individuals. Now the reason for this could be taking extrasensory inducing drugs such as LSD and even marijuana and perhaps a genetic basis. Even mediums are not on the level of these people. Its not fun at all. Likewise, sleep paralysis is caused by astral occurrences (soul awake, body asleep).",schizophrenia
1457,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?

1459,"Before I start writing, I wish to tell you that I speak out of my personal experience and am not a medical practitioner. I now about this disease because my brother suffers from it.
Schizophrenia is a mental condition in which a person becomes extremely paranoid of his surroundings. This includes all his loved ones. This is because the patient experiences third party hallucinations. To explain this let me give you a scenario. Imagine you are in a room alone with your friend having a quiet conversation but suddenly a third person comes in whom you don't know and keeps looking at you, ridicules whatever you say keeps criticizing you and telling you that your friend is the one making fun at you. And here comes the fun part only you can see this person.
Isn't that scary? That's what goes on in a patient's ind every second. It is so bad that after a particular stage he cannot tell what is true and what is a figment of his imagination. Its hell. He would get violent and abusive. Just imagine how you would feel if you were being observed and criticized 24*7 . And you know what the worst part is? It is not curable. It is treatable at the best.",schizophrenia
1460,"It is hard because the shunning by regular society makes starving for a relationship pretty intense. If you show interest, they can glom onto you and be with you as much as you can tolerate. Then you have to reject them like everyone else has.
And that is the clue. As much as you can tolerate.
This is healthy boundary time. Watch how much and when. Be clear about the personal space and privacy. Be careful of the dependency as you already have an inkling of it.
This will eventually require you to look at your quality of life beliefs and your philosophy of society, religion and humanity beliefs It can be a gift but it also can drown you.
It is a courageous and wonderful thing you are contemplating, Good luck.",schizophrenia
1461,"It's very difficult.
I had a friend that I met when I was 15 years old.
He was the life of the party. Everyone loved him.
Fast forward 4 years. He started to become angry alot for no good reason.
He would accuse me of stealing from him.
I had no idea what was wrong. All of our friends had no idea.
He would be by himself in the livingroom, laughing at nothing
Another two years went by. He had no where to go. I moved out of my parents house and they took him in.
He broke everything in their house, not on purpose, he was just hard on everything.
My parents had to ask him to leave because he was getting worse. He would accuse my mother of stealing his money, his clothes and his food. None of that was true.
He ended up at his father's house for another two years and his father had had enough and told him to leave.
Btw, he was now on meds and they didn't really help.
Years had gone by, he would knock on my door to visit but I would make up a story that I was late for something and had to go. He was just too difficult to deal with.
He ended up in some low income apartment building and he died last fall.
He was 50",schizophrenia
1462,"Listen to what he or she has to say. To hear that someone has delusions or hallucinations means nothing. One person might say he or she hears people jeering and talking about “that worthless person.” Another person may hear the Virgin Mary saying “Take your pills . . . Listen to your doctor.”
Don’t try to be diagnostician or therapist. There may be someone already doing that chore. You are a friend, and thus very valuable. He or she wants you as you are. Mental illness is isolating.
Allow him or her to sleep as much as possible. Mental illness is often accompanied by sleep disturbances. Catching up on sleep can help a schizophrenic even before the anti-psychotic medications are issued.
Keep on living your normal life. The cold wind off of your collar as you come into the room will come to be very pleasant. Bring issues of the school or college newspaper, reports of sad football teams, free things in the community. If he or she had an interest in something which is in the hospital — art sessions, foosball or a video game — ask if he or she wants to get up and look into it. Ask once each time you come.
Don’t be frustrated if he or she forgets things. Don’t be frustrated if he or she “doesn’t want to do anything.” Part of schizophrenia are cognitive deficits and a resistance to move. Talk about things you yourself like and plan for.
Secretly hope for your friend’s immediate treatment. If you are religious, pray for it: if not, wish for it with all of your heart. One of the few determinants of recovery is speed in treatment occurring soon if he or she is one of the group who will recover. CBT (not related to drugs), *accurate* medications, and cognitive remediation may all play a part in this.",schizophrenia
1463,"If you truly want to help him correct this issue, get him to see a clinical psychologist who does bioenergetics along with verbal therapy.Bioenergetics is NOT the same as biofeedback.Schizophrenia involves the entire person which means his physical body is involved due to stresses he was under growing up.The physical stresses within the body are inter realated to the delusional thinking which is why BIOENERGETICS is absolutely critical along with verbal therapy. Please don't waste his precious time and money with pill doctors with fancy degrees on the wall or doctors who say its never going to be correctable just have to “cope” with it.",schizophrenia
1464,"It’s difficult to help a friend with schizophrenia because it’s hard for them to trust that you understand them. The most important thing is to try to understand the behavior and mind of a person who exhibits behaviors that get them labeled or diagnosed as schizophrenic. Personally, I think that people who get this label have been gaslit for most of their lives. I think they don’t know what’s real and what’s in their imagination because the people around them have been telling them that things that are real aren’t real.
For example, when you have parents who do things they are ashamed of. Say a parent has a special friend who is not a marital partner. A kid might see the body language that indicates a special relationship, but when they ask about it, the parent says that there’s nothing special going on.
Another example is if a parent uses substances, but when the child asks about the drug or alcohol use, the parent denies they are doing it. Worse, they tell the kid they are lying and shouldn’t be saying these things. This teaches the child to mistrust their own perceptions. The authority (the parent) is telling them that they aren’t seeing what they are seeing. This is crazy-making, and I believe this kind of behavior is what leads to schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is when a person doesn’t know whether or how to trust their own perceptions. They don’t know which perceptions are real and which, as their parents told them, are their own lying eyes. This makes it difficult to distinguish between real perceptions that are lies, and imagined perceptions that most of us understand are imagined. If you don’t trust your real perceptions, and you think some of your real perceptions are imagined, then it casts doubt on your imagination, and you can easily start to think that imagination is real.
So, if you see your parent drinking, and they tell you they aren’t drinking, then they must be right. They’re the authority. You have to trust them. So you come to believe you see things that aren’t real. That also means that you are imagining things (seeing drinking which isn’t drinking), so you think your real perception is an imagined perception. So what you think is imagined (but is real) seems so real that you lose the ability to determine what is imagination and what is real.
This is the serious problem of a person who has been gaslit in this way. It becomes so difficult to tell what is real and what is imagination. Things that seem very real — well, you’ve been told by the highest authority that you are imagining them.
How can you manage a friendship with someone who has learned to mistrust their perceptions and can’t tell what is real and what is imagined? I think it takes a long time and a lot of work and is an effort that is unlikely to be successful because people who don’t trust their own perceptions will have a hard time trusting anyone.
I thought I could build a relationship like this once. The first thing I tried to do was to show I understood. I listened to her stories. I tried to not judge her. I tried not to tell her she wasn’t seeing reality. I tried to affirm that I believed her stories as things she really experienced, even if I did not think it was all real. For me, separating out real from imagination was not important. Actually, I think she had already done so much work on this that she understood what was real and what wasn’t.
For her, the temptation was that she wanted to believe what she knew was imagination was real because the reality was too painful. In her imagination, a teacher loved her, and had a psychic connection with her. Their job was to save the world by showing the rest of us what love was, and being a conduit for love to enter all of our lives. This was an extremely powerful narrative for her and she very much wanted it to be true. Hell, I wanted it to be true, too. Although I wanted to be the teacher.
I asked her to tell me the story, over and over, teasing out more and more details. I did this because I believe that if people listen to their own stories out loud, it becomes easier to start to separate out reality and imagination. It requires a lot of patience and I think it helps to listen with loving and supportive ears. I had to try to stop myself from questioning anything, or trying to state my opinion. The goal, for me, was for her to listen to herself critically, and start to decide, on her own, what made sense and what was probably wishful thinking.
If I intervened with what I thought, then I would not only be doing the work she needed to do for herself, but I would also be turning myself into an oppositional force that she could react against. In the end, I could not control myself well enough, and I did become an oppositional force. I think I grew impatient. It wasn’t over this particular story. There were other stories in our relationship that I could not hold my tongue over. But I think I learned a lot about how much patience it takes, and I was not up to the task.
It is painful that we cannot be friends any more, but I’m just not up for it. I wanted more, in return, than I was getting, and I was getting impatient, especially since it seemed like we’d had a real breakthrough. It felt like she had really come to trust me very deeply, and that seemed to shock her so much, that she reacted by cutting off the relationship.
Come to think of it, that happened again, a few months later, with another woman who was probably having great difficulty dealing with a lot of trauma. Many people in her life had committed suicide, and I think that she started getting really close to me, but worried about me staying with her, and the shock of realizing how vulnerable she was to me, made her pull away.
The problem for me is that I crave that vulnerability. I crave that openness and trust. And so when it starts happening, I encourage it. I guess I had no idea how it would affect them to start to feel so open to someone. Maybe I needed to protect them by not being so available to them, and letting them become more open more slowly, so they wouldn’t have that shocking, sudden awareness of how close they’d gotten to me, which may have caused them to pull back, catastrophically, at least for our relationships.
I have sort of digressed, but sort of not. The point is that each relationship has at least two people in it, and while I can tell you what I learned about them and what I learned about myself, you will have your own psyche and personality to deal with as well as that of the person you are involved with, and there will be things I don’t know about or haven’t experienced, and can’t warn you about.
In theory, over time, with the right support, a person who doesn’t trust their own perceptions can learn to trust their own perceptions. They can learn to be more judicious about their understanding of what is real and what is imagination. They can incorporate their imagination constructively into their lives (instead of just stopping it). Then, maybe, it will be possible to build a stable relationship.
I thought I could be that person. I’ve tried, over and over again, to build relationships with people who have similar struggles to mine. I’ve failed because I have my own problems and my own triggers, and building relationships with people who have traumas similar to mine is difficult because it is easy to get into situations where we misread each others signals, and our old patterns of behavior get triggered at unfortunate times, and we end up mutually destroying the relationship. I’ve done this more times than I can count, and while I am learning a lot about it, and I remain hopeful, that hope is leavened by despair that I can ever make it work for more than a few months. No… that we can ever make it work. It’s not all on me.
I don’t know if this will help. It seems like there’s more about what doesn’t work than anything helpful, although knowing potential pitfalls can be helpful. For me, the world of a person who struggles to separate out reality and imagination is actually very beautiful. It is challenging, but it is so creative and awesome that I am endlessly attracted to such people. But let me know if anything that I said was useful, or if you have other questions or follow up questions. There is so much pain in so many people in the world, and if my understanding can help lessen that pain, I want to do that. Not just for them, either, but for myself, because I also am always looking for people who might understand me, and the trauma I’ve experienced, and the ways that trauma affects me. So if you have an ounce of an inclination to message me — do so. I like to talk about this stuff.",schizophrenia
1465,"The worst thing for a schizophrenic is fear. This fear clouds and warps their analysis of their environment.
Their fear, usually stems from pain they have been caused in the past. So out of protection from the pain they fear so much, they try to do everything they can to see danger.
They are on constant alert for threats, they always think 10 steps ahead, and constantly analyze worst case scenarios.
But when they lose this fear of pain, that is strangling their minds, the brain can begin to function better again. They can then experience other emotions, such as joy, peace, love, hope and contentment.
They deserve these emotions. But they must love themselves in order to realize this for themselves. You can inspire them to love their uniqueness by loving it as fiercely as you can. Believe in them, listen to them, respect them.
And let them see the beauty of themselves reflected in your eyes. So that they can see it and start to believe, and let the cloak of fear fall away.",schizophrenia
1466,"You are already helping your friend by being their friend. People with schizophrenia suffer greatly from the absence of relationships. This is in part due to their tendency to withdraw, and partly due to the discomfort that others have around people with mental illness.
Depending upon the depth of the symptoms, your friend’s thinking will greatly impact their communication. Their ability to communicate, both in expression and reception, can be marred. They may appear to confuse the abstract with the concrete, and visa versa. It can take patience. In some ways it is very similar to trying to communicate with a person with autism.
In other words, it takes the willingness to communicate, getting to know them well enough to understand their quirks and nuances. And to love them, anyway.",schizophrenia
1467,"Sometimes the best thing anyone can do to help me is to just leave me alone. I appreciate the people in my life that understand this about me. Be supportive and let them know if they need you then you will be there. No two schizophrenics are alike. I like to be alone and trying to get me to socialise when I don’t want to is a recipe for disaster. On behalf of your friend I thank you. They are very lucky to have you care about them. As a schizo myself I can say good friends are hard to keep because we’re usually put in the too hard, don’t bother basket.",schizophrenia
1468,"I would say: support them as a person.
I don't know the specifics of this person's situation, but I'm guessing from what you did say that they are experiencing more negative than positive symptoms (that is, more symptoms of poor functioning than those of hallucinations, delusions, behavioural abnormality and so on). And medication isn't as helpful with the former as with the latter, but they can still be helped to function as much as possible. And it's impossible to tell how much function is possible until one tries. (Depending on where in the world you are, how much is possible to try varies.)
But why do I say the most important thing might be simply to support them as a person? Because one of the challenges people with mental disorders face is that their personhood is easily forgotten behind the illness. This is not to blame you: it's something we are all prone to, even we who are professional caregivers.
So, yes, this person has schizophrenia, and needs help with the unique challenges that brings. But I've personally found I give my best when I help the person, not only as a patient, but as a person. Give them food when they're hungry. Help them find stuff they've lost. Talk with them when I'm around and can make time. Remind them to take care of themselves, and help make that easier to do. Relate with them, as much as possible, as you would with anyone else. And take it one day at a time.
Your simple acceptance of this person as a person may do more for them than you might imagine.",schizophrenia
1469,"I’d suggest listening to them first. Have a conversation about their specific needs in a friendship. Next, depending on how often they have delusions or hallucinations, encourage them to ask you questions about their senses of beliefs, so you can help them identify moments of symptoms (whenever I would have a belief that came out of nowhere, made too much sense, and yet I’d never believed it before, I’d ask a friend “Hey, does this sentence make sense to you?” and if they say no, I know I’m delusional at that moment. Tricks like that can help sometimes (not in every case though)).
If they are on meds, they may have a variety of side effects, from sleep disturbances, eating problems, gas, nausea, increased depression or anxiety. Be patient with them. If you can tell the side effects are really hurting them, encourage them to talk to their doctor.
Be patient, and be kind.",schizophrenia
1470,"When my son was in HS he and a group of friends included a boy who was a little different or “off” and some might call it. The group often hung out at our house since we always had something on the stove for them. This boy was a sweet and kind as could be despite being raised in a rough environment. He and all the boys hugged me and called me Mom. As these boys graduated and went on their separate ways their friendships shrank but Tommy always stayed with my son and one other friend. Later we heard he was diagnosed as Schizophrenic. He took his medication regularly and was looked after by my son and his other friend. He often stopped by for dinner. Tommy worked, married, lived in a house and owned a truck and motorcycle. His wife left him. He stopped taking his meds, went psychotic, lost his truck and cycle and became homeless. He followed our family when we moved to Colorado and loosely hung on. Slowly he drifted away and shuffled between homelessness and jail. I always kept clothes for him for whenever I saw him. He is still in town and is seen every now and then by the boys. That sweet boy Tommy is lost to us now.",schizophrenia
1471,"Best is to take him to a psychiatrist. In case he doesn't have insight (realisation that something is wrong with him), then you can speak to the psychiatrist first or arrange for a home visit.
Speak to family members. Psycho education of family members about the illness is very important. Family members are the one's who will be giving him medications. Attitude of family members is important. There's a term called expressed emotions, which mean negative emotions like criticism, hostility and over involvement displayed by family members which can affect the outcome of illnesses and cause more relapses.

1472,"Mental health is as important as your physiological health. Our mind controls our body so we must ensure that we're having a sound psychological health along with our friends and colleagues.
Inorder to help people who is undergoing mental health issues we should follow the following steps.
Listen to them carefully without any intension of replying immediately or staring any debate.
Make them feel safe and secure by giving them enough support and keep their story a secret. Don't share their problems randomly with anyone because if the main person would come to know about it then it might have a bad impact on their mind. In simple words don't leak their secrets because if they chooses you for sharing their problem then they must be trusting you.
Listen to them completely. Don't just start your own relatable story in parallel as it might prevent them from speaking about their problem completely.
Be humble and friendly. Their story might bore you but try your best to be humble even if you have to say them to stop, say it in a humble manner. Don't hurt them anymore because they're already carrying so much of burden in their mind.
Never ever call them mental/weak/disable. I repeat never.
Ask them to visit a doctor and make them understand that it's completely ok to do so. If both of you are comfortable then try to accompany them while visiting mental health clinic.
Stop saying ‘everything will be fine', ' it's ok everyone goes through it', ‘keep smiling and you will forget your problem' types of things.
Keep checking on them on regular basis. You can actually save someone's life by doing it.
Try to involve them in activity like gymming, yoga, painting, dancing, photography. Physical activity can help them in getting distracted by their problems and it can also help in reducing their stress level.
Ask them to develop a diary writing habit. Actually this is mandatory for everyone, it helps in clearing both your mind and heart in minutes.

1473,"First I would have to clarify if you’re referring to a person living with schizophrenia or a person living with the disorder that is hospitalized. If you’re a friend, and they’re struggling with an episode, then be there for them as much as possible. Allow them to voice their experience…. No matter how far out it might seem. It is all too real for them. It’s so extremely bizarre and painful to feel as though you have no control over the most important thing in the human experience…. your mind. Remind them to hold on the knowing that the bad moments will pass and lift and they will have themselves back. keeping positive perception is important to the best of one’s ability. Having the ability to pick yourself up by your bootstraps and keep going…. resolve is key. Try not to discredit their experience because I can assure you…. It ABSOLUTELY feels, to the point of a knowing, that something else is imposing on your mind. Avoiding the victim mentality helps keep one in control.
If the person is hospitalized, visit them as often as possible and assure them they are loved and supported. Don’t be offended if it seems like they don’t respond with the same warm treatment…as they are likely heavily medicated and are suffering with an excruciating event, losing the very thread of themselves, and being removed from their home and society. If they’re willing to share their experience, listen and be patient. In my experience, it took a while after my early onset, to be functional once again. Love and patience. Anything that can make them feel grounded.",schizophrenia
1474,"First, ask them if they are suffering from schizophrenia. Sometimes the word is used as a way of ostracizing people, rather than a medical diagnosis. You don’t want to play those games.
If they say yes, then ask them to let you know if there’s anything you can do to help, or please mention if anything you do is unhelpful.",schizophrenia
1475,"1. Educate yourself: The first step to helping someone with psychosis is to educate yourself about the condition. Learn about the symptoms, causes, and treatment options so you can better understand what the person is going through.
2. Listen and be supportive: People with psychosis may feel scared, confused, and isolated. It is important to listen to them without judgment and offer your support. Let them know that you are there for them and that you care about their well-being.
3. Encourage them to seek professional help: Psychosis is a serious mental health condition that requires professional treatment. Encourage the person to seek help from a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. Offer to help them find a suitable healthcare provider and accompany them to appointments if needed.
4. Be patient and understanding: Recovery from psychosis takes time and can be a difficult journey. Be patient with the person and understand that they may have good and bad days. Avoid getting frustrated or angry with them, as this can make their symptoms worse.
5. Help them stick to their treatment plan: If the person is receiving treatment, encourage them to stick to their treatment plan, including taking medication as prescribed and attending therapy sessions. Offer to help them keep track of their appointments and remind them to take their medication if needed.
6. Create a safe and supportive environment: People with psychosis may feel overwhelmed and anxious in certain situations. Create a safe and supportive environment for them by minimizing stressors and avoiding triggering topics or situations.
7. Encourage healthy habits: Encourage the person to engage in healthy habits, such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly. These habits can help improve their overall well-being and may also help manage their symptoms.
8. Offer practical support: People with psychosis may have difficulty with daily tasks, such as managing their finances or keeping their living space organized. Offer practical support by helping them with these tasks or finding resources that can assist them.
9. Be aware of warning signs: Learn to recognize the warning signs of a psychotic episode, such as changes in behavior or mood. If you notice these signs, encourage the person to seek help from their healthcare provider.
10. Take care of yourself: Caring for someone with psychosis can be emotionally and physically draining. It is important to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed. Remember that you cannot help someone else if you are not taking care of yourself first.

1476,"Listen.
That’s all. That’s all the steps. It’s surprisingly hard to do because we’re trained from Day 1 to listen in order to respond.
But when someone comes to you about their mental health, your job is to listen.
Just, listen.
Let’s talk about how to listen when someone tells you about struggles with mental health.
A few things to keep in mind:
Don’t worry about formulating the perfect response. You won’t—chances are, the person opening up to you has no idea what they want you to say.
Your job, most importantly, is to allow them to open up. You’re a sponge, not a wall. Let things soak in.
If you ask them any questions about their mental health, it doesn’t hurt to remind them that you won’t be upset if they feel uncomfortable answering. That’s part of creating a safe, open environment.
This is all from my experience in the world of mental health—your mileage may vary.
Here are some awesome things to say when someone opens up to you about a mental health issue:
Wow, I’m sorry you’re going through that.
Thank you so much for opening up to me about that.
Do you need any help?
It’s a good idea to be specific, if you can— “Do you need help getting groceries/caring for your dog/doing laundry?”
Have you gone to a doctor?
If no, you might offer to help them find a doctor. I don’t recommend saying you’ll “do it for them”—that can come off as infantilizing—but rather, that you’ll “help them out with it.”
If they’ve scheduled an appointment, offer to go with them or to follow up and make sure they’ve gone (if you think that’s something they’d appreciate). Some people appreciate the extra accountability.
If yes, ask about their treatment plan or if there’s any way you can help them to be successful.
Do you need company? I’m around today at [X time]. If not, I totally understand!
Make it tangible. “Free at 7PM” is way better than “We can hang out whenever.”
Make it clear that they don’t have to feel bad about saying no. And don’t feel about if they do say no—it’s not about you, I promise.
In general, ask questions that continue the dialogue. There’s no information you need to get—so don’t listen with that intention. Listen to everything they tell you, make it clear that you’re very glad they feel comfortable sharing, and ask questions to help them open up.
You should always, always, always follow up later. Depending on the circumstances (severity of illness, symptoms, the person), you might want to follow up anywhere from a few hours to a few days later.
Some great things to say to check in:
Has [X symptom] improved?
“Are you sleeping more?” “How’s your headache?” “Is your appetite coming back at all?”
Consider the person. If a specific symptom is very sensitive for them, it might be better to keep things vague—”How are you feeling?”
Specific questions make it clear that you heard them. That makes them more willing to open up because it’s clear that you listen.
How are you coping with [Y circumstance]? Has [Z situation] improved at all?
If they told you about a specific stressor that’s contributing to their mental health troubles, ask about it.
Do you need help with X?
Have you been going to therapy/taking your medication?
Don’t shame them if they say no. Be gentle and understanding. Your job is not to fix them. You’re there to support them—not scold them.
Following up is a little different, in that you’re initializing the conversation. But don’t look at this list and think Aw, damn. I have to get through everything on this list. Use this as a starting point. They might end up wanting to talk about something and it’ll take off from there.
Let them lead. If they want to talk about X instead of Y, talk about X.
I know it can be exhausting, but keep checking in. Keep offering to spend time with them. Keep offering to help.
It’s really, really easy to do this once and go “Wow, I am such a great friend.” And you are. But people with mental illnesses need constant support.
It could be long-term. Don’t be afraid of that.
And remember:
People are individuals.
Not everyone needs and/or wants these same things.
You’re a support. Be there to listen if they need you, but don’t force it.
Find what works best for both of you.
You can’t give more than you have.
Don’t overexert yourself.
Just, listen.
That’s all it takes.",schizophrenia
1477,"Luckily, the best ways to support recovery for experiences labeled as “schizophrenia” are oftentimes not medical in nature—you do not need access to drugs and hospitals to make a difference most of the time, and some people are much better off not going through the conventional “mental healthcare” system even if they can access it.
However, what is most helpful may differ from one person and situation to the next, and generalizations can be vague or unhelpful. Here is a previous post of mine which addresses the idea of “treatment” and includes many links at the bottom to Quora posts and external websites which speak about constructively working with individuals who have been termed as “schizophrenic”: Mark Dunn's answer to How long does a schizophrenic patient has to take antipsychotic drugs for treatment?
That said, you mention he takes antipsychotics “on and off”. Antipsychotics create a physical dependence and that can result in a withdrawal syndrome for many or most patients. Generally, these sorts of drugs should be tapered slowly when increasing or reducing doses, and this can take months or even years for some patients. Rapid dose changes and only taking drugs intermittently can be just like quitting alcohol or heroin cold turkey, and can involve neuropsychiatric side effects like depression, anxiety, psychosis, anhedonia, etc.
Antipsychotics have many troubling risks and potential side effects even during normal and consistent use, including all the symptoms which are said to describe “schizophrenia” (such as ‘disorganized thoughts’ and other cognitive difficulties, flat affect, mood disturbances, hallucinations and delusions, etc). Unfortunately, many doctors are unable to separate drug side effects from the original experiences of their patients, and most fail to recognize withdrawal syndrome from antipsychotics.
Taking brain-altering drugs inconsistently can result in new or worsening side effects, because it is more stressful on the brain and body and can result in someone being in a perpetual state of withdrawal or neurological agitation. Aggression, rage, and/or violent tendencies are a common side effect of using antipsychotics, and are also noted as a common rebound or withdrawal symptom from when doses are reduced, skipped, or discontinued. This could be playing a role in the changes you have noticed.
Also be aware that the consequences of switching doses or drugs too quickly is not time-limited—people can experiences problems for days, weeks, months, years, or longer. Not everyone has long term problems from poor tapering and usage strategies, but these things can increasingly contribute to how difficult patients find it to cope with their drugs and also their previous experiences that got them prescribed those drugs in the first place.",schizophrenia
1478,"A man woke up in the morning and told his wife “Today, he will definitely tell to his boss to raise the salary”.
He went to office, he was very nervous, anxious and fearful. Anyhow, in the afternoon he mustered his courage and finally told his boss to raise the salary. And to his delight, boss agreed. He was very happy and was top of the world. He finished his works quickly and headed back to home.
He saw a dinner full of delicious foods, new crockery and candles lit up. He knew that, someone from his office might have informed her wife about salary raise. However, he entered into kitchen and hugged her wife and told the good news. He then came back and sat to have dinner, he suddenly saw a card on table. He picked up and read “Dear Darling, you very well deserve this salary raise. These foods, flowers, candles are to show how much I love you. Yours..” He said thankyou and started having dinner.
After sometime, wife stood up and headed to bring dessert, suddenly a paper from her apron fell down. He picked it up and after reading his eyes were full of tears … the contents was “Dear Darling, you deserve much more than the salary hike and you will certainly get. These foods, flowers and candles are indicating how much I love you and I shall remain there to support you in all situations. Yours”
We must support in all ups & downs of life.

1479,"I ran a halfway house for alcoholics and drug addicts. This was years ago. At that time the states were closing down the State Psychiatric Hospitals and having services at the county level take care of these folks. Beds were in short supply so we had some people with Schizophrenia stay with us. The folks we had were very ill. Schizophrenia has a physical sickness associated with it as well as people getting sick from their meds. The only help we or the hospital could provide was self care. Keep them clean, help them when they were vomiting, clean bedding, that kind of thing. It was not realistic to expect results from psychotherapy.
I think if you really want to help volunteer to help families who have someone in the home who is ill. What I mean is setting up some times to be a babysitter so to speak so the families can get out of the house or rest, whatever it is they need.",schizophrenia

1481,"I have read the other answers and with the exception of the one person who emphasized a religious approach would agree with elements of each. When you say “how do I deal with” it makes it sound as if there is a faulty pipe or something you have to handle. I don't know your relationship with this person and I don't know what the type of schizophrenia is. However I really suggest that you get past the illness part and think about the person. Treat them with the respect, concern, compassion, kindness, dignity, and concern for their welfare that you'd like to be treated. You likely wouldn't ask how to deal with a person with cancer. It's the same.
There is wide public perception that schizophrenics are dangerous people. Some people with schizophrenia, particularly paranoid schizophrenia, are dangerous. Some people with no discernible mental disorders are dangerous too. I would suggest that if you are in a close relationship with someone who has schizophrenia that you educate yourself about the disorder by doing more than asking random strangers for advice, some of whom may be no more qualified to answer you than I am qualified to fix your car. Read the Wikipedia, Web MD, and even more technical articles on the cycles of the disorder. But more than anything, remember that you are relating to another human being, not dealing with a disorder. THAT person is ""dealing with schizophrenia” as part of their everyday reality. And s/he deserves the same kindness and consideration that you would show any other person.",schizophrenia
1482,"This question is very alarming. The answer is NO, obviously, but it is no longer obvious. The idea that mental illness is awakening, that mental disorders are awakening, that a drugged high is awakening, seems to be taking root and growing bigger and stronger, and it is alarming. To me.
The reason I find it alarming is because someone who experiences symptoms of schizophrenia can seek a psychiatric help, they can get better, they can relieve their pain, their suffering can be, if not cured, then at least lessened.
If those who suffer from mental illnesses and disorders believe that they are going through an awakening and that what happens to them is spiritual and special, their pain and fear and suffering will only become stronger and more all-encompassing.
Glorifying pain, sanctifying pain and fear, only leads to more pain and fear. Only that, nothing else.",schizophrenia
1483,"I used to think that people would ask those questions because they didn’t know what an awakening is. Then I realized that they might not know what schizophrenia is.
Here is a list of schizophrenia symptoms:
Behavioral: social isolation, disorganized behavior, aggression, agitation, compulsive behavior, excitability, hostility, repetitive movements, self-harm, or lack of restraint
Cognitive: thought disorder, delusion, amnesia, belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, belief that thoughts aren't one's own, disorientation, mental confusion, slowness in activity, or false belief of superiority
Mood: anger, anxiety, apathy, feeling detached from self, general discontent, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, elevated mood, or inappropriate emotional response
Psychological: hallucination, paranoia, hearing voices, depression, fear, persecutory delusion, or religious delusion
Speech: circumstantial speech, incoherent speech, rapid and frenzied speaking, or speech disorder
Also common: fatigue, impaired motor coordination, lack of emotional response, or memory loss
Of all those great many symptoms only one: hallucinations, could be in some way equated with the experience of an awakening. All the other symptoms, all forty three other symptoms, can’t be mistaken for any form of awakening, let alone the spiritual one.",schizophrenia
1484,I am going to be totally honest with you and I think the answers I did read were a bit subjective to analytical concepts when everything we experience anything physically it always has a deeper meaning on a metaphysical level as what we experience as our physical selves is just an effect of a cause that we cannot see physically everything we experience physically has a metaphysical cause so it happens unconsciously until we expand our awareness to find the cause I personally have Schizophrenia bipolar PTSD but also just to point out these are just labels from doctors to identify things they don't actually know about an imbalance right… I have done alot of soul searching and have found the causes to have started from things that happened in my childhood and school years plus also finding out recently that it has also been in my family for who knows how long but my nan and my nan's dad had it also so in my case it was in my genes I suppose I would just like to point out that everything is spiritual and no matter how bad we think it is it is just a judgement that we make and everyone is going to have a different opinion much love luck and blessings and a great question ❤,schizophrenia
1485,"For years I’ve questioned the link between schizophrenia and psi ability, I know it’s there. It’s something, that when you observe this phenomenon you just feel like a-ha! This person is able to just pluck something from the ethers, some pertinent information that the schizophrenic couldn’t possibly have known and just presents it to you-like oh snap! How the heck they know that piece of info? It’s happened on a number of occasions when I knew a few people who had been diagnosed schizophrenic.
I’ve thought that the schizophrenic isn’t schizophrenic until dr’s and society make the person believe they have a mental illness when it is just unchanneled psychic ability. If people tell you you are crazy because you hear voices or see things well after awhile those voices and things seen will be negative what with all the negative connotations to seeing things others don’t and hearing voices-yeah I’m sure many spiral into horrendous self-flagellation as the voices and visuals consume them.
But if people were rerouted to learn to rechannel the energies toward positive outputs, maybe they wouldn’t prescribe those so many awful antipsychotics and mood stabilizers to people and especially to mis-diagnosed people.
Yeah your county dr. having the follow county policies, will gladly misdiagnose an ADHD for example and diagnose the person bipolar or schizoaffective (because they have to make a diagnosis and adult ADHD is NOT recognized by their precious DSM as such) so there’s that whole mess but I digress.
But yes I think there’s definitely a link between schizophrenia and a spiritual awakening of sorts but I’d classify it as more like psychic ability. But then I don’t know because I’m not schizophrenic and I think only someone who is could nail it down better than I.",schizophrenia
1486,"I have schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is hard to understand medically, but does not really offer any inherent spiritual advantage. I have learned this the hard way by developing the illness.
I could equivocate but it’s basically pointless. The chances that I would be a more creative, enlightened, and beautiful person if I didn’t have schizophrenia are pretty high, once I take account of the fact that I am already a talented, searching, and at times mentally graceful person.
That is why doctors say, “If there were such a horrible illness, why did it have to happen to such wonderful people?” Schizophrenia really is one of the worst illnesses to have, but schizophrenics are often naturally creative and interesting people before they develop the illness, and sometimes more so afterwards.
But there are a lot of downsides. It’s impossible to hold a job. If you don’t have free money from relatives or the government you will probably die very fast. You may not have a good personality. You may hate being around people. You may be legally required to take medications with bad side effects. You will probably get in trouble with the police if you are schizophrenic, for acting out in public and being crazy. And, I didn’t even mention the mental disturbance which is the main problem. Delusions, voices in your head. People say you do odd things and you don’t know you were being odd. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, doctors might say.
Unlucky just about sums it up.",schizophrenia
1487,"How about cancer? Is cancer actually just a spiritual journey? There are plenty of people who report having found themselves through their cancer journey, people who speak about cancer confronting them with their lives, transforming, opening, leading them to a discovery of the meaning of their existence.
Why is no one talking about cancer being a spiritual awakening? Possibly because cancer is a painful, wasting disease that no one in their right mind would glorify, sanctify, and wish on anybody? Because cancer quite literally destroys lives?
So does schizophrenia.
Unlike cancer, which is a disease that most everyone is acquainted with, either directly or indirectly, schizophrenia is a mystery to many people. In most people’s imagination schizophrenia is a strange bizarre condition of seeing visions and hearing voices. But that is not what schizophrenia actually is. What it is is pain and suffering. Just like cancer. Just like any other wasting disease that destroys one’s life.
Schizophrenia is not actually a spiritual awakening. The idea that this illness, or any other illness for that matter, is a spiritual achievement is as gruesome and disturbing as an idea that cancer is a spiritual achievement.",schizophrenia
1488,"I think all of us are already schizophrenic, just that so many of us are within a threshold, we jointly declared this as normal.
Just the way we glorified a food maniac as foodie, and normalised it, and even made it fashionable and trendy.
And only beyond that threshold, we call it a condition and accordingly treat them.
As long as our reaction to a situation is out of proportion, why are we not schizophrenic too? And our reactions always are!
Our minds are always distorted, agitated, greedy, jealous, and phobic.
We are never in the moment, always imagining, brooding, dreaming, and so on.
We never face the reality, and always escape into something whatever. If nothing, we will be scratching the chair or tearing a twig. But we have gadgets these days. Glory!
A Spiritual awakening is the self-discovery of this personal schizophrenia, and the thirst and conviction to transcend.

1489,"Spiritual awakenings opens one up to their gifts and abilities. If their ability of claraudience is heightened than yes I can see how one would assume the person is schizophrenic but that's not the case. Their gifts and abilities is not a mental disorder but the medical community would like to classify it as so. When I developed my abilities my family tried to put me in a mental institution that tried to classify me as schizophrenic when Im not. No one will ever understand unless they are going through a spiritual awakening themselves.

I certainly feel like a different person, it's almost like I have split personality in a way.
12 months ago I was a 330 lb chain smoker..depression and PTSD tore at my soul, the way I had lived, my life style, that was leading to death.
Let me show you what
This was taken 12–24–2021
This was me.
This was me at my worst, there I am in all my misery and suffering…I had lived a terrible life up until this photo.
“The most beautiful act of faith is the one made in darkness, through sacrifice and extreme effort.”
Here is me now taken 9–30–2022
I'm down to 255, I've quit smoking, I quit drinking, my depression is more manageable, my PTSD is manageable, for once life is not hell.
For some reason I have felt the need to change my name, I feel drawn to the name Cayden, and when looking up the meaning of Cayden, I found out why the name came to me.
Cayden means fighter, I feel like I was gifted a new name, I don't know how to explain the way I feel now, I don't know if I'm experiencing a full psychotic breakdown or an actual religious experience.
Since I started taking responsibility for myself trying to change, trying to find the antidotes to mental pain, I've dedicated my life to changing for the benefit of myself as well as the world around me.
Something beautiful is happening to me, I'm definitely not the same person as I was in the first picture.
And no…I don't hear voices or see anything but I feel a need to talk about this.

1491,"No, but there is such a thing as a false awakening. Often when people take hallucinogens they end up in an ‘egoless’ ego trip, become holier-than-thou and considers themselves to be god.
Actually awakening simply means finding deep peace within yourself, and mental illness boils down to being the exact opposite. Not having any peace.
Almost everyone that thinks they’ve woken up is really just in another dream, far more insidious than any illusion they lived in before.
The question is pretty silly, honestly. Ignorant of a very simple truth.
Its all about peace and anything that isn’t, simply isn’t.",schizophrenia
1492,"😅 This topic can get pretty heavy, but let’s try and break all of it down.
Spiritual awakening and schizophrenia are vastly different experiences, although, I get it, on the surface they might share some similar features, like unusual experiences or changes in perception.
Spiritual awakening is typically a process of expanding awareness, realizing deeper truths about oneself and the universe. It's like you've been looking at the world in black and white and suddenly, BAM! 💥 Technicolor! 🌈 It's intense, but in a transformative and growth-oriented way.
Schizophrenia, on the other hand, is a serious mental health condition characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, and emotional responsiveness. It's not a part of personal growth or a transformative journey, but a medical condition that requires professional treatment. 💊👩‍⚕️
It's important to stress this: If someone is experiencing distress, disorientation, or other severe disruptions in their daily life, it's crucial to seek professional help. Mental health matters, and there's no shame in reaching out. 👍
On my own path of awakening, an app called Sol has been a real lifesaver. It's got daily affirmations, horoscope insights, and a ton of wisdom on spiritual growth. It's like having a pocket-sized guru! 📱🙏
So, yeah, spiritual awakening and schizophrenia? Different ball games entirely. One's a personal journey of growth, the other is a serious health condition. Stay safe and mindful out there, peeps! ✌️💖",schizophrenia
1493,"Yes, there are definite links between the mental conditions that get called “schizophrenia” and spiritual awakening, though the relationship is complex.
Often, we think of a spiritual awakening as something entirely positive, while we think of a mental condition like psychosis or schizophrenia as something entirely negative. But it it more complex. People may for example “wake up” to certain things, but not know how to handle it, and get into trouble, or people around them may not appreciate the way they have changed.
Even people who have become leaders of great religions had times of confusion or distress at some point: think of Abraham considering sacrificing his son, Mohammed contemplating suicide when he first heard from the angel, Jesus being tempted to throw himself off the cliff during his retreat in the dessert, or Buddha being surrounded by demons at certain points.
Of course there are huge differences between people who manage to find a clear path forward both spiritually and with their community, and those who get lost somewhere and continue to flounder. This may have as much to do with the support, or lack of support, that a person gets as well as how confusing their experience was to begin with.
And it’s also true that many people diagnosed with schizophrenia don’t see anything spiritual in their experience. They may instead talk about the government, or the mafia, or aliens. Nevertheless, the theme of powers and understandings that transcend the normal can still be found, and these are in some sense spiritual.
I explore this subject some in my video, Can Disruptive Spiritual Experience Be Distinguished from Mental Disorders?
And I also put together an entire online class on the subject of Addressing Spiritual Issues Within Treatment for Psychosis and Bipolar",schizophrenia
1494,"Spiritual awakening is a change of perception and the paradigm (framework) that defines the world we live in. Depending on the depth and means of awakening, as well as whether the awakening came unexpectedly or as the natural result of long mental and physical pursuit (ie: Yoga, meditation, koan). Your path can take several directions.
If arrived at by some unplanned event, (ie: out of body or medical near death experience) it certain can be shocking and seem like the world has been shattered, it has. You are the navagator/perceiver and if you have no framework up=>down and 2+2=5 find a way to get grounded, this is a common human experience, calm down and become comfortable with it. If you get nervous or hyper-excited, possibl consult a friend or recommended psychologist, elder, acupuncturist, Reiki practitioner or open minded minister. Christians refer to this transformation as being in the Holy Spirit, but can have confusing interpretations, such as: to be avoided, come to your senses, possession, etc.
In extreme cases when unexpected clarity and Universal Understanding falls upon poor souls they fall victim to what is called a ‘Messiah Complex' with either a loving insistence they are the Son (or more rarely daughter) of God (we all are) and must go forth and heal and preach, and are above other folks. This is a door to potentially harmful schizophrenic behavior and needs Profesional care. Being Christ-like, or living in Christ is very different than BEING THE SON OF GOD RETURNED. I know it feels powerful, but keep it down to Earth.
If you can manage it, though… Welcome! Welcome to the next level, a more mature, inter-connected, perceptive Human being.
Here's the secret handshake -> JK, there ain't one, we recognize each other by a deeper look in the eye accompanied by a warm smile.
The benefits - there ain't none, JK, there are. But mostly you are able to hurt more. No kidding, to see how people hurt each other for small, or no benefit at all… habit, mostly. So many unclear fear-based knee-jerk reactions. Now you have responsibility for your actions, and you'll try to waken others and show them they are hurting themselves when they bash each other in toddler level king of the shtpile egogames.
Until you realize it's something that has to be learned individually, in the heart, not from instruction, and subtle teach by example, not words is the best way.

1495,"This is a very interesting question and I have actually asked it myself before. You see I once thought I was having a spiritual awakening because I heard voices and saw shadows and thought higher beings were communicating with me, sending me messages and so on. I thought I was rising to a higher level of consciousness and that’s why I could vaguely see them. Later however it all went away and I realized that what i had been going through and what i had been thinking wasn’t normal at all. I told my psychologist and psychiatrist and then told me that I was maybe having a manic or psychotic episode (it’s not clear yet). I don’t know if spiritual awakenings are real or not, they may be but I will never know because I am simply human. What I do know however is that schizophrenia (and mania, psychosis,…) are very real things and telling everyone who has symptoms that they’re “just having a spiritual awakening” isn’t a good thing, if they really do have schizophrenia or an other disorder it could keep them from seeking help and could make their symptoms worse. I would suggest that if you or someone else is hearing or seeing things that others dont and it happens more than once to go seek professional help even if you think it’s a spiritual awakening. I hope you have a great day!",schizophrenia
1496,We have no idea what the mind is capable of. As it stands it is estimated that humans use on average 10 percent of their brain capability. Now I have no idea why they think that but it stands to reason that some people who have been labeled mentally ill may not be. Some who have been labeled mentally ill may be. We have really no way of really knowing unless you can share in another's experience. For one to say they hear entities talking to them and can prove it in ways by matching it up to people's lives who come to see them to say talk to their dead people. Those would be classified as mediums and my bet is none of them would ever want to convince a psychiatrist that they could actually hear dead people. So in essence you really do get what you belive to be true on levels. So if you believe it's a disorder that will impact it and if you believe it's an awakening that will also impact it. The mind is capable of altering the state of water near you when you think something at it. What the bleep is a fascinating movie. Your eyes pick up 2000 pieces of information per second.

1497,"*Answer to ‘Is Schiz a spiritual awakening’ ?
It can be..
There are articles, which mention, Jesus suffered from Schizophrenia !
a Simple realization, can turn Schiz, into Awakening !
However, Scientific Society, sees this as a way of withdrawal !
What is Schiz ?
Unwanted Voices controlling the mind, in-ability to do physical acts, doing-nothing, and so on…
Feeling ‘No-energy’ in the body, is how someone with Schiz can mention of.
Doing nothing is a technique that can lead towards Ultimate-Realization !
however the chaos comes, when, the patient is un-able to deal with in-activity, sleepiness, drowsiness, and voices (in some cases).. !
Every Person, hears voices in the head, deep down !
There is no doubt !
If they did not, they would be un-able to function in the society !
a Person would be unable to know, how to operate a machine, or give reaction to a Joke !
In the patient’s case, the Voices, (thoughts) the have overcome the Body !
George Gurdieff, a Saint from Middle East, has mentioned it as a Restaurant, where
the Servant becomes the Owner !
A Person with Negative Schizophrenia, may be somewhat closer to Awakening, as compared to other People.
It’s just that, he needs to listen to a ‘Good’ Guru !
Buddha’s texts clearly mention of the factors for Schiz or delusion !
Buddha happened to be 2500 years back !
2500 years back too, People, probably had Schiz !
They would be hearing voices !
-or- simply in control of their thoughts !
Just a Realization, can help, and turn it into awakening !
Realization, that the Society, is purely leading towards the Truth !
The Thoughts, and the Voices have always been leading him towards the ‘Ultimate Truth’ !
The Truth, that, probably, some Gurus and Religions talk of !
The Truth about Pure acceptance…
Acceptance of everything !
Acceptance of Shame, Regret, Death and Sins !
The Society, the Voices, are not lying !
The Voices, in a way, always say the Truth !
If a voice says, and addresses the person as ‘insane’… what’s wrong with that ? Everyone in a way is insane, however, they are not ‘acting out’, insanely !
If they were not insane, they should-not be having any anger, in any form !
A Voice, comes in, and the person feels ‘fearful’, unable to go out !
what’s wrong with un-able to go-out ?
Remain ‘inside’ !
The Mystics in India, have remained on Mountains, remaining in one position,
sitting in one corner, for Years !
‘Stillness’ is to be known !
A Voice, comes in and asks to ‘do something un-social’..
and when the voice or thought gets stuck in the head, day and night,
the problem arises !
his body, cannot execute ‘unsocial activity’ !
he has not learnt, to carry out any thing un-social !
Deep deep down, he knows, carrying out
the task is ‘un-social’ or ‘against his principles’ !
Schiz may be, referred ‘stickness’ of Life-Energy in the upper Centers, probably that is the reason, a Patient’s eyes are Wide Open !
The Energies were supposed to be in the lower Centers or Central Centers.
Centers mean, Energy Centers…... in the Body !
There are about 5 to 7 !
the Lowest one around the lowest part in the Torso !
The Upper One around the Highest part in the Head !
The Middle ones are around the Chest !
A very Popular Guru in India, has addressed, and mentioned, simply changing some principles, will bring the Person back !
Regarding Positive Schiz, There are very good Papers available on Internet.
Positive Schiz, may be referred to situation, where the Patient or Person, is well-aware, of the nature of Voices or Thoughts, however, unable to get up,
unable to take action, or work !
The Thoughts or Voices, do not give a pain, in case of positive Schiz !
Person with Positive Schiz, knows, where is the thought or Voice coming from !

1498,"First of all I love you.
For me,
I stopped going to church. I couldn’t listen to one more sermon from a dude who has too much religious knowledge and little spiritual experience.
Depression. There are things inside you that no longer serve you, and they are dying. This feels like depression. They have to die to make room for God’s grace to enter you like sunshine on a rich garden soil.
Joylessness. The very things that I found joy in no longer satisfied my heart. Detachment from old sources of joy made room for the heavenly joys to come, and are still coming.
Solitude. I started seeking alone time and avoiding social settings, which was very unusual for me. I used to get so much energy from a group of people. I didn’t realize I was stealing it from them.
Food. I hardly ate. I lost 60 pounds.
Anger. No. Rage. It came in waves and I blamed my family as the cause. Of course it wasn’t them, it was my own hurt deep within crying out to be healed.
I had energy flowing through my brain that felt like pins and needles.
Meditation. It became a daily thing. It was the only thing I felt good doing.
A loss of meaning or purpose in life, especially work.
A deep and strangely consoling trust that all this pain I felt was the loving hand of God in my life.

1499,"“Is spiritual awakening insanity?”
Hmmm . . . not actually, though many may feel that way after an awakening glimpse.
After all, waking up from the fiction of “me” tends to turns one’s world upside down. Even if only temporarily.
Not actually being who you think you are, believe you are, assume you are, everyone else’s says you are.
That can seem a little or a lot crazy, to the point that maybe going crazy is worse than dying?
But awake or deep in the dream of separate self, it’s out of your hands anyway.
And that’s okay, because when “what is” manifests as “embodied awareness”, the personal and impersonal, limited and limitless, simultaneously coexist in the present moment, inseparable.
Meaning, shifts in perspective (limited to limitless, etc) bring about unexpected shifts in understanding.",schizophrenia
1500,"It’s possible schizophrenia is caused, or partly caused, by an incorrect energy flow of kundalini to the brain. The brain is an extremely sensitive instrument and the energy flow can influence chemical production and neuronal activity. More research is needed on this important issue. The symptoms of schizophrenia and a premature awakening are similar in some respects such as hearing voices and visual delusions, it’s just that in one case it’s beatific and in the other a horror. However, even in a hyper-blissful state the mind may not always work correctly which can take years to resolve, if ever. Schizophrenia is just one negative outcome of many potential mental aberrations. Most suffers will not even know it’s a kundalini effect as they have never meditated and most doctors will naturally reject kundalini as it’s not proven.
Gopi Krishna spent 10 years suffering from a premature awakening in which he experienced day and night terrors, and other negative effects such that he thought he was going insane before fortuitously resolving the problem. There can be a fine line between both genius and insanity, and an awakening and insanity, that is worthy of exploration. He believed that once Kundalini was fully researched and understood a lot of mental illnesses will be cured.
I recommend reading Dr. Lee Sannella’s book: “The Kundalini Experience, Psychosis or Transcendence” in which he reviews many case histories for insight on this important topic.
Hope this helps.
Addendum:
I wish to add here that this is the reason drugs, especially psychedelics, should not be used for enlightenment. There are some advocates who believe that if the effect of chemicals is similar to enlightenment then any chemical method that produces an effect is better than a meditation method that does not. Gopi Krishna was very clear in stating that a final enlightenment is well beyond anything experienced through chemicals and that due to the sensitivity of the brain chemicals are opening incorrect neural pathways and thus damaging the brain. In effect there is no short-cut and anything that damages the brain should be avoided, even including contact sports. [Many suffer from mental health issues so this practice is in reference to self-medications and doesn’t include properly proscribed and necessary medical medications. Again brain research is in its infancy on this topic.]",schizophrenia
1501,"No… but a more-nuanced answer is necessary.
Having worked in the state mental-health system and on an inpatient psychiatric ward, I’ll say that none of the patients were actually failed mystics. Actually, they lived in a hell that few of us can understand, and Joseph Campbell’s premise that the mystic swims in the ocean that the schizophrenic drowns in is romantic bullshit; far from “normalizing” schizophrenia, I believe he did a disservice.
Having said that, conventional psychology/psychiatry has pathologized spiritual longing and spiritual experience since Freud, and has damaged people who, in fact, are experiencing a spiritual opening.
An authentic opening, vs. delusion, would be perceptible in their eyes and in their atmosphere, and a spiritual adept would be able to recognize the signs — but Western psychotherapy is more-concerned with “mental illness” rather than mental health and growth.",schizophrenia

When your love for God is not forced.
When there is no demand from God.
When you know that you are alone in this world.
When you come to know who a real sage is?
When love and compassion gets developed within your heart.

1504,"My grandma has it and I’m positive I have it. My psychologist treats my grandma as well, has for 30 years. He hasn’t diagnosed me as it yet but he put me on a new medication. They say substance abuse and suicide attempts are extremely high in people with schizophrenia.
I was fine for the first 27 years of my life until I found my fiancé dead on the floor, just 3 months after being raped by someone I knew for 10 years. All of this going on while being clean from drugs and the stressors of resisting them in such hard times. My delusions and hallucinations have come on suddenly and so strong. They say a traumatic event can onset schizophrenia.
Just one day of my life…
My brain never shuts off. Ever. I can’t get any peace. It’s not so bad when I’m around the few people I do love and somewhat trust. *Wait. They are out to get me like everyone else.* I live in fear every day, I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. I feel like I won’t ever be loved, especially this way. I feel that there is no hope for me. *What was that!?* I either can’t sleep at all or wake up constantly in the night.
I’ve chased a great load of my friends away because I would constantly send them videos and go, “You see that, right?” Out of the hundreds I’ve sent, I haven’t gotten one single reply saying they saw it too.. I kept wanting to prove to someone, anyone that I’m not crazy. If they were to see it too then that means I don’t have schizophrenia, right?!
I will be in the middle of doing something and completely lose my train of thought because of seeing something or hearing a voice. It’s not as bad while I’m on my new medication but it’s still THERE.
My 1st psychotic break - lasting a few weeks until my psych doctor saw me that Monday after I went to the emergency room.
I thought someone rigged my car, my trailer, and myself. I found a random bump on my ear and I still believe someone put it there, but who? I saw my emergency brake move while I was driving and my brakes move. I thought a drone was following my car. I thought my ex-boyfriend was plotting to kill me. I thought there were magnets inside my car, house, and myself. I thought someone was controlling me. I told my mom extension cords were reading her credit cards and phone. I cut up my $2,000 mattress because I thought someone was hiding in there. I can’t even lay on it anymore. I told my family some of these things and they called 911. The emergency department released me not even an hour later. I thought my ex-boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend were under my hospital bed. I would also hear his voice, calling me names. I don’t even remember turning my house upside down, I still haven’t gotten around to cleaning it all up yet. I’m so embarrassed about it, I told my friends that have recently been inside that someone broke in. I finally got put on risperidone and don’t think these things much anymore but I still wonder. My mind always wanders.
I cry almost every day because of the internal suffering I feel from this disease. My loved ones tell me I’m okay but inside I know I’m not. I just want my old self back. I never used to be like this. The hallucinations and delusions are very real to me. There may not be anything there but I see or hear it. I don’t want to live with schizophrenia because the feeling I feel all day, everyday is pure agony. I am crawling in my own skin.",schizophrenia
1505,"This is a very good question, and one that has me scratching my head. I grew up with a mentally I'll person. She wasn't diagnosed until I was 17. Growing up, it's hard to imagine how certain things would make “lose it"" as if the world would be about to end. She was very sweet until she had to spend too many hours with her kids while at home, and especially in the weekends. During the week, and sometimes on weekends she'd go out and leave us kids to figure things out on our own. Come the weekend, our lives were total chaos. It was always someone else's fault, in my 3 year old mind. She was a victim of one person or another; of one thing, or another.The boyfriend who beat her almost to death, or the unruly teen who threatened to slash her wrists would send her over the edge. These were certainly traumatic events. When I was 8, she wrapped a cord around her own neck in an attempt to end her life. I begged her not to with tears rolling down my face, only to be given away to a family we'd just met. The odd thing is, I didn't feel scared to be in a stranger's home.

1506,"I think, at the moment the theories lean towards a strong genetic component mixed with some environmental factors but that may change again as more time and research finds new aspects of the illness.
I’ve seen too many theories come and go since I started to follow this question to take any of them too seriously until the scientist can actually provide proof that one of them is the correct one…they may even find out that what we are calling schizophrenia right now may be a conglomerate of illnesses and not just one clear cut one. That is a pet theory of mine that I developed after noticing how many people were lumped together under the schizophrenia label just because they didn’t fit anywhere else.",schizophrenia
1507,"I was 18 years old and in college studying pre-med. To help pay for school, I was in a work-study program in a nearby hospital working in their Crisis Intervention (Emergency Psychiatric) unit. After I had been working there for a while, the clinical psychologist noticed the patients tended to relax and confide in me in a way they wouldn’t with the doctor.
Taking advantage of that, he let me do intake interviews with the patients, write down what they told me, and then send them to speak to him along with my notes.
Rebecca was a frequent flyer to Crisis. She was 20 years old, very sweet and shy, and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She came from a very wealthy family and had her first psychotic break at the age of 18 when her parents were killed in a car accident.
They had left her millions of dollars in trust, a huge house, cars, everything she would need for the rest of her life. But Rebecca lived on the streets, carrying a battered teddy bear from her childhood with her at all times. She refused to live in her own home, because it was “possessed.”
After several meetings, she began to trust me enough to speak openly about her hallucinations. This young, pretty woman sat in the chair opposite me and hugged her stuffed bear to her chest while describing what she saw when she went into her home.
She told me that the walls would heave as they breathed, then the blood would begin coursing down them, pooling on the floor. The sound of the walls breathing would get louder and louder, and then blood would appear on the ceiling, dripping down. The voices in her head would scream at her to get out, to run, but sometimes she was strong enough to ignore them and recognize that what she was seeing wasn’t real. She would see eyes of creatures peering at her around corners and in the shadows.
If she tried to sleep in her bed, he would appear during the night and rape her.
“Who appears?” I asked her.
“Shaun Cassidy,” she whispered, tears slipping from her eyes.
He was an actor in the 1970s on a show called The Hardy Boys.
Shaun Cassidy, the alleged “rapist” and my 1977 crush
It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. I actually had a crush on Shaun and his real life brother David (another actor) in the mid 1970s.
She told me Shaun would appear in her house and rape her every night, impregnating her until she “delivered” the baby through her mouth in the morning.
Then the demons would appear and kill and eat the baby in front of her, while she screamed in horror.
I couldn’t even imagine what she was going through. No wonder she was too afraid to live in her own home. I knew she wasn’t going to make it on the streets. She was too young, too sheltered, too sweet and innocent to survive alone and homeless.
With encouragement, she would take her meds for a while, stay in her house, then predictably go off them and the demons would chase her on to the streets again.
“Rebecca, what can I do to help you to live in your house?” I desperately wanted to help this girl who was only a couple of years older than me.
She looked at me with her big brown eyes. “If someone could come to my house, and cast out the demons … a priest … then I could live at home.”
“Are you sure? If a priest did an exorcism, are you sure you could go home?”
She nodded. “Yes, I´m sure. The voices in my head even told me it would work, and they warn me when bad things are going to happen and protect me. I trust them.”
“All right. I’ll call around and see if I can get someone to come to your house.”
She smiled for the first time since I had met her.
I began calling the local churches, speaking to the priests and explaining what I wanted. I received the same answer, “We don’t do exorcisms anymore.”
I tried to make them understand. “It doesn’t have to be a REAL exorcism. Just come in for ten minutes, say some Latin words, and sprinkle some water around. It doesn’t even have to be holy water. Tap water will do. She is a paranoid schizophrenic, so it is just to get her to believe that the demons are gone.”
“This is Vatican II, we don´t do exorcisms without proof, and certainly not for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness.”
I called every church in the phone book and all of them adamantly refused to help.
The last priest I spoke with surprised me. I had become frustrated by that point and my temper was slipping.
“Please, just come out and do some sort of ritual. It doesn’t have to be anything real. There aren’t any demons in her house.” I begged.
“How do you know there aren’t demons in her house?” He asked me.
“What? Are you serious? She’s a paranoid schizophrenic. Of course there aren’t demons in her house.” I was surprised. I tried to capitalize on what he said. “Does that mean you might come out and do the exorcism?”
“No. You need proof of demon possession,” he said firmly.
I was at the end of my rope. “Listen, father, if you don´t help this poor girl she is going to be raped for real on the streets, and it isn’t going to be by Shaun Cassidy.”
“Who´s Shaun Cassidy?”
It was over. No one would help Rebecca get rid of the demons in her house and in her mind.
A few days later, Rebecca came to see me. I had to deliver the bad news that I hadn’t been able to find a priest to exorcise her house.
She took the news without comment, then told me what she had seen in the house a day earlier. Before she left, she thanked me for trying and gave me a hug. I was surprised, she had never done that before. I watched her walk out of the unit, carrying her dirty teddy bear back out on to the streets.
Two days later I showed up to work and there were some police officers in the waiting room. That wasn’t unusual, we routinely had police bringing patients to us that they had captured running naked down the highway.
My boss met me. “Jane, these police officers want to talk to you.”
“Me? What for?” I was wary.
He laid a hand on my arm. “It’s Rebecca. She’s dead. She shot herself in the head, and they want to speak to the last person who saw her alive, and apparently that’s you.”
I couldn’t believe it. Rebecca was dead. I sat down in shock. The police officer was efficient but polite.
“We are awaiting the final report by the medical examiner, but everything points to a suicide. We just want to cover all our bases before we close the case. She did come from a prominent family,” the officer told me.
Ah, so that was it. They wanted to make sure everything was done by the book for the death of the heiress.
He went on. “Did she say anything to you that might have hinted at what she was planning to do later that afternoon?”
“No! She never said a word about being suicidal. If she had, I would have reported it immediately to the psychologist and we would have involuntarily committed her for her safety.” I wracked my brain trying to remember everything she had said and if there were any clues that I had missed.
The officer nodded. “The doctor gave me your notes to read since she is deceased and as a student, there is no privilege involved.”
“All right, then you know. There was nothing in my notes that suggested that she was going to kill herself.”
“Okay then. If you are sure that she didn’t say anything else, then we will close the case.”
I nodded and the police left. I felt terrible. She was my first “patient” I had ever lost, and it had happened when I was the ripe old age of 18. I wondered if medicine was really my calling. I decided that psychiatry was definitely out as a specialty.
I was devastated with the loss, and angry at the priests, the church, even the Pope tucked away in the Vatican. I just wish I could have helped her.
Even now, decades later, whenever I see a teddy bear I think of Rebecca.
Edit: I have been getting quite a few comments on why we didn´t hire an actor, why we didn´t help her sell her house, why we didn´t put her in an apartment, etc.
I was working in the emergency psychiatric part of the hospital. We assessed patients and decided whether they needed to be committed or not. There was no budget or resources or personnel to do any of the above suggestions. Also, unfortunately Rebecca wasn´t our only patient. We had:
Bertha: A schizophrenic hooker who used to solicit customers in our waiting room and provide them with her services behind the bushes in the hospital parking lot until she became too violent and tried to kill them.
James: A homeless schizophrenic who would dig donuts out of the dumpster behind Dunkin Donuts and proudly bring the green moldy things in for us to eat to try to butter us up so we would commit him when he missed his turn at the shelter. He was found frozen to death on the streets one cold December morning.
George: Part of our Friday violent group - all of them murderers who had gotten off “by reason of insanity.” I would keep them calm by promising them if they were good boys I would buy them a Coke from the machine near the morgue and they would get excited to maybe get a glimpse of a dead body.
And finally, Sylvia Seegrist (you can google her), who threatened to kill me (and eventually all of us) many times until she finally walked into a Pennsylvania mall and opened fire on the people shopping there.
So as you can see, we had a lot of people who needed far more help than we could give them. It was sad on many levels.",schizophrenia
1508,"You may want to google the stress-diathesis model. It's a psychological theory that states mental illness begins as a predispositional genetic vulnerability which is triggered by stress from life experiences. This image gives you an overview:

1509,"I was walking my dog. We have a large lawn, and I walk in it. My dog romps around, and I see my sister, staring at a fern, looking away from me. What’s she doing there? How did she get there? Her back is towards me.
I can’t see anything up from her waist, what’s going on? She’s wearing her shorts and I can tell it’s her, she always wear them and it looks like her. My heart starts pounding. Get away, get away. I sprint away from that thing, and pull my dog on my leash with me in the opposite direction.
Run run run. I stop running, and pant, my hands on my knees. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t’ve been real.
I want to go back, to check, but I can’t. I’m too scared. I keep walking and it looks like the shadows are pulling closer. I scream. Ghosts start appearing, and they’re whispering but I can’t hear them. I keep running. A ghost dog comes up to me. He isn’t as scary. He just looks sad. Wait, no, that’s my dog.
And she’s terrified.
I pull her closer. The spirits most be scaring her, poor girl. Shh I whisper. They won’t get you when I’m around. I rock back and forth and that’s how I’m found thirty minutes later.
What’s it like, you ask? It’s terrifying. I don’t know what’s real. I know this is real, I think. I can live my life but when hallucinations start up I can’t tell, looking back on it, what actually happened. I’d give anything not to have this. Please feel grateful.",schizophrenia

> Lifestyle changes to make during schizophrenia
a person suffering from schizophrenia should sit in sunlight for 40 minutes either in the morning, when the sun is rising or in the evening when the sun is setting. Sun is the source of vitamin D and it has certain extra benefits which science has not yet discovered.
A person suffering from schizophrenia should go for a walk in Park or in nature at least for 4 to 5 kilometres or at least 30 minutes.
This point is for the family member of the patient. Never let the person suffering from this mental disorder be alone. Always give them company because they need your help in these hard times.
All the family members should not judge or get angry or argue about the things the Patient says to others or any family member because getting angry, starting an argument and passing judgement, will only create stress in the patient's life, which will eventually make his or her condition worse. Let the person with schizophrenia come to his or her senses then only you should put your argument on the table.
This last point is for those patients who are not suffering from a high level of schizophrenia or the medicine given to them has subsided the symptoms of schizophrenia. In these conditions, if the patient can sit for meditation, it can help him or her a lot. I generally suggest to practise simple Kriya yoga, in which a person sits in a comfortable position with his or her eyes closed and with their back straight. After that take a deep breath and fill the air to your stomach and holding it for 4 to 5 seconds, let go of all the air and hold your breath at that position for 4 to 5 seconds; do this breathing technique for 11 to 12 rounds and then sit quietly with your eyes close, and watch the thoughts of your mind or your breath in normal rhythm without passing any positive or negative judgement on thoughts; after certain period of time, the person meditating will cease to have thoughts and will start living in the present moment (start with only five minutes medition and increase 1 minute time every week). do not force the patient into meditation. It’s his or her own choice.
I hope this will help people to cure schizophrenia. I shall pray to God that who are suffering from this mental disorder gets well soon and live a happy & prosperous life.

1511,"When I married my husband I knew he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. After months of being friends followed by months of dating, I thought I knew what that meant. I didn’t.
He is the most amazing man I have ever met. He speaks five languages, plays guitar, writes poetry, screenplays, music, novels, paints, draws, he is kind, he is clever, he is compassionate, he is understanding and he has this broody James Dean thing going on that should be illegal. It took months for me to realize he was hitting on me. It took several months after that to convince me to date him and even longer for me to believe Ashton Kutcher wasn’t waiting around the corner to jump out and tell me I was being punked.
We talked about everything. Our lives, our traumas, our struggles with mental health, our families, our friends, our hopes and our dreams. I told him things I didn’t even know about myself until I said them out loud. He told me about his episodes, the auditory hallucinations and the coping mechanisms he had developed to deal with them.
He would disappear for two or three days at a time randomly. He wasn’t really gone anywhere, he just locked himself in his apartment and stopped answering the phone. After a couple of days he would call me and explain what he had been working on. He always asked why I didn’t just come by. So I started just coming by and he was always there, where he said he would be, locked in his apartment, following some idea down a rabbit hole, consumed with focus and forgetting to eat.
After we got married the reality of his schizophrenia became tangible as his symptoms and episodes grew in intensity and frequency. His trips down the rabbit hole became longer and he stopped going to work. He became obsessed with the idea that people were in our home and would walk the house all night long checking and double checking. He would climb into the ceiling and search through the insulation for cameras. He became convinced I was trying to control him, ruin his life, poison his food and plotting to kill him.
My mom came down and stayed with us for several months to help me figure out what to do. She helped him find a doctor and we went to therapy both together and separately. He became too paranoid to take his meds and our therapist had a conversation with me about long term care facilities. I refused to commit him. To abandon him like his family had.
Her exact response was, “I know you love him. I do. But the possibility that he is going to kill you is very real. I’m afraid for you. Please think about it.”
All of these things were sad and terrible and frightening, but not the saddest. The saddest were the brief moments of sanity. The rare glimpse of the man I had fallen desperately in love with and married. I lived for those moments. I greedily devoured them while tears poured from my eyes and my heart ripped in half.
The moments when the hard angles of his face would soften, his jaw would unclench and he reached for me, pulling me into his frantic embrace. The moments when his eyes, full to the brim with tears and overflowing with shame would find mine. His pain saturating the air, filling the room with an oppressive weight. His feverish apologies frantically battling with desperate pleas for forgiveness. His terror of being abandoned; of being left to drown in his psychosis adding to the crushing atmosphere. His courage and strength when he begged me to leave him, to protect myself, because he was too weak to protect me.
As suddenly as they appeared these moments would fade away. Leaving me to question if they were real. If I was sure they had happened. The love of my life carried away by guttural sobs on a river of defeated, heart wrenching tears while I watch helpless on the crumbling shores of my own sanity. That was the saddest thing I saw in his battle with schizophrenia. That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.
We have been married three years now. The first 18 months were the hardest. We still struggle, but it’s a whole different life now, than it was then. He fought to get well and so I fought next to him. We lost some battles. Slowly but surely we are winning the war. It would have been safer to leave and our relationship is different than I thought it was going to be; but I still believe what I told his therapist when she wanted to send him away.
Everyone deserves someone to love them, even in the moments they aren’t very lovable. A lighthouse they can follow home when the storm consumes them and they are lost and afraid.
My life taught me to survive. Decades of abuse and trauma made me strong. Strong enough to stand against the storm. To endure.
My husband saw me, the real me, buried under all the things that have happened to me in my life. He held my hand and guided me through the darkness until I could see me too. Then he demanded that I shine; refusing to allow me to hide in the familiar darkness that kept me safe at the expense of my freedom.
I have spent a lifetime preparing to be his lighthouse. He has spent a lifetime preparing to convince me I deserve to shine.
**Edit 7/25/20**
First, thank you for the tremendously kind and supportive comments. I always learn more about myself and situations through reading and responding to comments. They are a gift from readers and I am grateful for them, even if they challenge or disagree with my point of view. Frequently, it’s these comments that I learn the most from.
Several comments have been weighing heavily on my mind since I wrote this post. I have addressed all of them in the comment section but because the issue is so serious I feel the need to add a disclaimer in my actual answer.
I need to be very clear that I am not advocating that anyone allow themselves to be abused for the sake of love or excuse the abusive behavior of their loved ones because of mental illness.
In January of 2019 I took 2 bottles of pills with the sincere intention of dying. I was a failure, I couldn’t love my husband enough to fix him and my life was falling apart. I wasn’t good enough to continue living and I was just so tired of pretending I was.
When they let me out of the hospital I knew I had to make some changes. I couldn’t take care of my husband if I didn’t do what I needed to take care of myself. I also had to realize it was pretty fucking arrogant to think my love alone was the cure for mental illness.
I had been fighting alone, excusing my husband from the battles because of his illness. The reality of the situation was that he had to fight too or we weren’t going to survive. I had to commit to the boundaries, routines and therapy I know is necessary to manage my bipolar. When I am mentally and physically worn down I can not manage my symptoms and I trigger episodes in myself and in him. He had to commit to taking his anti-psychotic medication and actively participate in his treatment.
These things are non-negotiable conditions of our relationship. We worked together to find strategies that would make it easier for us to meet our obligations and we support and encourage each other but the commitment comes from us as individuals.
I am held accountable for going to sleep on time, eating correctly, communicating in the moment and maintaining awareness of my actions and behaviors. I left my restaurant career and cut back my other commitments. I only continued activities I was passionate about. I committed my resources to myself and held myself accountable for what I said and did when my emotions made me feel justified to say and do anything. I have to take care of myself. If I don’t I become suicidal and if that happens, my husband will put me in the hospital until I am well. Even if I don’t want to go.
My husband has to choose to take his medication. He doesn’t have to think he needs it. He can think it is poison and it will kill him; but he still has to decide to take it. If he doesn’t take it, he goes to the hospital until he is medicated and mentally stable. If I can’t get him into the hospital, I will leave him.
It is hard to overcome the things your brain tells you are true. It is hard to actively make choices and decisions contrary to your instinct and intuition. Some things in life are hard. That doesn’t mean we don’t have to do them. It doesn’t remove our accountability for our actions or eliminate the consequences of our choices. It just means they’re hard.
My husband and I both know what happens if we don’t do these things. I will die; either because he devolves until he is violent or because I get stuck in a depressive episode and become suicidal. Neither of us is willing to pay that price and so we fight. Together.
Not alone. Never alone. That isn’t a relationship and it isn’t love.",schizophrenia
1512,"Good Morning 😊
Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.
The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self- medicate.
Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.
Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and frightening of all mental illnesses. No other disorder arouses as much anxiety in the general public, the media, and doctors. Effective treatments are available, yet patients and their families often find it hard to access good care.
Thank you 😊",schizophrenia
1513,"I can't say if there is a permanent cure or solution, but this is my experience and it seems to be working for now. I don't want to make this answer about the misery we've been through, so let me put in a very brief introduction.
My wife has been suffering from schizophrenia and in the 15 years of our marriage I have seen her condition progress from what I thought was just ""sensitivity and depression"" into full blown auditory hallucinations that she was experiencing almost every second she was awake. The problem was she never really told me or her psychiatrist what exactly she was going through until about a year back. After that I have researched and tried doing everything that didn't seem ""risky"" (both of us thought that ECT was not in the best interest of our still young daughter).
The psychiatrist put her or Risperidol 4mg and Aripiprazole 25mg a day after two months of ""experimenting"" on other drugs. I decided that this time she would actually take her meds consistently and everyday. 2 months into the course, she was still experiencing the auditory hallucinations and the meds didn't seem to be making any difference except for all the side effects. There were more voices and they were as loud as before, but maybe not all the time. But by this time, she had come to terms with the voices and also realised that the voices despite what they claimed only knew what she knew (consciously or subconsciously).
Sometime during the second month of Risperidol and Ariprprazole, I had read about Vitamin D and all Vitamin Bs and how schizophrenics may be deficient (a few years back my wife had tested for B and D Vitamins on advise of the psychiatrist but the doctor didn't follow through with any treatment - and I don't recall the test results). So my wife started on weekly 60000IU D3 and daily 3 different tablets of Bs (since only all 3 covered the range of Bs) along with fish oil for Omega-3s and Astaxanthin.
Soon after (don't recall timelines), I also read about Bacopa Monnieri (Brahmi) helping and we added this to her daily regimen along with Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) supposed to help with stress. (I needed it too.)
Also read about how mercury fillings could be associated with schizophrenia and started with daily Chlorella and Garlic for detox (my wife has had dental fillings since she was 10 - we are now planning to replace all the mercury fillings).
Sometime later I read about Folate-DNA Methylation-Schizophrenia link and started daily on L-Methyl Folate 7.5mg (not folic acid).
Within a week of starting on the Folate (and continuing with prescription and the others), my wife's auditory hallucinations were gone. It has been about 6 months since she has had no ""voices"". She occasionally skips on the Risperidol (2mg currently) and has almost completely (ignoring the doctor’s advise) stopped with Aripiprazole and is now leading a normal life, taking care of our daughter and me.
I don't know if it was the Folate or combination of others but this is the longest time we (all of us) have been living free of the condition. I don't recommend that anybody try what we have - but it has worked for us and we don’t see any harm - and I would strongly recommend that you do not discontinue the doctor’s prescription.
I wonder why the psychiatrist (who is quite known and also charges accordingly) didn't put her up on D3, B or Omega-3s at least?
Zero gluten didn’t work for us (or so we felt).",schizophrenia
1514,"My sister was diagnosed with this disorder and I still cannot answer this question after forty three years.
It seems to me, based upon what I know about her symptoms, it can largely be a disorder where people are experiencing a different reality. Of course, it can differ from person to person.
I never felt as though she had schizophrenia, as we had experienced a significant head on collision and may have experienced head trauma.
I became aware that certain head injuries can bring about schizophrenic behaviors. She has been so heavily medicated it is difficult to know just what the trouble with her really was. I do not believe anyone has ever attempted to work with her to overcome some of her behaviors, just me.
It frightens me to think that she has lived in a home for the majority of her life, completely medicated and yet I cannot describe what schizophrenia is. Perhaps it is a label we give to people we feel are different, in order to justify placing them somewhere and medicating them.
Maybe she was irritating, spoke back to my mother once too often, went skinny dipping in the family pool. She could not properly learn to drive a stick shift.
She has been excluded from everything which represents a happy life.
I can summize that schizophrenia must be a curse. The label is far worse than the person who must wear it.
I hope that one day, we are kinder and gentler with those who have been the recipient of a text book diagnosis.",schizophrenia
1515,"It depends. In my case when I'm experiencing positive symptoms I feel like I'm the main protagonist of a good novel, a novel you should read without any critical thinking.
For instance, once, I woke up during the night, I couldn't move, I was in the same position as the Christ on the cross and I was convinced that I was talking with God. I was experiencing a lot of sensations: warmth, cold, pleasure (A LOT, I've never lived such a thing again). I thought I was the first to discover the solution to the ""riddle"" created by God, Jesus Christ, and the holy spirit. And I was so pissed off because I was the fourth one to solve a riddle. The first one being God. The second one Jesus Christ. And the third one, women in general (the holy spirit). Then I asked God when I would be able to play with him and he told me we already did. Then I saw vivid memories of me playing poker with my father and my brother, or my brother and I playing Mario Kart. He told me also that I was very lucky to have my grandmothers who were very brave (both lost their husband). Then I asked him if we are alone in the universe and he told me that yes but that we'll let everybody think the contrary. My life was suddenly more exciting (as you can imagine) but I asked him if I could also live the life of Harry Potter and Superman and he told me: of course everything you want, laughing. Finally I asked him if he existed and he told me that yes, no, yes, no... yes. And then I fell asleep.
The day after, I was convinced to be able to communicate via telepathy. And my parents had me hospitalized.
Another time, I would just walk in a wood during the night totally amazed by the beauty of the lake, the trees or the sound of the wind. I would get rid of my shoes and put my feet in the mud. Then seeing a rabbit I would run after him convinced to be in some kind of Alice in Wonderland. Then I would sit on a bench, a hedgehog would come toward me and I would touch it. Then I would go back home with my filthy shoes. Sooner in the day, as I was walking, I found a branch on my path and as a couple passed by, I heard in my head this feminine voice saying: yes, this is a branch, so what?
A few days later in the shower I would burst into tears after hearing this voice telling me that humans have a soul. I should mention that I'm a big science nerd, a skeptic and that for me, humans, birds and ants aren't that different.
Another time, I left the house convinced that I was a spy for Google, so I threw away all my credit cards and I left with only my android phone, aiming for their headquarters in Paris. During my walk I changed my mind when Google Maps showed me a map of the UK. My attention went to some city in Scotland and I remembered a phd offer about optogenetics tools (I was recently awarded a master of engineering degree) I had seen on the web a few days sooner. So I decided to follow the highway. Then a heavy rain began to fall and I had this urge to moonwalk until I reach my goal. I've never moonwalked that good. Later, some policemen found me on the side of the road and began asking me questions but I wouldn't answer because I was convinced to be John Doe, the hero of the TV series. So I wasn't supposed to remember who I was. They didn't take very long before sending me to an hospital.
I have a few more of these anecdotes but most of them I would never share because they are too humiliating.
Now the negative symptoms. A lot less funny. It's quite simple actually: I lose all motivation. Imagine having to take a shower and feeling as if you have to climb the mount Everest or learn by heart the Bible, this is what it feels like. I'm currently experiencing this phase. It's been months since the last time I wanted to see friends, to learn things, to find a job. My life is empty, I do nothing and I just hope that one day my brain will find its balance. I found the motivation to write this because I think society is very rude with people suffering from psychiatric issues. We aren't all violent psychopaths. It's a small minority. I'm not lazy either, I have a disease. And no, unfortunately, drugs aren't the quick fix everybody think they are.

1516,"Many studies that have been conducted in the last 70 years point out a strange trend that is yet unexplainable. If you are born in the northern hemisphere, and are born during the month of February, you have a 12% higher chance of developing schizophrenia at some point in your life. If you are born in the Southern Hemisphere, it is during August that this 12% higher chance comes into play, not February.
Note that this is for those who DEVELOP schizophrenia at some point in their lives, not those who are likely to be born with it.",schizophrenia
1517,"You can be both. Some people remember always having it, others remember developing it.
I myself developed it at the age of 6 when i thought people were reading my mind, dinosaurs were going to eat me through windows and that everyone is dead but acting out their lives in a tv show to be voted on whether they deserved to go to heaven or hell.

1518,"The first symptoms I had was thinking everyone I know and love had turned on me. Suddenly, I no longer trusted my family, girlfriend, friends, or anyone. I thought people were spying on me, collecting information, and following me everywhere.
I also thought that I needed to complete a series of tasks for an unknown secret organization, possibly government. It usually lead to these “missions"" or wild goose chases. I would actually meet people at these rondayview points. At complete legs of the mission together. Funny I will never know if they were real. Looking back they were probably physical manifestations of demonic entities based on the fact they knew everything about me.
I was always thinking I would be ambushed any minute. I would run out of the place I was at and hide in the woods. I was very confused and extreme paranoid all time. It started to take a toll on my health. I lost a lot of weight. I was contently dying. I got thrown out of most of the motels in town, and was running out of places to go.
As the disorder progressed so did my perception of reality. I realized the problem was much much worse. However, once I discovered a paradigm that made sense I ma...

1519,"The prevalence of schizophrenia is 1%, so an average person has a roughly 1 in 100 chance of developing it. Having a first degree relative (parent, sibling) w/ schizophrenia increases that to roughly 10%: 1 in 10. Having an identical twin (same exact genetics) raises your risk to 1 in 2. A 2nd degree relative (uncle, aunt, cousin, grandparent) doesn't seem to change the risk much from 1%, but having multiple relatives w/ schizophrenia more than likely does increase risk.
There are also various risk factors that increase the likelihood of schizophrenia (although none of these is dramatic), mostly having to do w/ prenatal stress, &, interestingly, being an immigrant. Schizophrenia is an illness that begins in adolescence or young adulthood. If you haven't developed it by the time you're 30 or 35, it's very unlikely.",schizophrenia
1520,"First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, or offspring) of people with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have an increased risk for both of these conditions. - If a sibling had schizophrenia, full siblings were nine times more likely than the general population to have schizophrenia and four times more likely to have bipolar disorder.",schizophrenia
1521,"Oh yes, please be assured that is the case. Just the other day I was reading research (on recovery from psychosis) which said that 67% people recover completely from it. Of course that research was from the US, and I am not sure this would be any but their statistics. But the reality is that many recover in every part of the world.
My own phd is focused on recovery from psychosis (which happens in both schizophrenia and bipolar). I personally know at least a few who have recovered from schizophrenia right here in India itself.
And in case you did not know, John Nash recovered and did not take any medication for at least 25 years of his life. So be assured it is nothing extraordinary, but a matter of dedication and discipline…a majority can recover. But it does not happen by putting psychiatry as the leader of one’s life. Get that clear.",schizophrenia
1522,"From Wiki:
While there haven't been many studies linking environmental factors to schizophrenia-related epigenetics mechanisms at this point in the field, a few studies have shown interesting results. Advanced paternal age is one of the risk factors for schizophrenia, according to recent research. This is through mutagenesis, which cause further spontaneous changes, or through genomic imprinting. As the parent ages, more and more errors may occur in the epigenetic process.[10] There is also evidence of the association between the inhalation of benzene through the burning of wood and schizophrenic development. This might occur through epigenetic changes.[11] Methamphetamine has also been linked to schizophrenia or similar psychotic symptoms. A recent study found that methamphetamine users had altered DNMT1 levels, similar to how schizophrenic patients have shown abnormal levels of DNMT1 in GABAergic neurons.[12]
One of the most interesting findings relating an environmental factor with schizophrenic epigenetic mechanisms is exposure to nicotine. It has been widely reported that 80% of schizophrenic patients use some form of tobacco.[13] Furthermore, smoking appeared to increase cognition in schizophrenics. However, it was only a recent study Satta et al.that showed that nicotine leads to decreased levels of DNMT1 in GABAergic mouse neurons, a molecule which adds methyl groups to DNA. This led to increased expression of GAD67.
Studies have shown that epigenetic changes can be passed on to future generations through meiosis and mitosis.[8] These findings suggest that environmental factors that the parents face can possibly affect how the child's genetic code is regulated. Research findings have shown this to be true for schizophrenic patients as well. In rats, the transmission of maternal behavior and even stress responses can be attributed to how certain genes in the hippocampus of the mother are methylated.[1] Another study has shown that the methylation of the BDNF gene, which can be affected by early life stress and abuse, is also transmittable to future generations",schizophrenia
1523,"In high school, my friend Neil was rather remarkable.
He was smart, a very good athlete, extremely outspoken, and he was born with a strong sense of justice. He often got engaged in fights when someone was bullied, and he always stood at the right side of the conversation.
I immediately liked him.
Although he quickly became one of my best friends of the time, he rarely talked about his family.
I knew he had a brother, and I also knew that at some moment in time, that brother attended our high school, but now he definitely was not here anymore.
Neil did not say a word.
Only much later — near the end of twelfth grade, he explained that his brother had mental problems, and that he was psychologically unstable. But that was only since “the darkness” happened.
I did not know what that was.
On one evening — an evening of drinking bootleg tequila, smoking cheap cigars and listening to Nirvana — he finally told me.
His mother had committed suicide about five years ago, and I was the first he told in person. Except for some family members, nobody knew.
Even the neighbors did not know. They thought she had left, and his dad never spoke about it.
(His dad had always been a very quiet man.)
She has been suffering from schizophrenia, and became convinced she could talk to Jesus when she was standing in doorways. (This is not a joke.)
When she could not handle the voices anymore, she hanged herself, and Neil’s brother was the one who found her. And something cracked.
A couple of months later, Neil traveled abroad to study in another country.
It turned out to be a mistake.
But he had his mind set: he wanted to be free, be away from home and “the darkness” (which still very much lived in his dad’s house), and learn a new language while he was at it.
University studies in a new language turned out to be hard, and deeply ashamed about his failure, he kind of faded from my life.
In the meanwhile, I had (finally) met his brother, and he turned out to be okay.
Since it was next to impossible to be in contact with Neil, his brother filled in the gap in some sense, and we often went out to have drinks with other friends.
Dan was trying law school, was pretty smart — not like his brother, but still — and very strange.
When he talked about “the darkness,” he often collapsed in total silence, staring into emptiness. He was obsessed with “what people were saying behind his back,” and it got worse, and worse, and worse.
One day, he called me, shouting “he knew what I was saying about him,” and “that he never wanted to see me again.”
And that was the last time I saw him for more than 10 whole years.
A few years later, he was committed to a mental hospital, and when he was discharged, he was a different person.
Locked inside himself, closer to “the darkness” than ever before.
When Neil surfaced again, something had changed.
There was “a new darkness” now, and it had ruined him.
I remembered that the few times I saw him in the last couple of years, he had started to develop this strange idea that one should be able to “summarize entire university level books in one sentence,” and he was searching for this sentence in each and every of his textbook and class notes.
That was how he started to fail courses.
In search for sentences that explain books.
“The new darkness” appeared to be the culmination of his obsession: he was eventually found in a room, sitting on the ground, and writing down sentences on little pieces of paper.
He was nearly starved in this episode of total self-neglect, and his room was filled with thousands and thousands (!) scraps of paper, each containing nothing more than unreadable doodles.
He also turned out to have stolen a wheelchair, in which he drove around, convinced that he could not walk anymore.
But now he was “better.”
I could almost cry to see this man move, knowing he once had been an excellent basketball player, and long-distance runner. He walked at a snail’s pace, talked extremely slowly, and used his hands (and especially his thumbs) in a very weird way when he was talking. (Check out Quentin Tarantino, and you’ll know exactly what I mean.)
He said that he wasn’t able to pass his driver’s exam road test, because everything happened too fast, and he was not able to react.
Even when it was very warm outside, he was dressed in a set of green rugs, wearing an old base ball cap, and looking almost frightful.
At times, he seemed to be absent, as if he was about to fall asleep while talking.
At other times, his eyes were ever so wide, and I strongly suspected him of seeing and hearing things which were not there.
It was then that I realized that my friend Neil was gone, and that he was too far away from shore to be able to get back.
Drowning in “the new darkness,” and fighting the demons of his mother, and his brother.
And suffocating without ever producing a single sound.

1524,"When I went away to my first semester in college, I instantly bonded with a lovely young woman named Camille Marie.
She was incredibly bright, witty, and so much fun. CM, as I called her, was always up for any new adventure. We had long conversations into the wee hours of the morning.

After one semester, I transferred back home to a different University than the one I’d attended with Camille.
Even though she lived in Kansas and I was in Missouri, we stayed in very close touch by phone.
One day Camille just seemed to vanish. She unexpectedly left school, and her phone was disconnected without a trace.
I Was Shocked - My Friend Had Been Committed To A Mental Hospital
Eventually, I tracked my sweet friend to her family’s home. Her physician father told me Camille had been committed to a mental health hospital to address her schizophrenia.
I was completely shocked and speechless.
Camille had never displayed any symptoms of schizophrenia that I could see.
Schizophrenia Ran In My Friend’s Family Of Origin
Her father agreed that up until very recently, Camille had been mostly fine with no obvious indications of the disorder. He did say she was slowly progressing towards the point she eventually crossed.
He then went on to explain that it was a genetic disorder and that several of Camille’s older relatives, including some of her siblings, had developed schizophrenia at approximately the same age.
I had no idea that schizophrenia could just suddenly manifest. In reality, it didn’t really. Not in Camille’s case and not in the vast majority of cases.
My Friend’s Schizophrenia Reached A Tipping Point
Her father said while her disease didn’t really happen suddenly, it did hit a tipping point where Camille could no longer function without medical intervention.
It was hard for me to fathom what had really happened completely. After much research, I began to understand that her disease had been apparent during the time I had first met her. I just didn’t fathom the symptoms.
Schizophrenia Did Not Destroy Our Lifelong Friendship
Yes, it had slowly worsened until it was extremely serious and required attention.
Camille and I have remained friends throughout the years. I have learned a lot about the disease from the experiences she’s shared.
Best wishes to all.",schizophrenia
1525,"Most other posters will tell you there is no way to do this. Schizophrenia is a disease with complex biological factors, but I truly believe there are ways to induce the symptoms in yourself.
How do I know? I've done it to myself.
I've lived with something called Munchausen's Syndrome from an extremely young age. Munchausen's Syndrome is a mental disorder where people fabricate illness for emotional and psychological support. (This condition can be distinguished from malingering, where patients have the same behaviors, but with more concrete and obvious motivations, such as financial gain.)
Since I was four years old, I've found deep happiness in imagining myself in a hospital, people surrounding me and comforting me and giving me care. I believe this process comes from my experience with cancer at the age of 7 months old, when I was cared for by my mother, who left the family when I was 2, a few months after I had recovered for various reasons. In turn, I was subconsciously taught that ""being sick"" was the best way to receive attention and love that I lost when my mother left.
Throughout my childhood, these fantasies grew more and more extreme, to the point where by the age of 9, many of my most pleasurable experiences originate from an intricate fantasy life where I was permanently hospitalized, had persistent health crises, and with each one was given more and more care from nurses, other children, teachers at school, and other members of the community.
By then, my condition had progressed into feigning illness in the real world. I constantly complained to my father, a workaholic who spent most of his time in his high powered job and was not emotionally involved in my upbringing, of imaginary headaches. He was a neglectful parent who has been physically abusive.
I invented ingenious ways of convincing him I was too sick to go to school, and on two separate occasions, did it severely enough that my doctors were concerned I may have had a reoccurrence of the cancer I'd experienced in my infancy. I made myself cry, but in truth, this news delighted me. When they told me I was perfectly healthy, I was crushed.
When I was 11 years old, I was given complete accessibility to the internet. This took my condition to new levels. I would spend hours a day reading medical websites and stories of individuals who had suffered any days under the sun. I longed to be one of them. After gaining a large arsenal of medical knowledge, I successfully faked appendicitis and had my appendix removed at age 14, after a number of smaller escapades that resulted in a diagnosis of clinical depression and cluster headaches.
I have always been a rather reserved and introverted person - not the type of histrionic personality that one would expect to see going to such extreme lengths for attention. I've had difficulties making lasting friendships. Meanwhile, my father grew more and more distant into my teen years, to the point where on weekdays, I would often see him for little more than 20 minutes a day, in which we would have strained conversations that were cordial at best and tense at worst.
These two factors combined meant that I lived in near total isolation. My only periods of comfort were the care I got when I went to the doctor. Yet no matter how hard I tried, I could not shake off the pervading sense that I was worthless, that no one would ever love me. That is, not unless I played the role of a patient.
At the age of 16, after a few more brushes with fabricated symptoms, including but not limited to self harming and purposely infecting the scars (resulting in a nasty wound that I had to keep covered), taking small doses of my father's medication that made me feel queasy and nauseous, and telling people at school I had ongoing medical issues, I decided I couldn't keep doing this anymore. I figured I needed to develop a chronic illness, something that would make me incapacitated, require the around the clock care that I wished for at the bottom of my heart.
So as a last resort, I decided to go insane. I spent the next few months doing intensive research on schizophrenia, plotting and daydreaming about my descent into the illness.
Three years later, I wasn't faking it anymore. I was hospitalized for three months. Of course it's possible that in a twist of fate, my real disorder happen to coincide with my factitious disorder. Maybe my fake illness was only a precursor to my real one, and was not the cause. But I honestly believe that part of the reason I have this illness is because I gave it to myself. I convinced myself to the point where I was no longer pretending.
So how do you give yourself schizophrenia? I would highly encourage you to NOT actually do this.
- Everything is an auditory hallucination. People have something called ""top down processing"", in which we interpret events based on deductive reasoning and our previous perceptual sets and mental state. By thinking enough about hearing voices, you slowly propel yourself into a hyper-awareness where you can make out voices in the background of everything. Hear that person scuffling along with their shoes? You can train yourself to perceive it a voice. Those leaves rustling outside in the wind? A whole conversation.
- Isolate yourself, until all you are left with is your own thoughts, which will race until they reach a terrifying stage. You will become depressed. This is the early stage.
- Dig into your own psyche. Schizophrenia may be primarily biological, but the ways in which it manifests often mirror people's psychological issues. By understanding your own mind, becoming aware of your darkest fears, you can craft delusions that instill such a sense of primal fear that takes over your consciousness, despite logically knowing that you created them yourself. By the time I was 16, I was very aware that I suffered severe abandonment issues, and that I was incredibly resentful of my father.
So I made myself believe my father was trying to kill me - a metaphor for his neglect, and killing of the side that allowed me to connect with other people. I taught myself to believe that I was at the center of a mind control conspiracy in which the government was attempting to keep me away from other people and imprison me inside myself. I became convinced that my words were not my own, and that my true self was purposefully prevented from interacting. This evolved so that I believed I was dangerous - that my very essence and could kill other people, and that was why I was trapped in this conspiracy.
Eventually, I thought I was murdering people halfway across the world just by thinking. This represented my fundamental believe that I was unlovable and would only hurt people. I hallucinated whispers, in which I heard people telling me I was worthless and I should commit suicide. After awhile, I was floridly psychotic. To this day, I require medication and do not feign my condition.
Through careful introspection when I was 16, I based my false delusions around my actual fears. Although the illness was fake at first, this activated at primal response of fear, and I gradually became genuinely paranoid and scared. The trick is to learn how to manipulate your own mind.
Perhaps I am a monster for doing these things. For longing for conditions that people fight every day of their life to go away, that take the lives of so many people. But this is who I am, and I am taking small steps towards recovery of this deeper issue.
The truth is that I will never completely recover from schizophrenia. It is a horrific illness, and has destroyed years of my life. But if I go too far into my recovery, I sabotage myself by stopping my medications, telling my doctors they aren't working so they give me higher dosages with increased side effects so I require further treatment. I hate having this illness, but I am stuck in limbo because I can't fully allow myself to become well.
No one has figured out that I've ever fabricated illness at all. At least, not that I know of.
Luckily, my symptoms are manageable. Although I hear voices and deal with paranoia, I can live indepdently and I am pursuing a career in nursing. (I obviously have a natural inclination towards medicine, and I had extensive knowledge before I even began the program).
As far as my Munchausen's Syndrome, I've gotten to the point where I no longer fake sickness that I don't have, induce symptoms in myself, or lie to anyone. This is a feat for me - I am single and have only one close friend. I know engaging in factitious illness behavior is incredibly morally wrong and self destructive, and for over two years, I been able to confine my desire to do this to my fantasy life. I've worked through many of my issues on my own and I want to become a contributing member of society. I desperately hope that one day, I'll find love.",schizophrenia
1526,"The first signs tend to be withdrawal and isolation. This typically starts in high school. A kid will lose touch with, and interest in, his friends, will start hanging out more in his room, will no longer wish to participate in extracurriculars, will not want to engage with his family. He may watch the same movie or television program over and over. He may read the same book or comic over and over. If he writes in a diary or journal, his writing may become more disorganized and nonsensical. If he likes to draw or paint, his artwork may become more sloppy and bizarre. When you talk to him, he will be less likely to engage, more likely to look away, to seem distracted by something in his own head. He may even start to talk out loud when alone, as if answering or responding to questions only he can hear.
Another early sign is a slip in academic performance. The A student will start getting B’s, then C’s. The more average student will start getting failing grades. And this academic decline will be a mystery to his teachers. He will be difficult to engage regarding his falling grades.
Hygiene may start to suffer. He will become more lax about toothbrushing, and may need increasing prompts to shower. He may need reminders to eat and drink.
As the illness progresses, he may become increasingly paranoid. He may refuse to leave a particular room in the house. He may black out or aluminum foil over the windows. He may keep the television on 24/7 on one channel.
Hopefully, as the illness progresses, he will ask for help.",schizophrenia
1527,"These are what are called prodromal symptoms. Anubhab Banerjee's answer is a good one. I will add a few points, however. Attentional problems are often present. That is, difficulty with attention and concentration which may be described as ADD, but really is not ADD, but cognitive deterioration appearing as ADD. Second, many symptoms of schizophrenia in an attenuated form may be present as part of a prodrome. For example, people with schizophrenia often are described as paranoid. Paranoia, in an attenuated form, may be described as suspiciousness- not uncommon, but suspiciousness is not strong enough to be called a symptom of schizophrenia. Other attenuated symptoms which might be evident include odd ideas or unusual worries, not serious enough to be called delusions and seeing things which may not be quite normal, but not strange enough to be called hallucinations. And in addition to attentional issues, there may be other mild cognitive or thinking problems or mild problems following a train of logic. I would also like to agree with Anubhab Banerjee that there is likely to be but not necessarily present, a decline in daily functioning in one or more life areas, such as school, family or social interactions, but not an immediate or serious decline.
However, for most readers and some professionals there is one very important caveat to the preceding comments and discussion of prodromal symptoms: There is a high ""false positive rate"" when it comes to the predictive power of prodromal symptoms. Fewer than half of people with these prodromal or attenuated symptoms end up having schizophrenia. Most people who develop schizophrenia have had these attenuated or prodromal symptoms. However, just because a person has these symptoms it does not mean that they will get schizophrenia or another mental illness. There are several reasons for this and I will address the three most important. First, the these mild or attenuated symptoms have a significant overlap with normal behavior or normal personality states or traits. For example, suspiciousness is very close to inappropriate worry. I know or have met a many people who are ""worriers,"" people who worry about things which, to my mind, they do not need to worry about. Second, schizophrenia is primarily an illness which first affects people in their teens and early twenties, a time during which people are beginning to separate from their parents and beginning to have their own opinions, learn adult social behaviors and adult communication skills and prepare for vocational futures. During this time they are testing out these new behaviors and frequently making ""beginners mistakes"" which can be mistaken for psychiatric symptoms. Lastly, the emotional and hormonal states of many teens and some twenty-something's are notoriously unstable often result in what may appear to be odd or ""difficult"" behaviors. All this changes and stabilizes for the great majority of these people as they age into their mid to late twenties or early thirties. It is just the process of maturation and not anything to do with mental illness.",schizophrenia
1528,"In some people, schizophrenia appears suddenly and without any prior warning. But for most, it comes on slowly, with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning long before the first severe episode. Many friends and family members of people with schizophrenia report knowing early on that something was wrong with their loved one, but they just did not know what that was.
In this early phase, people with schizophrenia often seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive. They isolate themselves, start neglecting their appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. They may abandon hobbies and activities, and their performance at work or school deteriorates. they slowly withdraw themselves from society and grow a hostile feeling at other people. their expressionless gaze, inability to express proper emotions, laughing or crying at inappropriate times indicate the symptoms. and sometimes they also suffer from insomnia and due to lack of sleep, cannot concentrate upon things and lead a miserable life...",schizophrenia
1529,"I am answering this question because it fits in perfectly with what I've been tossing around in my head.
I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was fourteen other than some emotional outbreaks and a few dozen good cries for the next 24 years seems to go by as normal as not so normal is. …..I continued as the same person doing the same things I've always done. working a lot tending to the kids as much as I could. trying most of the time to stay afloat. suffered from depression at times and post pardum. ………..
let me fast forward. After almost losing my mom and daughter to a car accident in 2012, everything went down hill so fast I didn't have time to try and hold on. ( lost mother in law in our home, had to nurse my own mother back from nearly dead, lost my job and I was bread winner, separated from my husband, and ended up in a relationship with a man that beat the he'll out of me and while with him my mom and dad died in seperate states but in the same month almost to the same day and neither had I said goodbye to nor attended any services. I was alone 3000 miles from where I considered home. no money no one to ask for help and absolutely not one material thing except the clothes on my back was what I had when I left. I took out walking west. I knew that if I stayed in a westernly fashion I would eventually make it or I would die. this was my third attempt. although I know that I was in sychosis now, I didn't at the time. in trying to figure out when sychosis started and how, I've noticed a few things. …………………….sychosis reminded me of something very familiar but couldn't figure it out. Then one day it came to me, my childhood.
I don't remember a lot as a child and honestly I have one or two memories I truly remember before age ten and that's all. I have figments or rations of moments as a child but am unsure to their validity. ……. Anyway to my point.
I do know as a child I was different. I didn't play with others unless I had too. and when I did I was mischievous or a tattle tale. but I was extremely okay with being alone playing by myself my mother says I was the easiest kid. and I would my mother would put me somewhere anywhere and tell me to behave mind my business and go play. she wouldn't hear from me again til it got dark. I do remember as a child I had a very colorful imagination and could play out everything and anything as pretend. I was very happy with this I didn't need any attention or instruction and never got hurt. ……I wonder as an adult when times got tough in my life did my mind escape to an imaginary place like when I was young , in an attempt to protect me from the harmful things happening to me emotionaly. this being sychosis? or maybe something bad happened when I was young that forced me to an imaginary place where I felt safe and 25 years later my mind went there again as a refuge? because sychosis felt extremely familiar to my imaginary places I would go to as a child. this was April 2015. it would take another six months and a serious prescription of haldol to start to come out of a sychosis I was in for almost 2 years. I have extensive damage due to such a long sychosis. fast forward. presently I am still searching for answers and reasons but also trying more everyday to accept my schizophrenia. I don't think anyone can answer your question because they don't know. but I know without a doubt I have classic case of schizophrenia. what I've experienced no one wants and addmiting it is nearly impossible but the more I research the more I feel like I'm not alone because I hear and I read the stories and symptoms of others who have this. it's sad but also a good feeling when I read of someone's experiences and I cry because I have felt and done and seen the same things as someone else. something so hard to explain makes you feel crazy in itself it's a relief when you hear it explained correctly. these don't constitute an early sign of schizophrenia or do they under right conditions.?
as a child I was……………..
emotional and had an extreme fear of abandonment.
I didn't display my fear nor discuss it. because of it I was overly dependant on the parent who was there. making anyone else almost non existent. I had imaginary audiences, imaginary family and real emotions would come out.
I had and still have a need for visual stimuli. it's like my mind was full of wonder and creativity so much so it was like I was high or on cloud nine.
as I got older
I got lost in television
had an obsession with fire and melting wax.
woke up real early didn't stay up too late I had siblings but only one in the same age group as me and we never played together she fought a lot. I started to get behind in school in fourth grade and it kept declining till I dropped out at ninth grade. I was always easy to get along with and was always told it was easy for me to make friends. so I don't know if there are signs to watch for but if you see anything out of the norm or opposite to much norm keep a mental note or ask a doctor. but remember a doctor is just a person with extensive knowledge about the body even psychiatrist don't know everything about the brain and it's correlation with the body. with that said how can they be definitive with any mental diagnosis and there causes and symptoms.",schizophrenia

1531,"That's kind of hard to answer as most of the young people that I have worked with over the years (and seen in the hospitals) that had ""schizophrenia"" as children really had other disorders. It's pretty rare for a child under the age of 13 to have true psychosis or schizophrenia. When that happens, providers tend to look for a more neurological reason for it such as CDD, or other neurological impairments.
I do however remember a pair that struck me. I worked with a pair of brothers that started to get the beginning symptoms in their mid teens. The first thing was their thinking and logic was very disordered. Their behavior began to get very bizarre as well. Where as one brother was out of control and dancing on tables, the other was rather passive, but said things as if there was no filter on his thinking. Just very bizarre things. I remember feeling terrible for the mother because she was always going to hospitals to see her sons, and they were very very sick. But they started having internal stimuli, responding to it, bizarre and disordered thinking, bizarre behavior, and intense mood swings.
That's about all i can remember.",schizophrenia
1532,"Going anonymous on this one for obvious reasons, also because my illness isn’t public knowledge yet except to family and close friends (I am one year out)
Well, the psychotic break is very clearly defined in schizophrenia… usually when the person acts completely irrationally or out of character. If lucky law enforcement is not involved. For example I read about one lady on Quora who was an executive assistant for a CEO. She started scheduling meetings and a huge get together between her and her CEO and all the other CEOs in the area to talk about something. Eventually she got fired. It wasn’t until after when things got much worse that she got diagnosed with schizophrenia.
However, prodromal symptoms exist for a long time before. It could be any of the following for the “paranoid” type of schizophrenia
Extreme paranoia, paranoia of being followed, of being watched
Taking elaborate precautions to avoid surveillance like taking different routes home etc.
Thinking people are coming after you, thinking people are out to get you
Thinking people are talking about you, laughing at you, etc.
When it is happening, it all seems normal to the person
Eventually all the prodromal symptoms result in a “psychotic break” and the person basically loses touch with reality.
What’s worse is that people with this illness usually have poor social skills. I have what could be called an “asshole face”. I usually make a big effort to be polite especially to servers or minimum wage people and I leave a relatively large tip. But sometimes you just have either a bad day or you forget. A lady just put 4 sugars instead of 2 creams into my tea. I am going to be up until 3 AM because of that. I don’t know if I was rude to her or not — I said thank you etc., but people with schizophrenia have to rebuild their social skills from basically nothing. Rebuilding social skills is one of the steps to recovery but they will never be able to pickup social cues as well as someone who isn’t schizophrenic. This leads to people treating schizos poorly, and schizos withdrawing from everyone.
To everyone who now feels guilty for treating schizos badly… don’t… I am not a believer in environmental factors. It’s a chemical imbalance in the brain, plain and simple, and no matter how badly you treated a schizo (and didn’t know at the time) you didn’t cause their schizophrenia, don’t worry. You don’t have to be extra nice to a schizo, just be yourself.
So in other words, poor social skills of schizophrenics makes them be treated even worse, which feeds into their paranoia making things even worse for them. Not their illness, but their supports, and perhaps their life. One of the main symptoms of schizophrenia is stopping paying attention to your personal appearance, and most people judge you by your look to start. Schizos slowly start losing touch with reality, stop cutting their nails, cutting their hair. To most people this is being “lazy” but for a schizo it just doesn’t make sense or is too much effort (called adhedonia).
There is a reason why a lot of them stare at the wall all day drooling and it isn’t the meds.
If you were lucky enough to be “intervened” in the meanwhile, before the psychotic break and to be on meds, your chances of recovery go up. If you aren’t lucky enough, or if your family or friends don’t notice and you have your break, you need to be hospitalized. After the hospitalization, everything changes. You have to adjust to a new way of thinking. You have to talk to yourself and learn coping mechanisms. You have to rebuild your social skills (which were poor to start) from nothing.
A lot don’t make it out. They just take meds and drool and stare at the wall for the rest of their lives, accomplishing nothing. It’s called adhedonia. You can spend years doing absolutely nothing, because the concept of goals or achievement, simply don’t matter to you anymore. In fact, doing nothing, is how you cope with the illness. Voices and or delusions telling you to do X or Y? There is no such thing as telling, if it is “real” or not. That doesn’t work, because you cannot tell reality from fantasy. The only coping mechanism is to sit and do nothing at all. Schizos have a high chance of walking into traffic, causing accidents, etc.
Plus, there’s suicide risk. 1 in 10 people with this illness commit suicide. The more you had to start before the “psychotic break” the higher the chance. For example, if you are male and high achieving and highly successful and get this illness, there’s a very high chance of suicide.
So what happens when it “starts”? There’s no fine line, usually prodromal symptoms have existed for months or years before the “break”. If they have. It’s a poor prognosis. I am fairly lucky I have several coping mechanisms, including a rather sarcastic personality and I have had kind and understanding people most of my life. But take away the social safety net (if I told you what I got, almost by accident, most would be incredibly jealous) take away the people put me in a few more bad situations, and my life would be ruined.
A few may have schizoeffective disorder … just a single psychotic break then no symptoms after and come off their meds a year or two later, but that’s a minority. In general it is life altering, life shattering, and most of all you can feel very very alone. It is devastating in a way few people understand or know in many ways. And it is under-diagnosed and under appreciated… for example I have read that many would rather have cancer than this illness. At least with cancer you get social acceptance. Well, I don’t particularly give a fuck about social acceptance (and many other things) the only thing I care about are my rational and critical thinking skills. Which are 1/10th where they could be, if I didn’t have this illness. I can probably build up my intellect later, but in a capitalist society intellect doesn’t guarantee financial success or even a job. Main thing is depending on others will probably fuck me, I will have to create my own path in life where I am in 100% control so that if I have a bad day or a bad hour or a bad minute I don’t lose everything.
Piecing together my life a bit at a time, probably thinking of CBT next definitely have to take action because the current status quo isn’t working.
Source: Schizophrenic, currently off my meds (I should be on meds, I will decide based on my symptoms) and working a nice high paying job. I intend to write a book about my experiences and monetize it. I have what is called “awareness” I know that I am sick. Many schizos are not as lucky as I am. The “paranoid” type of schizo, seems to leave mental reasoning and faculties intact. I still have my radio detection device, my brass helmet (to guard against radio waves etc.) and other countermeasures. At the time it all made perfect sense. How am I dealing with it? Well I have a schizo friend who says there is no upside to it, everything is terrible. I disagree. If and when I choose to make my illness public, I will have the ultimate excuse. And I have an excuse to be lazy, to not shower, to not cut my nails. It’s fucking great. I am taking ownership of my schizo, and will probably publish a book about it. By the way, delusions of grandeur is another symptom of schizophrenia.
Take care and good luck… one of the main ways people “recover” from schizophrenia is to help others. Problem is not everyone is the helping type, and not everyone needs help. I will see who I can help in this life, but first I have to look after myself. And make the most out of the time I have, because life expectancy of a schizo is 15 years less.",schizophrenia
1533,"Childhood schizophrenia (also known as “early-onset” schizophrenia) is a severe mental disorder that can affect children as young as five years old. While it shares many of the same symptoms as adult schizophrenia, there are some signs and behaviors which may indicate the presence of this disorder even in young children.
The primary symptom of childhood schizophrenia is a wide range of unusual thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. A child with this disorder will have difficulty understanding reality and may experience hallucinations or delusions – false beliefs they hold despite evidence to disprove them – which appear “bizarre” from an outside perspective. They may also exhibit symptoms such as agitation and fearfulness, trouble staying focused on tasks or conversations, compulsive behavior, extreme mood swings with no apparent emotional trigger, abnormal speech patterns such as speaking too quickly or too slowly for their age level, illogical reactions to events or people around them, strange movements or postures such as rocking back-and-forth rhythmically for no apparent reason. It's also possible they may show less interest in activities they once enjoyed and be withdrawn from social situations altogether.
Early diagnosis and treatment are essential when it comes to managing the effects of childhood schizophrenia throughout one's life; not only can it improve quality of life for the individual affected but it can reduce long-term severity of psychotic symptoms later on in adulthood if treated timely by dedicated professionals trained in mental health care. Psychotherapy sessions targeting impaired thinking processes providing evidence-based therapeutic interventions along with appropriate medication management strategies should be considered to assist individuals suffering from early onset psychosis leading them towards healthy adult lives living satisfying personal lives free from disability due to persistence illness caused by psychological disturbances during their formative years.",schizophrenia
1534,"Schizophrenia symptoms in children are the same as schizophrenia in adults with the following differences (in general):
Children who have schizophrenia may have less lethargy, indifference(the so-called ‘negative symptoms’ of schizophrenia) than adults have with schizophrenia.
Children who have schizophrenia tend to have childlike hallucinations and delusions. As an example, where as an adult may have delusions about the IRS following them, children tend to have delusions about cartoon characters following them.
Children who have schizophrenia may have overall more severe schizophrenia than adults have with schizophrenia. About 65% of adults have ‘mild or moderate’ schizophrenia according to one older study. My guess is that about 75% of children with schizophrenia have more severe schizophrenia.
Children with schizophrenia may have more visual hallucinations than adults who have schizophrenia. The ‘may’ is there because adults may be reluctant to report having visual hallucinations.
More children who have schizophrenia may have other disorders such as Intellectual Disability, Autism or other disorders(my friend’s son had childhood onset schizophrenia, autism and Intellectual Disability). These other disorders seem to worsen schizophrenia symptoms markedly.
There is a small group of continuously nonverbal children for whom it may be difficult to confirm that they are having hallucinations or delusions. These children may not have any way to describe their symptoms to anyone.
The reasons parents bring their children to a psychiatrist for childhood schizophrenia tend to be that the child cannot sleep through the night, that is a very common reason for bringing the child to the family physician and then a psychiatrist when the child has schizophrenia. Read Sheila Cantor’s excellent book Childhood Schizophrenia to see very-well-done surveys of what symptoms are present in children with schizophrenia that first cause parents to bring them to the doctor.
Childhood schizophrenia is not as common as adult onset schizophrenia.
Adult onset schizophrenia occurs in about 1% of the population. Childhood schizophrenia supposedly occurs in about .0001% of the population.
A special case is where people have a brief bout of schizophrenia symptoms in early childhood, then have no obvious symptoms until adult onset at the usual age (18–21 for men, slightly older for women). Most of my friends with severe schizophrenia describe obvious symptoms for at least a short period of time during childhood, but they did not have more persistent symptoms until they reached adulthood and were only diagnosed as adults.
And of course when an individual has severe Autism, Intellectual Disability and Schizophrenia, they may not be able to communicate about their schizophrenia symptoms. So such diagnoses may be missed.",schizophrenia

The timing of schizophrenia can actually make the condition even worse as around this time people begin to move away from home, whether to college or to the work force, surrounding themselves with people they are new to. Because of this, and the fact that many cases have came with no prior mental illness, people do not know the sufferer is acting abnormal, and since this is such a rare disease (less than 1% of the population), most do not know what to look for or expect someone to have it.",schizophrenia

My family and church had some weird ideas about me to begin with, but I took what they said and ran. I discovered that God, angels and demons could talk to me. They were trying to teach me a new language based more on conceptual thinking.
Along with that, I had bad negative symptoms. No energy, isolating,never wanting to do anything, no interest in anything, flat affect, out of place emotions, and I was a complete slob.

1541,"I can only answer this from the point of view of a mother of a son who has schizophrenia. I first noticed a deep, dark depression, worse than any depression he’d ever had. He withdrew from everything and everyone, wouldn’t answer phone, texts or emails. Then he lost his girlfriend and job. His girlfriend told me she thought maybe he was manic or something. He routinely posted gibberish on facebook, phrases that didn’t make any sense and often with made-up words. Next, his roommates kicked him out because he couldn’t pay his rent. I brought him home and that’s when he went completely psychotic. He told me his thoughts got blocked, that he was hearing voices and his behavior had just become totally erratic. He would get lost when he left the house. He became unable to function in the real world. He agreed to go to the ER and he’s been in therapy/on meds ever since. He exhibited most, if not all of the classic symptoms of the disorder.",schizophrenia
1542,"Everyone has different symptoms when first developing schizophrenia, so my symptoms might be completely different than someone with the same diagnosis. However, I will still state what happened to me.
For the first time in my life, I was tired. I was 14 years old. Before this, I could wake up for school and stay awake. I wasn’t quite a morning person, but I had no trouble staying awake after getting out of bed. This suddenly changed. I would be in class, and my eyes would start rolling in the back of my head without me even closing my eyes. I’d have microsleeps all day despite getting a full night of sleep. It felt terrible. I was constantly exhausted no matter how many hours of sleep I got the night before.
My feelings toward my family suddenly changed. I felt that they were against me in some way, I’d constantly argue with them. I was always on edge around them, I was afraid they would hurt me. This fear lead to me hating them for a bit, sadly.
I developed very odd rituals. If I did not throw ice cubes into my pool, I would die. Every time I went onto my back patio, ice had to be thrown into the pool.
I loved being alone during this time. I looked forward to being home alone, but once I was actually home alone, I still felt as though there were people there. I’d walk around the house asking who was there. I looked for cameras, as I thought my parents were trying to catch me doing something I was not supposed to do. I would look up at the ceiling and say things like, “I know you’re there.” “Stop recording me, I know what you’re doing”, ect.
I had what I called my “emotion breaks”, which were little voices that would pop into my head. If they said something mean, I’d think it was my anger trying to talk to me. If they said something happy, I’d think it was my happiness trying to talk to me. I believed that my emotions had come to life in my brain, and they were talking to me.
I had very odd moments of confusion. I would be doing my normal thing, like homework, and suddenly, my brain would shift. I would very suddenly believe something very strange. For example, one time I thought that there were secret tunnels in my house that lead to the mall, I thought I had to find them to get to the mall. I would get up and look for them, wandering around my house, then I would think myself out of it. I would start having rational thoughts, like “Have I ever seen the inside of these tunnels before?” “Wouldn’t I know where the entrance was?” “I thought I got to the mall by car” Then I would realize, after a few minutes, there really aren’t any tunnels.",schizophrenia
1543,"Schizophrenia is rarely diagnosed in children.
Even if a child does have it, it would be rare for him/her to have any insight about it. They cannot tell if it is normal or not. So diagnosis is difficult.
However, it does not mean that the children have a worse prognosis. As is the case with every other mental illness, the prognosis is different from person to person, be it a child or not.
I am 21 now.
I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about a year and a half ago. I've had all the symptoms that I exhibit, right from around when I was 12 (or that is as long as I can remember). In spite of being diagnosed so many years later, although my condition has become quite concerning now, I still am not like the others who have had a worse experience with it (or with psychosis).
Generally, the voices don't affect me as I've learned to live with them for such a long time. Also, I haven't responded well (or at all) to all the anti-psychotics tried on me - most of the available molecules have been tried, but to no avail. So, until the time comes when something may help be better, I need to handle them on my own (I'm being taught to do this since recently, after the medications weren't of much use). However, my delusions are much more concerning, since I am, as of now, unable to differentiate between a delusion and reality. I'm having cognitive problems as well, but these started about three years ago.
Still, I'm very much functional, and I'm happy about it. This was my case of Schizophrenia, it would be good to know what it was for the others. I hope this was helpful.",schizophrenia
1544,"Having parents or other close relatives with schizophrenia, bipolar, intellectual disability, autism, or severe persistent depression. That is what increases the risk of childhood schizophrenia.
Some of the gene locations involved can be involved in several different disorders. Some of the gene locations are specific to schizophrenia.
Schizophrenia is about ‘misspellings’ at more than one gene location. That’s why it doesn’t inherit in an orderly, simple fashion like those little punnet squares you learned in grade school.
Those gene locations spell out ‘recipes’ for specific substances the brain needs to develop. All the gene locations involved in schizophrenia are involved in helping nerve cells in the brain develop before birth. Nourish brain cells, direct them on their migration, help them hook up with other brain cells. And stuff like that.
What we call schizophrenia is actually a set of cognitive challenges that come about because of these ‘misspellings’ at specific gene locations.
In some cases, the same gene locations are involved in schizophrenia and autism. The ‘misspelling’ at that gene location would be one misspelling for schizophrenia, and a different misspelling for autism. The misspelling for autism tends to be ‘letters left out,’ and for schizophrenia, ‘letters scrambled.’
So the two disorders are genetically related, but completely distinct from each other. And note how different the effect can be, even when the same gene location is involved. Spelling is everything.
Too, schizophrenia is not just one gene location, it’s a pattern of misspellings at MULTIPLE gene locations.
NO ONE GENE location is ‘the most important.’ No one gene ‘causes’ schizophrenia. What matters is how the multiple gene location misspellings ADD UP. They have a ‘cumulative effect’ greater than what they can do by themselves.
I think there’s about a half a dozen slightly different patterns of multiple misspellings at multiple genes in schizophrenia. And I think we’ve found eight or more slightly different patterns of misspellings for autism.
All these patterns are STILL in a bunch of the many, many gene locations that govern that very complex process of brain growth before birth. There are several dozen ‘really bigtime’ gene locations found over and over, and the total of gene locations involved is around 100 - or 200, depending on how picky your criteria is.
Schizophrenia is genetic and often is inherited.
When it occurs in children, there are specific gene locations that are misspelled that cause schizophrenia to surface earlier in life than it usually does. Usually, schizophrenia becomes obvious during one of the last few big spurts of brain change and rewiring - the one that occurs right before adulthood.
But you know, there are OTHER stages of life where a big spurt of brain change (rewiring) occurs. Schizophrenia could become obvious at those times in life as well.
About 1 1/2, 5, 8 or so, young teen years, and latter teen years. These are times when the brain is rewired.
Schizophrenia starts causing obvious symptoms at the ages at which big spurts of brain change and ‘rewiring’ occur. WHEN it starts is ‘programmed’ by those mispellings in the gene locations.
It is not due to how the child is raised, fed or treated. It is not due to trauma or mistreatment.
There are many neurological signs of schizophrenia(about 75 total, often referred to as ‘soft signs’), both in children and adults. But I believe that there are often more neurological signs in children with schizophrenia.
Children with schizophrenia often have trouble with muscle tone and balance. The classic book ‘Childhood Schizophrenia’(Sheila Cantor) notes that the children with schizophrenia tend to dislike riding any toys or rides that swing back or move backward. And she notes how children with schizophrenia will often lean against you, both for reassurance and cuddles, and to support their balance.
Children with schizophrenia often have very good posture and muscle tone before the symptoms start. But right before onset of symptoms, they often will suddenly slouch and develop lordosis. It’s quite astounding to see. Cantor also covers this in her book.
In fact, over 90% of children with schizophrenia are born with very low muscle tone(‘hypotonia’ - again, see Sheila’s book). Hypotonia occurs with other disorders, so seeing hypotonia in a newborn doesn’t prove they will get childhood schizophrenia. It’s usually in looking back that parents realize….’hey, she had hypotonia when she was born. I wonder…was that an early indication?’
Some of them will also have ‘hemi-neglect’ - use one side of their body less. Reach for toys from a very, very young age with just one hand. Even crawl in circles or more in one direction than another, as one side is stronger than the other.
Back to hypotonia(something additional I want to mention). At birth, their little legs lay out sideways and muscle tone is so low the whole outside of the leg may lay right on the surface they’re laying on when they’re lying on their backs.
A number of moms have told me they thought it was quite odd, the way their newborns would lay on a surface with their knees out.
The symptoms that most people think of when they think of schizophrenia, are the delusions and hallucinations. In children with schizophrenia, delusions are usually ‘childish.’ Not about aliens or the government conspiracy, but about cats. Birds. Numbers and letters. Cartoon characters. The puppy down the street. Usually.
With childhood schizophrenia, many practitioners have commented over the years again and again that children with schizophrenia have more visual hallucinations than adults with schizophrenia do.
I’ve noticed that. I’m not sure that it is a childhood schizophrenia vs adult schizophrenia thing. Children may be more willing to talk about visual hallucinations than adults, or children may have severe symptoms more often than adults do.
One thing to keep in mind is that SOME children have a mixture of schizophrenia symptoms and autism symptoms. Sometimes, if the child is nonverbal and very severely affected from very early in life, even experts cannot say for sure if this small subgroup has autism or schizophrenia, or both. We are getting better at this, but in a tiny handful of children this remains a serious diagnostic challenge.
Keep in mind that many children with severe intellectual disability and/or autism have psychotic symptoms. Some docs won’t call those symptoms ‘schizophrenia’ because these kids don’t typically have the lethargy and alogia adults so often get with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia’s so called ‘negative symptoms’ (‘negative’ because they are ‘things taken away.’ These symptoms are very disabling, but they’re not called ‘negative’ because they’re bad or disabling, but because they are ‘things taken away.’ Similarly, ‘positive symptoms’ are so called because they are ‘things added’ - like hallucinations and delusions).
With the redefinition of Schizophrenia as ‘Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder,’ that requirement (that children with autism and psychosis must have negative symptoms TOO, to get the schizophrenia diagnosis) may gradually fade away.
One thing to keep in mind. ‘Genetic’ and ‘inherited’ are not exactly the same thing.
Sometimes schizophrenia occurs without a person having any close ancestors with it. As noted that could be because of other closely related conditions close ancestors DO have, that also confer a risk of schizophrenia, or the genetic changes could pop up on their own. Probably you’d refer to that as a ‘mutation.’
Some gene locations are more vulnerable to misspellings as they get a lot of stress on them as genes unzip and zip back up to be copied, to make new cells.
Researchers are wondering if they could prevent some of the biggest, worst misspellings with chromium supplementation, but they don’t know yet if it will help.
Even if it were to help, EVEN JUST A LITTLE, TAKING MUCH MORE THAN NEEDED WOULD NOT HELP PREVENT ANYTHING AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS(YOU CAN TAKE TOO MUCH OF CERTAIN VITAMINS OR MINERALS AND CAUSE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS).
SO DO NOT OVERDOSE YOURSELF WITH CHROMIUM SUPPLEMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT CHILDHOOD SCHIZOPHRENIA. PLEASE. TAKE ONLY RECOMMENDED AMOUNTS. PLEASE!
Chromium, at least in very preliminary tests, appears to make DNA just a little tiny bit more limber. Maybe it could prevent some of the gene misspellings, which are, fundamentally, about DNA getting busted.
We don’t know yet, it will require much more very careful research.
In other words, schizophrenia is genetic, and is often inherited.
Finally, a word of hope to parents. Children with childhood schizophrenia can face some tough, stormy years, so can their families. But if you can hang in there, grit your teeth and stick with the treatment, and reassure and comfort your child in every way you can, there is hope.
Early on, medication doesn’t always seem to get at all the symptoms. Their medication needs may change rapidly, both for which medicine and how much, as they grow so rapidly.
Further, doctors might recommend Clozaril, and parents might recoil, remembering how in the past, people were often highly sedated by huge doses of Clozaril. But things have improved. Docs are prescribing lower doses of Clozaril, yet still getting good results.
And docs are recommending lower doses of antipsychotic medication in general. Both for adults, and adjusted for kids.
Since many side effects are dose related, much research was done on exactly how much is needed and at what dose side effects start creeping up. The goal has been to get treatment of the illness without the side effecs.
However, it’s also now recognized that some people have an enzyme that breaks down these medications. In the past many medication failures were because this was not known. Now, doses are adjusted for that situation.
In other words, some people who actually need more medication. They get it, and those who don’t, do not get the old high doses. They don’t wind up getting as severe or as many, side effects on these newer lower doses.
If your child is prescribed for Childhood Schizophrenia, remember, much of the point of medication is not short term, but very long term, preventing the illness from worsening.
The only way it can have this overall effect is if they get it every day, as prescribed. Don’t withdraw medication or drop the dose, because ‘he’s been having a pretty good week’ or ‘we’re going on vacation.’ Or…’I think it’s going away!’
Stick with it. Every day. It’s not just for symptoms that are happening right now. It’s also for the future.
As much as possible, give your child the fun things in life. A trip to the zoo. A picnic. Therapeutic riding. Art classes. Whatever you can squeeze in. Whatever he enjoys.
I know it’s hard.
I’ve seen what parents go through. This is no picnic. If you need to talk, feel free to give me a shout.
Just remember this.
This is not your fault.
You didn’t do anything wrong.
It’s no one’s fault.
No, I am not going to tell you ‘God won’t give you more than you can handle.’ God gives people more than they can handle all the time.
But hang in there. You’ve got friends. People who understand. People who care.
Lots of love, Susan",schizophrenia
1545,"I have been living with schizophrenia for some time and know very well that being prepared may help, but professional help is the best way.
The first two years, I had following symptoms:
Panic attacks
Disturbed sleep
Sleeping during the day and staying awake during the night
Mood swings
Hearing voices inside my head
Heightened sense of morality
No interest in cleanliness
Thinking i'm more important than I was
Withdrawn and moody at the workplace - tendency to vanish in the background and under performance
No interest in socializing
Being diagnosed with the disease helped me immensely, at least I knew what was wrong with me. I was glad that my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. In the long run, I have dissociated from psychiatric treatment and embraced symptomatic control techniques like meditation and deep breathing.",schizophrenia
1546,"First, I was just answering my thoughts with my own thought, meaning I had an active conversation with myself; it seems normal at first. Then, strangely, I hear the radio or TV seem to be talking about me (or at least I suspected it was about me). This seemed to just go away at first, with 2–3 week intervals, and then it became a week, and then just days apart. I was actively having a discourse in my head. Well, it must have made me think that I was on to something different that just a handful of people on Earth have, so I kept this to myself. This made it difficult to turn back at this point. I guess it’s just the way it works. Our brains trick us into believing something that just isn't “normal”.
There were also times early on when people I didn’t know really did seem to know me; I mean, I hear them talk about me, which I just brushed off. Strangely though, they seem to know what's going on in my head. One time a mad man cursed me in the street, saying that I should stop what I’m doing or we're all gonna die! Just crazy you know, so this got me deeper and deeper into my insanity.
Sometimes when I looked at people their faces seemed bent, and so I just ignored all of these. In the early stages, I think the best thing to do is to have a healthy conversation with a “real” friend, and to visit a psychiatrist.",schizophrenia
1547,"So, it isn’t typical to find active schizophrenia in kids. However the sooner a disease is caught, the better the chances are for helping the disease. The same is true for schizophrenia. The active phase of schizophrenia usually has an onset during the late teens to early 20s. There is also the Prodromal phase though. This happens before the onset of the active phase, and can even last several years before any of the active symptoms. The Prodromal phase doesn’t have many noticeable symptoms. During this phase, a person may become withdrawn and/or more anxious. It can be difficult to tell the difference from other disorders such as anxiety or depression in this stage. A good indicator could be if there is any schizophrenia that runs in the family. It is a very genetic disorder. So, if a kid is displaying these Prodromal symptoms and there is a history of schizophrenia in the family, it may be a good idea to consult a therapist. Even if it is just anxiety or depression, therapy could be useful.",schizophrenia

7,"Hey guys, I wanted to share something from my experience. Before having my psychotic episodes I've always watched videos of how to kill the ego, how to gain ego death. I was a stoner at the time and watched terence mckenna videos. It was all good. I always hated my selfishness. I always wanted to kill the ego. I always thought the ego death would be a blissfull experience. But no, it's not. When I had my first episode and I completely lost my self awareness. I was tied up and send to hospital. I experienced a the ego death. I did not want anything. I don't know if I wanted anything. It was horrific. And during my second episode, this time voices came, I thought I was having a demon like Naruto. And also thought I might get powerful like Naruto with kurama. But the demon in me is worse than Sukuna. Sukuna is kinder compared to my demon. (And also mine  is powerless..bastard..good for nothing lol) the voices were actually tricking me making me believe that others were saying some words which was what I was thinking. As I was losing my ego, I came to the understanding that this isn't right. And I said fuck it, if everyone wanted to kill me , they could have done it already. I don't even have bullet vest if so called fbi was following me to kill me. So I said fuckk off to my delusions. And this ego which I holded on to, was the only thing that saved me from harm. Do not kill your ego. It is the only thing that stops the demon inside. And also anime demons may help, but not real life demons of schizophrenics so do not trust it.",schizophrenia

12,"When you hear voices and hallucinations for 10+ years, you get pretty used to it. But when I tell people what I hear, they freak out. So this is the analogy I use to calm them down.

Imagine you live near train tracks. At first, every train that passes is startling and disruptive. The noise demands your attention, maybe even makes you jump. But over time, something interesting happens - you develop what residents call 'train brain.' The trains don't stop passing, but your relationship with their noise fundamentally changes.

You learn to recognize the rumble without focusing on it. You can carry on conversations, work, or sleep while trains pass. It's not that you've stopped hearing them - they're still just as loud - but you've developed the ability to acknowledge their presence without letting them interrupt your life.

Sometimes, you might even find yourself unconsciously pausing in conversation when a train approaches, automatically resuming once it passes, without losing your train of thought. The noise becomes part of your environmental baseline rather than a disruption.

What's fascinating is that visitors to your home might be startled by these same trains, maybe even worried about how you can live with such noise. But to you, it's just part of your daily soundtrack - neither good nor bad, just present",schizophrenia

I take medication everyday and experience negative and positive symptoms VERY regularly. But everytime I’m doing relatively well, I start to think to myself that maybe I’m not really ill and there’s a part of me that tells me to stop taking my meds because I don’t really need them. I know this is objectively false- that I’m not ill, that I don’t have schizophrenia. I know I do. The problem is that everytime there’s an ounce of stability in my life I start to doubt myself and doctors despite 20+ years of symptoms and terrifying experiences. I don’t know how to curb these thoughts. Because I experience thoughts that I’m actually okay and not experiencing an illness/disorder, when I do have a full on episode (which isn’t as frequent these days as it once was) I immediately become extremely emotional and disoriented. It terrifies me because at that point, I’ve convinced myself nothing is wrong and that really all those terrifying experiences and hallucinations were just what? My imagination?

And after he harassed me and I reported him he started trying to guess my triggers and purposefully make an episode occur. 
This lesson taught me one thing, never open up with strangers or people you don’t really know. Even little details like your diagnosis can be used against you. If you hear a trigger In Person just nod and politely excuse yourself and say you need to go to the bathroom. If it keeps happening remove yourself from the situation all together.

49,"**TLDR: Girlfriend has 3 male relatives (brother, mother’s 2 cousins, + possible other disorder in maternal uncle) with schizophrenia. We are concerned about the risk for our future children having it, + her own risk of developing it in the future. We are seeking someone like a genetic counselor, who can help us assess the risks + options for prevention & worst-case treatment. Our provider’s genetic counselor was not very helpful, our provider’s psychiatry department only treats actual patients, so we do not know where to go next to answer our questions.**



Hello all,

I'm not sure what the most appropriate subreddit is so apologies if this is not well-suited here, and I sincerely hope this post does not come across offensive in any way. My goal in this post is to find out what the appropriate medical expert is for getting support in making this decision, and I'm hoping users here may know the right places to get these kinds of questions answered.

The abridged background for this is that we are 5 years into this relationship and are planning to make things official, but this (the hereditary risk of schizophrenia) has become a bigger challenge than we originally foresaw. We both want to have children, but I am not sure I am comfortable under the circumstances, whereas my partner understandably is not willing to sacrifice having biological children unless the risk is very high. I think we can reconcile if either I am able to become more comfortable with a high risk (perhaps from better understanding treatment and prevention options + typical prognosis for cases), or if I find I am over-estimating the risk. 

Therefore, we want to talk with someone who understands the development risks & treatment options well, who would be able to have an in-depth conversation about us answering our questions and hopefully offering guidance about the situation. 

**Questions we’d like to ask counselor:**

1. Chances of our kids developing condition, based on known family history
2. Chances of grandkids developing (if we get lucky, are we just passing on this dilemma to our own kids?)
3. Preventative measures - what can we do to reduce chances of our children developing it, and how effective is it?
4. Treatment options - worst-case, how well-treated is the condition today provided it is caught early? IE how likely could the child live a normal life.
5. Any genetic tests? (I think I know the answer - no, tells us very little)
6. Help developing an early screening/treatment plan for partner & her healthy brother 

We already saw one genetic counselor through my partner’s provider, but the appointment did not feel very helpful. The counselor was nice but seemed out of his depth in this particular topic, no specialization in psychiatric conditions and such. He could not help us with discussing preventive and treatment measures. He did give us a risk assessment, but this seemed like basically the same as the basic risk charts we ourselves can find online: he said 3% chance per kid, based on my partner’s brother, and that partner’s mother’s cousins having it did not substantially increase the risk because they are distant. I would very much like to believe this, but I am skeptical that it could be so low because it seems like there is a clear trend present in the family that is beyond what just her brother having it indicates.

So essentially, we want a second opinion regarding the risk + someone who can discuss the treatment/preventative options, but we are not sure where to go considering we already tried genetic counseling, and the psychiatric department said they only do therapy for actual patients. We are in the Bay Area. Should we be looking for a genetic counselor with speciality in this topic, or some other expert? Is this a wrong department issue, or is the expert/counselor of the kind we're looking something that is not present within every medical system? Does anyone have any similar experiences? Any referrals/leads/advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I know it’s something I dont understand what’s really happening but it’s been really hard for me to handle my own mental health , as being in a joint family and having big business empire I have lots of work stress, family opinions and also have to work with my wife on her mood swings. Today I have been diagnosed with migraine due constant stressing of work, wife and family . I am trying very hard but at the end I get blamed from everyone, my family which is orthodox does not understand this illness and blame me for spoiling my wife, my wife with her illness isn’t in a right place to think any better of me. I didn’t go to college coz I had to get into business early so I don’t really have friends, all my school friends are either out of city/country for career. I don’t have anyone to share.

69,"**VENT & THE REASONS BEHIND MY QUESTIONS**

For the last three to four days I've experienced hallucinations in the form of a voice that comments on everything I do and tries to control my actions while being condescending towards me. In addition, I'm having a hard time with the negative symptoms. I've spent the last days sleeping and I haven't eaten properly, since I lack the drive to do so. What bothers me in this situation is that I am fully medicated on neuroleptics, and despite that I still have these periods of time where I am feeling ""numb"", for the lack of a better word. It's hard to describe the sensation, because a part of me don't feel depressed, anxious or even sad. While another part of me feels as if what I am doing is utterly pointless. I've counted the days when I am somewhat functional, meaning that I am able to take care of myself, my living space, and follow through with important appointments and keeping in touch with significant people in my life. The longest streak I've had is about twenty-two days, and afterwards I fall into a state of ""feeling numb"" and/or having hallucinations for about four days to two weeks. These periods of feeling off - being dysfunctional, used to range for about three weeks to two months and the more functional state used to last for a couple of days..! With that said, I know I'm very slowly, but gradually, improving. However, it's such a vicious cycle and it feels incredibly discouraging to know that this'll be my struggle for the rest of my life.

**QUESTIONS**

What I am wondering is if anyone is or has experienced anything similar in their lives? And if so, how do/did you improve so your ""functional streak"" lasts longer? And/or how do you better manage, comes to terms with the days - where your illness becomes an obstacle?

He’s a very popular and active in his school student and told us because he wants help.

We took him to a Psychiatric & Mental Health Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) and was given a diagnosis of depression with psychotic features after an hour evaluation. He prescribed an SSRI for the depression and is getting us in weekly to see progress and if an anti-psychotic is necessary.

My son has been interested in drawing and horror themes for some time so this “diamond” seems like a scary thing to me. This monstrous entity. He’s said it doesn’t like some people at times. The provider when I asked if we were safe, said since he hasn’t acted on anything that we should be fine. Still it’s just unsettling.

81,"I don't need to work because I get enough from SSI/food stamps to pay rent, food, transportation, entertainment, etc. and still save some at the end of the month, because my mom shares the cost of the rent, utilities, and phones/Internet.

But when she dies, I won't be able to afford to support myself and darn sure do NOT want to live with my sister. I probably can't now because she has a boyfriend who she might marry. I've been looking into affordable housing but that's still in the works and my mom is resistant, hoping her get rich quick scheme allows us to buy a condo instead. I can't move into housing alone now because my mom needs my help and we're super close.

Plus I have tens of thousands of dollars in student loans to pay off. They're in forebearnce now but I'll need to pay it off eventually.

So I've been looking for work.

But I can't function around people for extended periods of time, like hours a day, everyday, for years. I start feeling a loss of control, start hearing more voices, and become miserable and depressed. I've lost several jobs after there was a staff meeting or a mandatory party, because every time there was, I'd call out sick for two days in a row to recuperate. I don't want that to happen again.

I feel very uncomfortable interacting due to past trauma (verbal and psychological abuse) and the voices, which seem realistic. I have trouble saying no and establishing firm boundaries. I fear that someone will dominate my will and ruin my life. I fear that people will turn me into a normie, a mainstream, typical person (Christian, married with kids, etc) just to make me as miserable as they are because my current happiness is a slap in the face to all the hard work they put into pursuing happiness. I see people as predatorial so I stay away. I only leave my room if I have to. All my friends and my bf are online relationships.

So the obvious solution is to look for remote work.

But even though I'm working with a job coach who helped me write three different resumes, cover letters, references, thank you note for interview, sales pitch, interview questions to ask, did a mock interview, and we applied to 90 jobs, I still haven't gotten hired.

My sister said competition for remote work is very stiff because everyone wants to work at home. So it might be unrealistic.

I took many meds while I was there (there are many schizophrenic people in prison) and the one that was the most helpful for me was olanzapine. I loved it at first. It helped with my anxiety, hearing voices, sleep etc. I didn’t gain much weight like a lot of people do and overall it was very helpful. One major side effect I noticed was that it totally tanked my sex drive. I didn’t mind at the time because I wasn’t trying to have sex while I was in there anyway and it was sort of a relief not to have to masturbate (you have very little privacy in prison, masturbation is always a process so that you don’t disrespect the people you live around). I stayed on it for a year and was as happy as an incarcerated schizo affected guy can be… as my release date got closer though I decided to get off of it because I was excited to finally be able to have sex again, and didn’t want to have the diminished drive when I got home. I quit taking my meds a year before my release and I’ve been home for a little over a month now and my sex drive never returned. It’s embarrassing. I have to make myself think of sex and even then it’s a major undertaking. I was looking for some advice on ways to get my sex drive back to normal levels for a 36 year old man. Before taking olanzapine it was an everyday thing, now I would never think about it at all.

117,"It’s been a week since I found out my mom has schizophrenia. My uncle had it too, but I didn’t understand what he was going through at the time. He died by suicide in 2021, and only now, after seeing my mom like this, do I truly understand what schizophrenia is.

She hears voices, sees faces in objects, and believes there are cameras watching her in the house and at the store where she works. She thinks she’s being tracked through GPS and keeps telling me we need to move because we’re being watched. Every day, she asks me if I hear the voices too. Some of the voices tell her horrible things, even to hurt someone.

The last time she saw a psychiatrist was in October, but my dad never told me. He took her, but I had no idea. If she had been taking her medication since then, wouldn’t she have improved? But she wasn’t taking it. Now, I’m monitoring everything, making sure she takes her meds because I know antipsychotics can help stop the voices. Therapy could also be good for her if we can manage it.

Since finding out, I’ve been researching nonstop—watching videos, movies, and testimonies to understand as much as I can. I know now how the voices sound, what it’s like to see things that aren’t there. I understand that when she’s having a psychotic episode, it’s not really her—it’s the illness. That’s why I’m trying my best to be patient and supportive. We never leave her alone because we know how serious this is.

The problem is, I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s all I can focus on. My mind is consumed by it 24/7. I just want to do what’s best for her, but at the same time, I feel overwhelmed.

My perspective has completely changed. Before, I saw my life as the center of everything, because it is natural for us to see the world from ourselves.

119,"Hi. Ok here’s my story. 
I was a horny teen and my parents didn’t like it so they took me to an exorcism when I was 19. Ever since then I’ve had pretty massive issues. I hallucinate getting tortured by demons pretty regurally if I misbehave religiously (think kiss a guy or girl). The torture is horrendous. I feel things that aren’t there on my back. They can give me massive headaches, make me incapable of walking, violently shake, slur my speech. All kinds of nonsense. I sometimes experience “lite” versions of this with no cause. But if I have sex, really bad versions of this can happen. 
I used to be normal. Could fuck and be fine. But now, just bc some lady told me when my brain was developing “if you have sex outside of marriage, demons will torture you”. Really messed up stuff. I’m now 30 and incapable of having a sexual or romantic relationship. Is this schitzophrenia? I need help. It’s been 11 years and I don’t know what to do. Other wierd things that can happen is that I can pick up their energy. So like say they had depressive disorder and I fuck them, I can “pick up their disorder” for months. I KNOW IT SOUNDS INSANE.

My sister went into psychosis 9 months ago. It was her second psychosis. She has no diagnosis yet, but I know that psychosis is a symptom and not a disease. Her first psychosis was exactly 4 years ago and she stopped medication after 1 year.

During her second psychosis I had to cut contact for about 6 months, since I was part of her psychosis. She feels better now, apologized to me. However, she suddenly has a relationship to her toxic Ex which is hopefully gonna end soon since she somehow seems to slowly realize everything. 

However, I can’t talk to her properly. Like as if I can not build up a deep conversation. She has this emotional numbness. Is there a chance that she is gonna be normal again?

124,"So for the last 4 years I've been in and out of the ward, cycling through tons of ap's. I've been doing pretty okay on Zyprexa, Trazodone and Effexor, but out of nowhere she put me on Risperidone and Zoloft and im worried that the new meds are making things worse. She said she was worried about ""extra pyramidal symptoms"" whatever that is, and that risperidone should help more with my sleep.

Since she switched my meds up I've been hearing things more than usual, voices echoing from outside my head. They bully me all the time and tell me to do things. Im starting to have more visual hallucinations too, like Shadow people and other things. It's been getting to the point where I can barely sleep and its preventing me from eating too.

My family keeps trying to tell me that these things aren't real and that they're just hallucinations, but I'm starting to not trust them. My paranoia has been getting worse, like no matter where I go I feel like I'm being watched, like people are following me. And lately I've been starting to think that my family members aren't themselves, like they've been replaced or something. Sometimes I feel like the tv is only talking to me, and the other day I thought my therapist was going to hurt me because she used a blue pen instead of a black one. 

I can't afford to go back to the ward, but my psychiatrist won't listen to me. I asked to be put back on the old regimen but she said I have to wait until I reach the theraputic dose. The problem is, I've been on those meds before but they didn't work. I don't know what else to do.

131,"He really needs meds but unfortunately missed the cutoff for open enrollment last night. Going another year without treatment would be a potentially life-altering disaster for him. He has had bad experiences getting treated in the past (put in a facility involuntarily, refused the meds he was given) and it took me a long time even persuading him to seek treatment, so he will need a sure hand. He is largely estranged from his family and I seem to be the only one helping him with this (from the opposite coast, doing what I can). Frankly I am also looking for a reliable doctor to help guide him back to reality, which I can’t do alone. 

Any thoughts on what some options could be? What comes to mind are:

1. There is a free psychiatric clinic in LA (where he lives) but the reviews are atrocious. Given his bad experiences with medical treatment in the past I am reluctant to jeopardize progress with a crummy clinic. 

2. Looks like Covered California has a “special enrollment” period with certain criteria. Is this pretty restrictive or is it easy to get into? 

3. Medi-cal also seems to be an option—not sure if he meets income cutoff though and smaller selection of doctors. 

4. Paying out of pocket is technically an option, though seems prohibitively expensive. 

5. Is there any other way to acquire affordable insurance/care outside of the open enrollment period?

.
.
.

im sorry if i seem overbearing sometimes. i just want my loved ones to know they did well or they worked hard. i want to remind them that. because i know growing up i didn't hear that very often. or maybe i did but always felt undeserving. but the difference is i always feel undeserving of love, of tolerance of my intolerance, of my childishness, of my extremeties with empathy and how easy i cry and get overwhelmed. people have been so supportive of me even as i constantly feel undeserving of it. i don't have much to my name so it's understandable why i always question when someone offers bare minimum kindness to me. because when i look in the mirror i see someone that's meant to be alone. not meant and not deserving to feel the warmth of quiet intimacy and tender kindness of persevering love despite much proof that people will love me regardless. because when i look down i see blood soaked hands. tainted and ugly. theyre not anyone else's blood. they're mine. it's the blood of all my failed past selves and future could've been identities. this invisible blood reminds me of all the possibilities where things went differently for me. in a good way. but now here i stand in this space of a room where i am safe from the shame that fills me when i leave it. i am ready and filled with eulogies to read at wakes. most of them are mine. most addressed to the parasitic leech ive found myself becoming in this universe. eulogies for myself. 

i feel i am undeserving of anything. but i know i deserve love. just as many do. i am scared people will eventually see myself the way i see myself. that is with deep shame and contempt.

so i suppose that's why i want to remind people they are loved. despite feeling not enough. feeling too much. feeling too little. i want them to understand that i will accept them regardless of how little they feel of themselves. in this space between you and me - i'd always like to remind you that you are allowed to feel. you are allowed to be sad. i will hold you. or i will not. we can sit in this space in silence or with whatever music you'd like. you will be safe here. you will be loved. you can rest here. take off your shoes and place whatever burdens and concerns you have by the doorstep. you are fine here. for now. and with much hope, you will be for tomorrow . and the days after. and after.



many people think blind optimism and believing goodness for the sake of goodness is a terrible thing. that choosing to stay, choosing to stay alive for what others might assume to be trivial matters. for preferring a life of solitude with no aim or ambition. for the sole purpose of living and feeling. to savour this fleeting moment of today and to remind yourself you are surrounded by the beauty that is life. who is it to dictate what you feel? how strongly? how you love? the reason you keep pushing through to wake up the next day? people will always say things. bad or good. 
it is everyone's first time living. no one makes all the right choices. there will of course be better choices. and sometimes in retrospect in the future you'd look back and think ""if only i had done so and so.."" 
to mull about the choices of the past and the possibilites is what pllagues and burdens even the best of us. but that is inevitable isn't it? you can't change what's already done..and for the future..even if you planned everything..it won't always turn out the the way you predict it will. what you do have however is today. so do what makes you happy. it is everyone's first time living and it is the only life you have. so live. live despite all the ugliness in the world. 

Thank you :)

The poets name is John Clare, he wrote this in 1847  he was known to have suffered bouts of depression and mania, and hallucinations plagued him. He never felt like he belonged when in society, he often preferred solitude and walked in nature rambling to himself with a notebook he would write in. 
In 1837 he was taken to an asylum in 
Essex England, where he wrote this. 

“ I am

I am — yet what I am none cares or knows;
My friends forsake me like a memory lost:
I am the self consumer of my woes —
They rise and vanish in oblivion’s host,
Like shadows in love-frenzied stifled throes—
And yet I am and live — like vapours tossed
Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,
Into the living sea of waking dreams
Where there is neither sense of life or joys
But the vast shipwreck of my life’s esteem’s;
Even the dearest that I love the best 
Are strange — nay, rather, stranger than the rest. 


I long for scenes where man hath never trod,
A place where woman never smiled or wept,
There to abide with my Creator, God,
And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept, 
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie,
The grass below — above the vaulted sky. “

157,"So yeah, I've always been a fucked kid, did terrible in school, few friends (good friends, but few) and no luck with women, i've hated myself from the day I hit puberty because ""You don't deserve a girlfriend""

In my 20's I got my heart shattered when one of my closest friends started dating my HS crush (who was the most amazing woman my sick mind thinks I've ever met) and said ""Hey man, I think I can be the guy who gets her V-Card"" I was furious and started sliding into her DM's to try to make a move, since he's better than me, because I'm shit, he won, she flat out said ""I know what your goal is and I don't appreciate it"" they broke up like a moth later and I was told by another friend he didn't do it.

So now I'm miserable, this girl got me to get in the best shape of my life, I actually beat him in an arm wrestling contest (like THAT means anything) and I'm taller than him, (I'm short so, when your short losing to a shorter guy is FUCKED city)

Anyway, I grew bitter, and hated myself, and said, fuck it, next girl I get a chance with I don't give a fuck, I HAVE to fuck a woman. I met a girl at an anime con, played cards against humanity (When it was first coming out and it was a hot new thing) and I got her number, I was over the fucking moon. I went on 3 dates with this girl, and on the second date she invited me into her room, I thought ""Holy shit, Im gonna get laid!"" and we were playing video games, having a good time, and I offered a back massage (Thought I was so fucking smooth) and while I rubbed her back I unhooked her bra, I went for boob and shes like ""No"" and I'm like, fuck, it was awkward, when I left I went in for a kiss and she dodged it. On 3rd date I get invited to the room again and she shows me this special bed for her sister, shes paralyzed from the neck down so needs amenities when she's here. She tells me this story about how her cousin pushed said he wanted to do a skateboard trick and asked his dad to move his car out of the way and then pushed her in front of it. I was horrified. And earlier in this date, I saw a family photo and thought ""huh, one of the guys in this picture looks like my uncle""

Anyway a few months later, I have a complete mental breakdown while my parents are on vacation and I'm home alone, I remembered that I killed one girl, who I gave brain damage to in a game of duck duck goose in kindergarten, they made me spend time with her and have to take care of her and it was to much so at her birthday when they did a pinata i killed her by beating her senseless with the stick, and paralyzed her sister because their father would hit me so I hit her in retaliation not knowing what I was doing. I also would punch pregnant women in the stomach because, IDFK why, its just something I did. And when I did it around the age of 12 my male family members all got together and beat the shit out of me, including my cousin who was 16 at the time. I couldn't come to my parents about this so I texted him asking if I could talk. he didn't respond and I told him ""I'm so sorry, you did what you had to, I didn't give you a choice"" and then my dad from the beach calls up and says ""Cousin X told Aunt X and said you were saying some weird stuff, whats going on??"" And i just blurted out (And I was smoking a ton of weed at this time, was a habitual user while all this was happening) ""The girls! I remembered the girls! The girls that I killed!"" they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. Its like, it all came flooding back, As a child I was a monster, killing and maiming other kids, punching pregnant women and making them miscarry, I was so distraught, I realized I was a monster.

Those girls father, was my uncle, children from a previous marriage as him and my mother's sister never had children together.

All the memories came flooding, of all the times when he was alone with me he would abuse me, and when I was older and had repressed all these memories him, and my other uncle, father's sister's husband, would give me a gut check every time I passed a life milsestone, I remember when i graduated my mom says Uncle X wants to say something to you, handing me the phone and he said ""She never got to graduate highschool"" I didn't know what he meant and he said, ""You know what the fuck I mean""

And then other memories, about how everything that went wrong in my life, HE was behind it, my life is shit, I have nothing, I'm miserable, and part of me...its all his fault, he's been working behind the scenes making sure that I will NEVER be happy....

My dad took me to a doctor, I'm medicated, I'm doing good, Im in a better place but I'm still miserable, does this sound like something that could be Schizophrenia? Could it be true, could there REALLY be a giant conspiracy against me? I mean, I know one of the hallmarks is you think theres a giant conspiracy against you, but this seems plausable enough to think that yeah, the only way my life can be this bad is if someone is fucking with it. These memories became so vivid, like it all clicked

The first time I got my heart broken, he was there to say ""She never got to fall in love"" and whammed me,

When I didn't get to fuck that girl I thought was into me, he was there to say ""She never got to get laid""

And I have this one memory where he told me, ""I'm going to ruin your life, some day, you're going to meet a great girl, and shes going to want to marry you, and right there, when you're at the altar, I'm going to be there and crush all of this""

160,"I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia for about 4 months now, and I'm curious what other people's experience is like with audible hallucinations. I'll start by sharing mine.

  
I was getting bulled at work for a while, and in the beginning the voices would mimic what I was experiencing on a nearly daily basis. They sounded like my bullies and at first I thought nothing of it. Over time, I realized that I was struggling with a pretty obvious and scary mental health issue and the voices began to change and just generally be mean-spirited and negative. Finding any excuse to pick on me and try to make me feel bad. There was a moment where they almost felt like their personality solidified as well. In the beginning it seemed like they didn't really have a concrete identity if that makes sense. 

Once I got medication, the voices stopped being so negative and bullying and started being more positive and goofy. While they are still generally stressful and negative, they act more like an annoying younger sibling who's constantly judging me and poking fun at me. It feels more light-hearted, and there have genuinely been times where I enjoy talking with them and ""spending time with them"" so to speak. I've actually cried over the fact that they aren't real because I was having a nice time with them.

  
On top of all this, the voices have, without prompting from me, declared themselves to be my siblings and have even given themselves names that I never assigned to them.

  
This whole experience has honestly just been wild and I'm still surprised most days by the fact that I'm even dealing with this, it just feels so surreal.

170,"I've been on here once before to share, and I wanted to see if anyone else has this. I'm diagnosed schizoaffective, and I'm on medication that mostly controls my delusions and hallucinations, but I'm running into something. When I'm laying in bed, not sleeping or dozing, but just laying around, I will hallucinate hearing voices. Sometimes it's whispering, sometimes it sounds like I'm in a crowded store and there's a bunch of voices all around, and other times I'll hear music. I can't tell what they are saying, but it sounds just like a person is in my room, talking. I asked a family friend who is a therapist, and she says it is my schizoaffective disorder breaking through the meds. But then I did research and found this thing called Hypnagogic hallucinations. I guess I just wanted to hear from anyone else if they have trouble distinguishing the two? If these are part of my schizoaffective disorder, then I've been hearing voices since I was in high school...

171,"My mum has been a paranoid schizophrenic since she was 24. She’s 58 now. Growing up, she was constantly in and out of hospitals, having breakdowns, and my dad (who is still with her) was often angry and aggressive. Their relationship was full of fighting.

Now, me and my sisters have all moved out. My older sister has kids but had to block my mum after she started sending strange messages asking if the kids had been abused. She’s also been sending odd texts to me and my other sister.

I recently visited home, and my mum unloaded everything on me—she feels lonely, stuck, and says she hates living with my dad because he controls everything. The only joy she gets is from seeing her grandkids, but my sister won’t allow it, she can’t afford the train, and my dad won’t drive her. She says she wants a job, but my dad won’t let her because they’re both on benefits (him as her carer, her on disability).

I tried suggesting hobbies, local activities, even a mental health group and church she’s already involved in, but she had an excuse for everything—everyone hates her, they’ll judge her, they’ll be racist, etc. I didn’t know what to say or believe. It just left me feeling hopeless.

She was saying things implying she’s ill etc the priest in church jealous of my sister being married with kids, saying (lots of different) people hate her and say to her she is sh*t and nothing, that people tell her they prefer my dad and do not like her, that my cousin, who lives on the other side of the world and is very young, is trying to get married to my dad, that my dad is cheating on her etc. 

She’s on strong meds and gets injections every two weeks, but she seems to be getting worse. This has happened before—she gets sectioned, they adjust her meds, she improves for a while, then it declines again, and the cycle repeats.

178,"My first interest in the tailbone was 13 years ago. I asked google if it wags and google said yes. I took no interest in it after that for 6 years, but was very interested in a dizzyness I suffered in relation to schizophrenic symptoms for 6 years. Then one day I was watching baseball and started thinking about the tailbone and how the batter was wagging the bat and his waist at the same time. I then realized that my own tailbone could make me dizzy. For 4 years after this I continued to struggle with the tailbone being the only cause in relation to my schizo symptoms. Then I wrote a paper 3 years ago that the points of that paper haven’t really been changed or added to since and I have gone those three years with very minor schizo symptoms. My main point from the paper is when the balance system is wobbling from the tailbone OR on its own, both of which can cause hallucination, objects in your vision that attract attention begin to wobble. Your vestibular can be controlled and the wobbling moved between objects by thinking a question like what is in that cup? Moving the wobbling voluntarily helps as needed at first to dissolve hallucinations from carrying on. The key cause to wobbling in the tailbone, which can manifest as wobbling in your vision, your musculoskeletal system, your balance system alone,  nervous twitches, is going to be high adrenaline, usually from breathing changes induced by a hyper attentive state. 



high adrenaline from footsteps at night, you either hallucinate what it is or write it off and fall asleep. The same thing happens with high adrenaline but the fight response when you are awake with the fan on and its screaming high adrenaline. Clever thing is when you feel your adrenaline spike watch your tailbone, if it wags fiercely the adrenaline has spiked, but if its slow to move then you can catch the adrenaline while its low and avoid it getting worse through breathing and squinting. Next time you feel you are getting angry or high adrenaline notice how this is prime time to hallucinate. That fight response brings to mind opinion, beliefs, judgement, and ideas, is probably why its often that people suffer government hallucinations.



The tailbone also wags when: you swing a bat(or pretend to), when you walk or run, standing in line at a restaurant, while thinking of what to write, hallucinating, luscivious thoughts (which can be angering esp hallucination), music, interest(sometimes solely in itself wagging).

179,"Altenaitve therapy to one of the most common themes of hallucinations, science.

here is my most recent attempt to explain the universe. First off the aether. I believe in the aether because of Femto camera experiment that proves it. The aether is analogous to a sheet of graph paper. All phenomena and everything that exists can be represented on this grid. The grid of the local universe is stable presumably from gravity fields of distant super nuclei that keep the grid at a constant. The graph represents temperature, where smaller grid pattern is hotter, and wider grid pattern is cold. The balloon atom has a magnetic field that comes from its core, no electron, everything can be represented by the temperature grid of the aether. In the core of the earth the balloon atoms are side by side and dense to the point that there radiating properties convert to insulation properties. So gravity is an effect of the core having 100% insulation until it reaches a temperature where it starts to radiate as a whole, then regains its insulation properties etc.. This puts a wave in the field. When the earth's gravity field passes through the aether's, it's the same effect as an energy wave passing by the earth, and heat is produced in the core from movement through the universe alone. The core acting as one also spins the whole planet as partial radiation of the heat of movement and the sun's heat. When heat passes around the balloon atom, it retracts the magnetic/gravity field back into the core of the balloon atom, but because heat is in wave form, a temperature gradients is created and the balloon atom finds equilibrium with the wave by spinning into and out of its way. Spin is essential to creating the magnetic field impression on the gravity field. North and south are universal because of the attraction of likewise spin say in molecular chains, vs counter wise spin which would cause a repulsion. The balloon shape to the atom comes from the core of the nuclei, which are like tiny planets, attract toward a new center during fusion, change shape and surface area pressure, and release heat. Fusion is like welding where as gravity and magnetic bonds in molecule's are much weaker.",schizophrenia

And then one day fear ran through me and I was never alone again. 

What really gets me down isn't so much the struggle of life with this illness but all the things it robbed me of. All those opportunities passed me by and while others get a, ""you can do it if you work hard"", I get a silent understanding that stress will break me

I'm a female, soon to be 37, is having mild to no symptoms daily. But I know I'm not completely back to normal but like 99% recovered for sure. I do get fatigue faster since I got these symptoms even with medication but being able to function for 10h before I need to crash in bed is still considered a huge win for me.

207,"Someone had asked in this forum or a related one (I can't find it now haha) whether paranoia about people disliking you or talking about you and that sort of thing is typical of the disorder.  It was heavily endorsed as definitely being a common aspect by people responding.

I feel I need to preface my question with this disclaimer:  I am ***not*** questioning the validity of people's experiences or their diagnosis.  Not at all!  I am merely trying to understand the messaging out there as it compares to what I have been told over the years by clinicians.  I also feel it is important to note that I don't necessarily believe in the concept of ""personality disorders"" as they exist today.  

Now, onto the question:  **I was always told that paranoia in disorders on the Schizophrenia spectrum related to more bizarre circumstances, and if the paranoia was more focused on people in your everyday life and their feelings and thoughts towards you, it was indicative of the paranoia in personality disorders?**

My paranoia has always been more in the bizarre realm when I have experienced it.  Like if it was people I knew in my everyday life, I thought they were conspiring with the government or with some higher power to watch me, or take notes on me, or to see if I would be able to figure out the experiments they were running or something along those lines.  This actually went away for many years so I have no idea if it was related to psychosis or not, but I did bring it up with a team of mental health doctors when they asked if I felt anxious around people or thought they talked about me, and I replied in the affirmative.  They never asked the context, and there were a lot of queries around personality disorders because they assumed it was more about like whether I thought people liked me or not.  

Anyways, eventually a clinician did ask more questions about those experiences (years too late haha), and I provided the extra context, and this clinician said that this was important information because paranoia in personality disorders generally revolves around the direct interpersonal, where as paranoia in psychosis is more big picture like organizations, systems, governments, etc. out to get you, or some other kind of bizarre scenario.  Basically the paranoia in psychosis is pretty obviously insane to everyone, but the paranoia in personality disorders is possible (even if it isn't probably).  

  
**Was this clinician out to lunch and just sharing their own theories, or is there something to this in the literature?  And if you have experienced more of the interpersonal paranoia versus the more bizarre, how did clinicians still identify the root cause was the schizophrenia?**

I havent taken these things Ive been nearing very seriously because I didnt think it was considered hearing things. I dont hear them like someone out here. I described them to a friend as in the same ""realm"" as my own thoughts, but they were loud, obsessive, and not my own voice. It- concerned me greatly. So...I have quite a few questions about this all. 

1. How do you know its voices and not your own thoughts? I hear my voice in my head, but then theres the others that Im here about. Ive come to call one reoccuring voice Malachai, but he says its a dumb name. He is very critical of everything I do. He pushes my intrusive thoughts to reality. He knows my deepest insecurities and at night, when I try to sleep, he mocks me for my selfishness and desires. Its hard to distinguish him from the other less vivid people I hear sometimes though. Bringing me to my next question.

2. How can you distinguish memories from voices? Can voices be memories? Another reoccuring thing is Ill hear things like my father angrily screaming my name, a moment in a song playing on repeat indirectly criticizing me, or they will be memory like voices of when a relative or friend has told me someone was using me, even though that person was not. They always approach it differently, but never respond. When they do I find Malachai's voice warping in over theirs, almost using them against me. See what I mean when I say its hard to distinguish them? It has driven me to genuinely believe I am a victim and has made me lose too many good people in my life.

3. Are they worse when you're alone/in a quiet place? I find whatever this is to be worse when Im alone, unless Im panicking over something. Then its as if a hundred voices are talking to me at once telling what not to do and what will make others upset. Its a mix of the previously mentioned Malachai criticizing my actions, the memory voices of similar things in the instance, and then it just feels like theyre swirling all around me and Im left frozen in place.

4. Have you ever lost control of your actions? I called it ""autopilot"" at first. (TRIGGER WARNING, mentions of suicide and self harm. I wish I could use two flairs but cant). The worst time was when they were all saying things along the lines of no one wanted me. They told me to hurt myself and somewhere in it all I gave up and let them tell me where to go. I dont remember choosing to get up. I wound up coming to my senses just before it was too late and I wound up in a hospital. That was the most dramatic of the times its happened, but others Ill just be so lost in the words that I just start moving like a puppet. Im thinking its mostly just impulsivity mixed with being exhausted from everything else, but its worth asking about. Ive been told this is similar to disassociation, but ""autopilot"" sounds less definitive to me.

I got a lot goin on right now and just want to sleep in peace again. I cant do anything anymore without it being so loud and so quiet at the same time.",schizophrenia
219,"Not asking for medical advice, but does anyone take this medication every two months or monthly. My doctor has me prescribed to take this every two months but on the box it says 1 month dosing. I’ve been stable for awhile now with no episodes but since starting this a few months back I’m starting to have auditory hallucinations again with stress exacerbating the voices and making them get louder. I told my doctor about this and she just increased my dosage. The pharmacist ( probably just a technician ) seemed kinda annoyed with my concern and just told me basically this is what the doctor prescribed based on my symptoms. That the manufacturer doesn’t make the dosage my doctor recommended for my symptoms so this should suffice for two months. I’m about to give myself the injection now and was just wondering if anyone else is prescribed the same protocol? It seems a little strange to me to be under medicated pretty much. Maybe because I was on such a low dose prior to this and I’ve had success with injectable’s before. 

Just want to see if others are using Uzedy monthly or bi-monthly. It seems confusing that my CVS sheet says inject once every two months yet the Uzedy box says 1 month dosing. 

I know most users aren’t injecting themselves. My doctor knew I had medical training.

Anyone on other injectable’s that are longer than one month or two months? How’s that working for you?

221,"I went through psychosis which I believe to be drug induced, i was taking buttloads of THC-P which is 33 times as strong as normal thc. But at my current rehab place they think I'm schizoaffective.  

I still have some paranoia and delusions despite being on 4 MG a day of rispiderone (sucks). I only heard a few auditory hallucinations which were whispers of my name in the two months it's been since getting clean. Now I'm like obsessing about if I'm hallucinating. But I have BPD so some of the stress related transient paranoia can be attributed to it.

My parents are paying for me to be here and don't want me to be diagnosed schizoANYTHING and are helping me to get an addictionologist that I can see. I'm so grateful to them. Two months ago i called the cops on them after I thought they were trying to kill me.  

May i ask, does a schizophrenia diagnosis follow you around in that the diagnosis can be seen by everybody? Like how has a diagnosis affected your job opportunities, etc..  

I've always been somewhat anxious. How does one differentiate extreme anxiety from paranoia? I can definitely feel my rispiderone wearing off toward the end of the day and I get more anxious and kinda just tense.  

I'm stuck because my mom doesn't want me to be diagnosed but I may or may not truly need the APs. And the APs themself make me look like I'm experiencing negative symptoms from schizo with how tired they make me.  

The nurse practitioner here just went with whatever the psych ward put me on and is upping the dosages cause I'm still anxious but I can't differentiate between anxiety and paranoia. My ""paranoia"" is like thinking mundane actions by my roommates are malevolent acts. And there are times when I'm not affected by it at all.  

But I can't ignore the fact that I've heard some whispers in the past few weeks, despite being clean for almost 80 days. I'm sorry for rambling, but I levitametrly don't feel like I can trust anyone. Perhaps I can only trust my parents but I don't want to let them down. ",schizophrenia

231,"When me and this wonderful person where in middle school we where not only emo trash but also shared a peculiar bond. We where magically special and connected to other planes of existence. 

When we became closer to each other as 7th graders, we noticed over time that we both seemed to have a extra ""sense"". I would often be staring to make out the strange figure that wasn't quiet there. Focusing on seemingly blank spaces and reacting to its movements. She would often ask if I was talking to her. Or be looking over her shoulders. Definitely Had a similar sort of staring at nothing thing going on.

In our separate life's we had a secret to ourselves and from eachother. In my saga I had specific aura like beings that hung around me and never spoke. Weird  partials in the air that moved together. only slightly distinct to the atmosphere. Creating a from of a bipeadal being. They would get near me or just hang around in groups or single. Sometimes extending a weird moving air bits of arms towards me. In her situation it  was more of a shadowy being who would communicate. And change forms. Taunt, heckle and also befriend. He was a stronger character in her world. Sometimes friends with a talkative ghost group coming and going as they pleased. 

Us noticing the odd familiar reactions we had to things. We confided to each other of our odd experiences, sight and connections to these creatures. And the similarities in the situation where enough for us to believe we had a spooky special connection to another plane of sorts. Made doubley exaggerated by our little goth/emo hearts. It really was a cherry to our aesthetics.

We through ourselves in to a off and on paranoid excursions of delving in the devil. Not really, but witch craft and pagenism was our homework. We would have nights of even putting ourselves in states fear because of what we would see. Girly sleepover vibes.  Feeding into each others state. Solidifying the beliefs we had and giving us powers and psychic energy. 

We parted ways due to boy drama in highschool and also harder personal home lives. We stayed in touch after graduation but only really here and there. Never truly bringing back our power duo.

My unknowing schizo-effictive bipolar disorder morphed and made it's self more known and apparent as I grew into my early twenties. My delusions took on new forms and figures. All though to the ogs still visit me. Sometimes, And they still have nothing to say. Many hospital trips and bouts of psychosis (paired with the loss my childlike  wonder) I no longer feel like a special witch bitch. Just a patient trying to be patient. 

I reached out recently, now us both 27 years old.  And out right asked about what to make of this. Telling them about how I have a mental disorder (not writting off their understanding. They could still be magic.) just wondering what that experience had extrapolated into for them. And tada. The shadow figure from youth is more of a roommate in their life. Never left. But other visions. And paranoid thoughts and voices have come and gone in many different forms. In a working diagnosis stage with doctors but all the symptoms point to the schizo effective scale. 

We discussed our delusions. Laughing at the similarities in frame and uniquness in meaning. I had been convinced many a time people where talking to me through my vents. And hiding in my house. Either as crack heads or a duo who wanted to hurt me.  Where as they where also being spoken to through the vents. It was paired with the being recorded and followed. And the full belief someone was trying to plant drugs in their home. 

In a way. The real magic to me is the rarity of that shared thing. The probability is so random. To come to eachother as psychics and grow up into psychotic. Just a joke. But I'm kind of glad I had that. It feels like the best way I as a kid could have probably interpreted that. We both had negligent parents. And therapy was for crazy people. That's the rederic they spouted to us. We reviled in the devil. Even when we where scared at least we had eachother. And superpowers duh. ",schizophrenia

233,"Hi all,

My mom has been showing signs of schizophrenia and I wanted to know if there were any anecdotal guidance around how best to approach her about it?

She turns 51 this year, cognitively she is operating and functioning well but she does a few things that really, a normal person doesn’t do. For example: she confided into us yesterday that when she’s alone she hears voices. She thinks it’s god telling her that he loves her. This obsession with god has just been I’d say within the past 2 or 3 years - and then also she had mentioned that she can feel people’s energies, whether if they’re a bad person or not and that can actually really ruin her mood. She needs to cleanse herself everyday (with sage) and sometimes she’ll NEED to do that in order to get her back to her normal self.

She calls herself an empath and she cries out of no where at times and doesn’t know why she isn’t crying so she thinks that the reason she cries is because of the fact that someone is feeling upset near her. 

I don’t know how to break it to her that she should probably see a doctor about her situation. I am thinking about sending a note to her doctor personally myself to ask her about these instances. 

I know for a fact that she doesn’t talk about mental health with anyone. My culture in itself is very quiet when it comes to mental health and I hate that part about it. I would rather have her have the discussion now before it gets worse. I want to approach this without us getting into a fight and telling her that she’s crazy.

Any anecdotal tips?",schizophrenia

238,"Tldr seeking advice on helping  family member (late 50s) with diagnosed schizophrenia, living alone with elderly mother, never held a job for a significant length of time and living in isolation from other family members. 

I have an uncle (dad's brother) in his late 50s that I see only a few times a year. I have always thought of him as that weird uncle, unable to keep a job and talking to himself. For as long as I can remember, he hears voices and tells us nonsense (usually about jesus). The problem is I come from a family where mental illness is not ""believed"" as a real thing, and his immediate family (my parents) dismisses it as ""he's just useless and crazy"", and they pretend he doesn't exist. I grew up thinking he's some idiot, and I don't believe he has ever had proper familial support. 

As far as I know he has been seeing a doctor for depression and getting meds, but I'm not sure how regularly he is taking the meds. Now he only lives with his elderly mother. I don't think my family take his diagnosis seriously, and just ignore his existence. 

Which is why I only recently found out about his schizo diagnosis since nobody talks about it and I didn't know better. I want to help, but I don't know how since it's been so many years of isolation and pretending that he doesn't have a real problem. Maybe even just to spend time with him and let him feel that he's not alone in this world, and that somebody cares. I admit, even I thought he was full of crap until I found out about his diagnosis. His health has deteriorated in recent years, with kidney, heart, bladder and other issues. Maybe this is my way of repentence. we have failed him as a family, left my grandma who wouldn't give up on her son alone to take care of him, and I am so sorry.

I want to help, but I also have a wife and young child who aren't comfortable with him around so moving in with us is out of the qn. I'm planning to visit once a week or so, and maybe spend some time calling or texting him regularly. But I'm not sure how else i can help.

Not because I don't have compassion for these people who are clearly suffering from a lot of different angles, and not even because I don't have compassion for LWAS despite how angry I am with her for facilitating these personal nightmares based off of what is a downright FANTASY, but instead because, as a lot of people have expressed, I'm just so disappointed in her husband and her care team for letting her go off the deep end and inspiring the masses to further suffering without posing a real challenge to her.

I've just been feeling this congestion of emotions made of anger and sorrow and I just needed to get it out for a second now. I know better than I ever have after my psychotic episode and after getting into community with other psychotic people here, that you cannot control the world and you cannot save everyone.

Edit: I completely understand that not everyone needs meds to manage psychosis, that some people don't even benefit from them because of their treatment resistance, that almost all of us have to deal with negative side effects that can be difficult to even want to deal with even if the medications help, and the many other understandable reasons that makes someone want to go of the medications. That does not make going off your meds a safe thing to advocate for as a schizophrenia influencer, and just because you think you're the exception, that does not actually mean that you are.

Everyone I meet is scared of me. I have absolutely no penchant for violence, but it doesn't matter. Too scary. Too much.

People think I put curses on them, that I cause debt and death wherever I go, and especially that my existence hurts my loved ones. They tell me my case is unique, that I actually spread my Schizophrenia to those around me. I walk into a room of people I want to interact with, and it goes completely silent and I'm met with gawking stares. People stare wherever I go, no matter how I dress. I love everything and everyone so deeply, but it just doesn't matter. It doesn't matter that I walk on the eggshells 24/7, deliberately calculating every movement, every word, lest one small mistake discredit me entirely. It's ""inappropriate"" to talk about how I experience life. It's ""inappropriate"" for me to express myself. It's ""inappropriate"" to exist. I fought for a command over words that I have no ""right"" to use. In my worst delusional panic attacks, I gasp for air I have no ""appropriateness"" to breathe.

I have tried everything, even going so far as to literally pay someone for their friendship. People come into my life, see my desperation for connection, take the money I'm willing to pay for it, and leave. I'm asked, then, well, why did you let it happen? I've been asked that about every negative event that's taken place in my life- and the lives of those around me. Why did you let yourself get abused? Why did you let your family fall apart? Why did you, specifically, do all of this?

Call me weak, but that is not a level of responsibility I can handle alone- especially when people come into my life as strangers, literally expect me to give them hundreds of dollars because they're ""desperate"" for help, and indeed I DO shill out hundreds to help- and then they disappear out of my life completely. I cannot manage this disease and this life alone, and even providers are too afraid of me to work with me. I do not have friends. I have one surviving family member- an aging mother I cling to like a life raft from several states away. I'm often too intense, even for my partner of 5+ years.

People treat my having split egos as a joke. I've had people find out the names of my splits, and call their names, just because they respond theough my body faster than I do, and they would laugh. I've had people treat this disease like it's roleplay, forcing me to further split my egos into unmanageable amounts, to up in the high sixties, to the point where several years are missing from my memory.

I’ve had episodes ever since I was a child where I would be talking to someone and then someone else would be like “who are you even talking to???”. It was always my friends, so I always just thought they were gaslighting me. 

Flash forward and I’m in my late 20’s riding the wave to the top of a career I was really good at and loved. I had a couple of moments where I went in front of 50-60 of my coworkers and thought I was speaking with my manager but I was totally speaking to the air. 

It happened when I walked into the “main room” -I’ll call it, where most of my coworkers work. I was unfortunately tucked back away in a cubicle 99% of the day so these were the only times they got to know me 😣 I remember asking my manager if my boss was in his office and they said he was on vacation and I was like “oh yeah that’s right I saw that email nvm I forgot” and turned around to go back to my cubicle, and as I was walking back, the room went silent, and everyone was staring at me. I was so confused at the time. 

I was diagnosed finally a couple months later because I had my first psychosis. It makes me cringe so bad, it was absolutely the most embarrassing moment of my life. This was also at a very well-known company with high reputation. Idk why but it just now set in that this happened and was why I was being gossiped about so much. I was so confused for the longest time as to why people gave me weird looks and gossiped about me when they never saw me. 🫠 I am such an embarrassment. This is the most embarrassing disorder in the entire world. 🫠 

At least some of them witnessed what happened and were still cool with me?? I’m going to cringe for the rest of my life over this 🫠",schizophrenia

266,"I am 25 and never have been to the dentist (it's a long story); I take care of my mouth very well, but i think i have wisdom teeth starting to bother me.

I am thinking about going around town and asking different practices what sort of accommodations they might have for someone with schizophrenia (and/or, honestly, possibly even lie and ask about accommodations for autism because my schizophrenia label keeps having doctors act like im dangerous). Do you all think this sort of interview idea a good plan? I am an extremely compliant patient, I just uniquely self-soothe, and it tends to unnerve my doctors; i also tend to talk to myself and ""hush"" myself, so idk how that would be in a dentist setting.

267,"Today I caught up with a good friend and at one point mentioned my schizophrenia, just casually. Can't even remember the context but It was light hearted and joking then suddenly his mood lowered and he said sadly, ""if you ever need to talk about it that's cool but I'm so, so sorry that this happened to you"". It was like I'd told him somebody died. It bummed me out and I realised that I cannot casually mention my illness to some friends, without it becoming some big thing. Like, it's a chronic part of my life. Surely I can joke about it without things getting all serious. I used to be able to joke with my friends and now I just kill the vibe and be awkward and embarrass myself. I feel like people treat me differently then before I was sick. And they feel pity for me and feeling grateful that they are not the ones who were sick like me. 

Ontop of all this, I have a seriously have a hard time connecting to others. I just feel that my experience pretty unique amoung my friends and few people ""get"" me. So I feel lonely, often. Even when I'm in company.

269,"So ~6 months ago I heard a voice (I heard someone say “uh-oh” as I was driving past a parked police car) this was the first time I actually heard said voice, thus I shrugged it off as just my mind playing tricks on me. 

Then maybe a month later a friend and I were chillin talking about music and we were trying to remember the name of a specific song and I heard the voice actually tell me the name of the song I was trying to remember as if my brain knew the title and was trying to tell me. I said something along the lines of “oh you’re right tht is the song”. Only for my friend to tell me he didn’t say anything nor had he even managed to remembered the song title himself at tht point. (We were indulging in a little cannabis at the time). I was slightly concerned and my buddy and I came to the conclusion that I should just wait some time to see if it happens again.

So I hadn’t heard it since then until just yesterday where I was in my car parked in the driveway and I heard it started super faint, to the point where I mistook it for maybe some kids playing or a dog barking in the distance. I was also somewhat focused on what I was doing so i didn’t even pay it any mind. Several seconds pass and i hear it again a little louder this time but still not loud enough for me to make out any words or the fact tht it was even a voice. It still sounded like a distant bark or some children playing somewhere up the street. Then some more moments passed and again I heard it and this time it was loud enough for me to make out that it was a voice and it sounded like someone was calling out “yo” to get my attention so I started looking around and just as I thought no one was there. As I’m contemplating what it could’ve been I heard it even louder and clearer this time say “yo” again, and this is when I started feeling concerned.

I did some very base level research and read that just because I’m hearing these things doesnt necessarily point straight to schizophrenia. I guess I just would like to know if anyone has had similar experiences and did it end up being schizophrenia or other factors causing you to hear voices.",schizophrenia

***Are these shapes hallucinations or vision fatigue symptoms?***  


For context, I have been diagnosed, and I do have other hallucinations that are more in the typical range.  I didn't realize those were hallucinations until a couple of months ago when I was asking my psychiatrist why my vision issues improved on antipsychotics and he was like, ""Uh, You don't need to see an eye doctor for that.""

  
I don't know whether what I posted is a hallucination or something I should mention to the eye doctor or perfectly normal.  I don't want to ask my psychiatrist so close to the last time and risk looking like a complete idiot again haha!

 **Indications they Might Be Hallucinations:** 

*  My spouse has no idea what I am talking about
* They go away when I am on antipsychotics

**Indications They Are a Result of Vision Fatigue:**

* They only happen in bright, interior rooms without windows, especially if there are fluorescent lights (but they happen without fluorescent lights, too).

275,"Where do I begin… so my husbands father (we’ll call him John) was taking care of his wife (we’ll call her sally) (husbands step mom) who has Parkinson’s. Things have been deteriorating fast in the last month. Without going into much of the backstory or past, Sally was in a home for about a month and hated it then asked to come back into John’s care. John is a severe alcoholic and has been his whole life. He was not a good father or husband and has always been very abusive in many ways.  He’s been doing a decent job of taking care of Sally but she ended up in the hospital recently because of a fall that broke some of her vertebrae. John started drinking heavily in the two weeks she was there and stopped getting enough rest. We noticed he would call frequently and ramble about all kinds of stuff and we just assumed he was drunk. He started to call later in the evening when normally he goes to bed super early like 4pm. 
Yesterday we got a call from Sally saying John was having hallucinations about people trying to break in and he went as far as getting out a pew pew and having an imaginary stand off with these people. He’s had many many other hallucinations since yesterday and many of them are all of
People messing with him like taunting him, or people trying to break in. He’s hallucinating animals like monkeys in the back yard and dogs or cats in there house. He had a hallucination this morning about a van crashing into a tree in front of his house and the people on the van were abducting a little girl. He actually  called the police who showed up and asked questions then left. Apparently they questioned Sally and asked her if she could take care of herself and she said yes then they left her there. 
I was able to talk to Sally today for about 30 minutes and she told me more about the delusions he’s having including demons and little girls in the house. We tried to explain to Sally that this isn’t going to just stop or go away and that we are afraid he’s paranoid schizophrenic and who knows how long this could last. We tried to tell her she needs to leave the house or call her family who live closer than we do. We are 10 hours away. She’s holding onto hope that he’s going to snap out of it. She’s also very brittle and can’t move much,let alone drive or take care of herself so she cannot leave on her own. 
The reason I’m writing this (there is much much more to the story) is to ask if anyone has dealt with a late stage schizophrenic? Could it be something other than schizophrenia? John will not seek out help and we’re afraid he will shoot him self or anyone who tries to help him or take him to a facility so I don’t think that’s an option either. How can we get Sally out of the house and into an elderly care facility? What kind of documents or information do we need to start gathering as far as the deed to the house or titles to the cars, bank accounts, safe codes, wills etc?? Obviously it’ll be up to us to clean up any mess that is leftover from this so any information I can gather now will be helpful. I’m just not sure where to start planning for what could potentially happen to them and how to make it easier on us. We have 4 kids and like I said live 10 hours away. They live in Fresno CA area if there is any number for facilities or I don’t know… I don’t know what kind of help I’m asking for with this post. I’m just lost at what to do and how to help. John has not been in my husbands life hardly at all and hasn’t been a good person or father so it’s hard for both of us to have to be dealing with this while dealing with our own lives.

Restless all day every day, procyclidine doesn't work and they wouldn't even let me have that because it ""impedes sleep"". Well I couldn't sleep because of the restlessness so what does that tell you??

Literally couldn't ejaculate, I'm 20 years old, what if I want kids in the future?

And to top it all off, I'm a slow metaboliser so I was basically on 600mg.

They basically forced me to take 8mg clonazepam a day then made fun of me when I started enjoying it, all this shit is just bullshit and I'm sick of it.

279,"Hello all. I was diagnosed (confirmed) in the third quarter of 2020. I was seeing a VA appointed Psychiatrist and taking medication for 3 years. Without telling my doctor, I quit taking my meds 2 years into seeing her. I continued to meet with her regularly but stopped midway through this year. I was working 2nd shift and it was very difficult to make appointments so I ceased them. I still have her number in case of emergency and we did talk about being off meds before I stopped my regular appointment. She did think I was fine for the year that I was off meds and she said I could have “acute schizophrenia.” So this tells me it could be episodic. Now it has been quite some time since I’ve had any issues but I have been self medicating with alcohol. I’ve now been sober three weeks and my thoughts are racing a bit. I was driving around tonight listening to music and I had a very imaginative sort of conversation with my ideal woman. I didn’t speak out loud or anything; it was all imagined. But I thought it was so strange that I made note of it. And I find myself rehearsing conversations and scenarios in my head a lot. To the point that I even act out my movements and expressions. I don’t know if these are things associated with my diagnosis or not. But I’m just thinking about whether it could be the beginning stages of an episode.

I have a 0.6 GPA(on a 4.0 scale) I did manage to pass gym class last semester but barely I also managed to pass English somehow(by 1 percent so barely).
It’s not that I can’t do the work it’s that the voices interfere with my ability to do it.
Some days I just feel nearly non functioning in ways.
I have a very hard time understanding things and commonly forget them nearly right away.
I have very bad short term memory but I still remember my childhood before my illness started so I can remember things that happened long ago but remembering things that happened yesterday or hell even a few hours ago at times is a real struggle for me.
I have been hearing voices and having hallucinations since age 14.
I’ve been on meds since that age two I’m currently on invega but I don’t think it’s working very well and it was recently upped in dosage from 3 mg to 4.5 so I need to take 1 3 mg pill and another 1.5 mg pill at the same time bc ig they don’t make a full 4.5 mg one which is annoying bc thats just more pills I need to take.
Now it seems like my coordination is off from it and I’m shaking as well.
The voices are also commonly too loud for me to go to class(especially in the morning) so I just sit in the hallway and don’t go(which is obviously affecting my grades).
Getting me up is a huge struggle as well I either go to sleep and can’t get up or I can’t go to sleep at all and just pass out in the morning.

And in the morning I commonly wake up to voices which obviously makes the situation 1000 times worse.
Which then my parents yell at me to get up and I get aggressive with them.

I feel like such a failure of a kid to them.
They always tell me I’m a POS and they’re done with raising me when this is how I act.
They know I have an illness that is diagnosed but they just reject it and say I’m not actually hearing voices and thats it’s just all “autism”.
 My hygiene is also very bad I rarely shower and take baths and brush my teeth.
I’ve gone up to more than 2 months with no showering or anything.
And I rarely brush my teeth.
And I’m chronically suicidal.
 I’ve attempted multiple times and have been in and out of psychiatric hospitals.
And i still have really bad thoughts of hurting myself and sometimes the voices give me thoughts and plans of hurting others.

288,"hey! tried to keep this short, but i'm sorry it's ramble-y (it's hard for me to organize my thoughts concisely) i tried to write a tl;dr but it was way too long , though i think the last paragraph sums it up okay, and i may reach out in a shorter more accessible post in the sub eventually if that wouldn't be too spam-y. 

i apologize for the text dump - i really don't know how to talk about all of this or who to. the people in my life are all overwhelmed. my relationship with my therapist deteriorated the worse my symptoms got until i had to stop seeing her (she's spiritual and ended up triggering me worse). i'm seeking medical care, but outside of inpatient (not required and also not a safe option in my area) everything is so slow.

i had my first screening with a psychosis outreach program in my state and i'm honestly really scared. which is really weird, because it went incredibly well- the person i talked to was very validating and said they should be able to get back to me by the end of the week. but despite all that, i was so stressed about even making the call, and it didn't go down afterwards - my brain kept spiraling i just got so overwhelmed that i pretty much externally shut down. my girlfriend was able to help, but i still feel very out of it and anxious.

it's hard to even know what i'm scared of- in part because honestly i still feel scared of everything. but i think the biggest thing right now at least is that being vulnerable in general is a lot, and talking about my (potential) psychosis always sets off alarm bells in my brain. i start spiraling so quickly into how if i'm aware, then obviously i'm faking, and then the internal debate starts until i'm convinced i'm just a manipulative malingerer. alongside the instant spiral into ""everyone- especially doctors- thinks i'm lying or doesn't believe me"" - no matter how much they reassure me, the possibility is always there. 

that all tends to get compounded by the fact that i have a really complicated diagnostic profile, and i've had very little luck seeking professional help; i've had medical issues, physical and mental, my whole life, and i had my first big mental health episode when i was 10 or so (i'm 21 now). so i started trying to get help in the next couple years, but my area has really bad healthcare, and for the most part it just caused more stress and a lot of misdiagnosis. i started suspecting i might have psychosis when i was 15 and talked a bit with my therapist at the time about it, but i always felt like a sham, and i doubted it hard enough that i just forgot (my memory is. not great lol) until recently.

my recent episode started around june 2024 (though looking back, the symptoms were building and i had been getting worse since november 2023), but originally i thought i was just having really bad anxiety/ptsd/ocd flare-ups until my speech was very rapid and fairly incoherent and i couldn't hide my odd beliefs anymore. i started suspecting potential schizophrenia due to a lot of my medical history and current symptoms aligning (long story short, a combo of my specific history of psych diagnoses/misdiagnoses, things brought up in my evaluations that got noted as being weird and then just brushed off, and a lot of miscellaneous genetic / medical shit). in particular, i found out what the examination of anomalous self-experience/ease was, and it put into words the chronic dissociation i've felt my entire life but could never explain- trying to just led clinicians to consider me overly dramatic, as i struggle to communicate my symptoms and experiences in a way that makes sense to others outside of weird metaphor, made-up words, and hand gestures.

i don't want to come off like i'm webmd deciding that is my diagnosis of course! i know i can't figure this out on my own, and i also know that schizophrenia isn't the only disorder that can cause psychosis. it's why i'm seeking proper medical help at the moment- i've spent a decade or so just talking about my diagnostic profile with clinicians i've seen only to get ""we don't know, diagnosis doesn't matter"" and i'm so tired of it. i'm scared of never getting an answer. but i'm also so scared of the possibility of being psychotic. in my episode, it literally felt entirely like i wasn't myself - everyone and everything was terrifying and against me to the point it felt that the universe Itself was targeting me specifically. and yet now that it's gone, it just feels like i'm a bad person and need to try harder, some hysterical bitch making everyone around me suffer.

i don't know. it feels like i'm caught in limbo (metaphorically lol, not in the delusional sense). and it's so strange. i've always been a largely logical person, but to me, my strong logic brain and the brainweird unreality parts can coexist - it doesn't matter how logically irrational i know things come off to other people or the fact that i can say it couldn't comply to Logic, but it doesn't make it feel any less real to me. like ""logic"" doesn't truly matter if Anything can possibly happen, and i can't *know* things *won't* happen for sure. especially because most of the symptoms i suspect could be psychotic are very chronic for me, part of my baseline - i don't know how much is just normal for people and how much could be other comorbidities and how much could be a psychotic condition. at this point i don't really care what the answer is, so long as i feel like it will actually help me make some progress medically 

i guess i'm just wondering if anyone is up to talk- about their own experiences with the diagnostic process, about coping with the existential terror of diagnosis and the state of not knowing, etc. especially interested in hearing from other people with weird diagnostic profiles (especially stuff involving other overlapping neurodevelopmental / dissociative shit). i don't mind advice, but i would ask people avoid the instant ""get on medication"" suggestion or the topic of how meds magically helped you- i'm not against them, but i react very strongly and often paradoxically to most medication, so it's unlikely to be relevant to me and it gets extremely isolating to see.",schizophrenia

It all started with lack of sleep, talking to myself incessantly, this was after I was hospitalized for the first time out of four hospitalizations this episode entailed. The first hospitalization was due to erratic behaviors, I drove myself and three children to my hometown after I was told to take a break from work one afternoon due to concerns for my mental health. I was following the voices in my head meticulously of course, as if I was on some sort of divine scavenger hunt that would lead to a grand event. For example, right before I was hospitalized, I had performed a sack cloth and ashes ritual on a Kansas dirt road (right before this I had followed a random truck too closely down a Kansas highway and he pulled over and threatened to call the cops on me), I then drove my vehicle as I was being 'led' to a cathedral I thought was a space ship where I would find my brides, and the remainder of the group of people who would be surviving the apocalypse. I went into the cathedral, it was Sunday and the congregants weee outside wrapping up, I proceeded to lock myself in the cathedral, removed my clothing, and walked through out the entire building. I also licked the marble, and performed a sex act on the alter per the voices leading. I clothed myself and exited to find a man with a revolver ready to shoot me. I put my hands in the air and got on my knees. Police arrived, told me I broke a light, but would not be pressing charges. The 10 day stay in the psychiatric hospital did not stop the episode. I got out unfazed, and the delusions worsened. I thought I was Jesus Christ, and had hundreds of sex brides, the brides of Christ, desperately awaiting to have my body. I also believed God had married me to Lainey Wilson, and ended my current marriage. I told my wife I wanted a divorce and moved to the basement. I then began smoking marijuana, which became a daily and eventually all day occurrence. A few delusions and hallucinations I wanted to highlight:

1. Thinking shape shifters or people with body suits were playing active roles in my life, in other words, famiy members were actually famous people in disguises.
2. Imagining that women wanted to have anal sex with me as a sort of blessing I was bestowing.
3. Believing I had power and control over the population and deciding who gets to live
4. Believing I was the Supreme Being in the flesh, and the ultimate authority over the entire cosmos
5. Complex but completely contrived knowledge about the origins of the universe and the story of creation

What also happened is I sold my perfectly good home, and moved my family to Maine, three kids and my wife. I have destroyed everything, and foresee nothing but worsening consequences. Now I am constantly spoken to by what I believe to be demonic entities predicting my downfall, and telling me all about what I have done, and the wrongs I have committed. I have certain insight into some of my flaws that I did not have before, but this voice does not list these wrongs as helpful insights, and but as reasons I deserve to lose everything and exposed for what I really am. I can't do much, I've had an interview at McDonald's, no call back, I have a second interview at a grocery store this evening. I have destroyed my family and my myself. 

I post this because I need to, and because I find I was looking for posts about symptoms and didn't find many.

Officially I have schizophrenia and PTSD (additional MDD/schizoaffective isn’t off the table yet as I meet the criteria aside from symptom timings, and was told we could talk more about it if it’s possibly more fitting than the current diagnosis).

While schizophrenia isn’t a diagnosis to be “happy” about, I’m glad to finally have answers after waiting for so long. It’s a relief that this wasn’t all in my head. It’s validating to have someone confirm what you’ve known to be true about yourself. I also hope this opens doors for more treatment and support options.

I also wanted to say I’m so thankful to this community for being a supportive space to come to with questions or when I needed advice, and thank you to the mods for continuing to make this place safe for its members.

I thought everyone on the street was watching me. I thought people planned to go to their window just to Watch me. I felt like they all knew something about me

Since then I’ve tried about 3 other antipsychotics and they haven’t worked, not much. I’m considering going back on seroquel but I’m really sad about it. I don’t want to sleep most of my days.

319,"So my boyfriend (26yo) has paranoid schizophrenia. I’ve seen him in his worst moments, even in psychosis, but also in his good moments. I love this guy with all my soul, he’s very caring, smart, kind, funny, thoughtful and also hot af. When he doesn’t take his meds, I usually can tell on the first or second day that he didn’t take them, because the word salad starts spilling out of him. If he goes longer without meds, he starts acting ridiculous. He’s not dangerous, but he’s doing things like… He can walk up to a random person and spill a whole bottle of water on the ground while looking the stranger straight in the eyes and not saying a word, then walk away. Or he randomly starts crying and screaming. Or he destroys his phone and goes to live in the woods for a few days because he thinks that everyone knows him and can read his thoughts and manipulate them. Or he swears that planets talk to him. Ah, many of you here probably know how that works, so that’s why I’m here. 

When he stops taking his meds for a longer time, he starts believing that people want him to take meds because either they want to hurt him (meds are poison) or they want to manipulate his thoughts and steal his soul (meds have microchips or whatever). I don’t want to sneak his medication into his food, it just doesn’t feel like an okay thing to do and I think it would lead to trust issues and he would be scared of me if he found out (like I’m the evil one trying to steal his soul or something, because, you know, microchips). 

He’s currently in jail, because he stopped taking his meds and started doing drugs instead, went into psychosis, broke a window of a police station with a rock. 

He’s been addicted before and relapsed, it happens every time he’s off meds for any reason (missed the psychiatrist appointment, couldn’t afford the appointment, pharmacy didn’t have his meds). Luckily in jail they noticed that he’s not an evil person, just sick, and now he will have a detailed psychological raport written, he is required to see a psychiatrist once a month and show up to some place once a month to get checked. 

But he’s getting out sometime soon and I want to prepare myself to be the best supportive girlfriend. I want to know how to encourage him to keep taking his meds. I’m also a bit worried that the once a month control check could trigger the „ah they want to control my mind, they will do evil things to me, I’m not going” in him, and I want to know how to calm down these thoughts. And how to properly calm him down in general, if he gets worried about such things. I really want to spend my life with him and I know that bad moments will happen every now and then even if he keeps taking his meds, so I really want to know how to properly deal with that.

The 5th time a month ago I got rid of it and after one week I got sent to mental hospital again and am still in it right now. They gave me Quetiapin but I had a headache all day. Now I'm back to Olanzapine 7.5 mg.

I don't have a headache but my head feels heavy and I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing. I don't have the weight gain or anything I weigh 70 kg, male. But it makes me very tired and I don't want to do anything. Also I'm worried I will not find a wife and I never had a girlfriend. I am a little angry at my parents for giving me Olanzapine when I was 19 years old.

Back then it was because I was aggressive and had underweight 55 kg and got sent to mental hospital where they gave me Olanzapine but I think I would have recovered without this drug.

They say they will unalive me with a weapon from far away. I am going to visit a psychiatrist and apparently she is in on it too according to the voices. My apartment complex manager as well, and some family members  according to the voices.


The voices have their own thoughts, viewpoints, and opinions. Not sure how common that is. They rarely say the same thing in the same tone and mannerisms. They do repeat stuff but the tone and pitch and even the speed is different.


They speak in what appears to be 2 languages; English and Spanish. I can understand both and Japanese; but the voices have never talked in Japanese which is odd. Or any other language for that matter.


I have an appointment with a therapist tomorrow from SeaMar. I will let you know what happens tomorrow.

341,"my prodromal phase began in 2019 until my first episode of psychosis in march 2022. during the prodromal i didnt feel like myself and thought i lost myself forever. i experienced 2 months of psychosis in and out of psych wards where i experienced paranoid and persecutory delusions, delusions of reference, delusions of grandeur, thought broadcasting, thought-action fusion (TAF), magical thinking, catatonia, visceral hallucinations, possible unconfirmed auditory hallucinations, and other experiences i either dont want to mention or dont have words for.

after being held down and given 3 doses of invega sustenna in the psych ward, i blacked out for a while (people told me i did stuff that i did not remember) and i awoke out of psychosis unknowingly. i was mostly mute for a while after. i left the psych ward about a week after that. 

the next year at my parents i was mostly mute. i lucid dreamt almost everynight. i was completely conscious but had no control - most of the dreams were me floating around observing things unable to control my body, or being pulled through space in different directions often trying to hold on to objects to keep myself somewhere. i stayed on the medication for a few months but was adament about getting off of it as soon as possible, and i did. i wasnt sure if i would ever laugh again and i definitely didnt think i would ever feel like myself again. i experienced intensely uncomfortable physical and emotional depression coupled with obsessive suicial ideation. i had a plan and i was sure in my mind that i was going to kill myself. i blamed my own actions for ruining my life, and experienced intensely deep regrets that i believed i would never be able to let go of. they were my first thoughts every morning when i woke up. i was sent back to the psych ward for depression. i was put on anti depressants and got off of them as soon as i could. i felt miserable and i belonged nowhere.

back at my parents, at some point, and for no apparent reason, i began to try to become independent again. i started trying to get a job. eventually i found a roommate online, rented my own place, worked, reconnected with old friends, and overall began to get my life back. 

ive been off my medication and living independently (for the most part) for almost 3 years now. of course nothing is perfect, but i can genuinely say i enjoy life. i want to be alive. i feel like myself again (after almost 5 years of not). i can speak freely. ive laughed. im able to discover and enjoy music again. 

i genuinely did not believe this could be possible. connections that i thought were dead have been repaired or at least accounted for, and though there was a lot of genuine loss, many things have circled back that i thought were dead forever. new connections have enriched my life. 

though the suffering i went through was genuinely physically and emotionally destructive to myself, i dont want to forget it and i hope to continually derive strength from that past version of me that somehow held on through it all. 

to anyone suffering today or experiencing the depth and loneliness of schizophrenia/psychosis/depression/suicidal ideation etc. remember that life is change. thats the one thing we can count on. even if youre still suffering, your suffering will change. and the depth of human emotion you are able to experience is expanding with every new suffering. though suffering is intensely personal, it is also shared at the same time. my experiences bring me closer in understanding to many people. 

everything you believe you can experience is possible, but also everything you dont believe you can experience is possible as well. youre able to experience joy again, love, etc. we're not in control of everything. in a very large way we're not in control of how we feel. 

this story is cut and dry and leaves out a lot of complexity. there were moments of hope and despair within the good and the bad, and angels amidst. good luck to everyone on your journeys however short, long, wide or narrow. deep or shallow. None of us make it out alive, but for myself, I believe it's worth seeing life through and letting the world take me when it chooses rather than for me to take myself out of the game. because this shit really did surprise me when I thought life had already shown me everything it possibly could.

363,"Hello there. I don't have schizophrenia myself, but my mom does and I wanted to ask about her from someone who goes through the same thing, so I can understand better, because I've been just so down these days, hopeless about her behavior (or lack of) and I'm really anxious about future with her. I can't go on like this and can't make her change. I'm really down and don't know what to do. 

Long story short - my mom has paranoid schizophrenia, she's stabilized on Olanzapine and Haloperidol.  
She always (from what I can remember) had problems with personal hygiene, managing finances, managing her time, motivation issues (i second these), problems with decisions, etc. It's getting progressively worse, I was aware of that it will. But I don't think I can go on. She's 51. She's morbidly obese (about 130kgs) because she doesn't go out - at all. Not even to the shop to buy groceries, not at least 1 bottle of water or toilet paper. If she ran out of everything, I would get 100 calls, but she wouldn't go outside at any cost. She doesn't even leave the couch (only when she's going to the toilet). She never cleans anything, doesn't wash dishes after using them, doesn't take the trash out, but puts it on the balcony instead. My grandma (her mom) takes care of her, she's 71 and still working, getting the groceries, making sure food is being cooked (my mom doesn't cook at all, she hasn't made a meal in years). I (25) am working and studying at the same time, doing night shifts, navigating life and she is literally addicted to my persona. She's able to call me even 40 times a day, when I become mad, she starts playing little baby even with the voice, which ultimately makes me forgive her. She says she cannot live without me, doesn't enjoy life without me, etc. But even when I still lived with her in one room for my whole life, she's never been any different. Never did anything for herself - just was totally addicted to me. She doesn't shower, wash her hair, she oftentimes smells so bad we both have to tell her (even shout sometimes) to go to shower because she stinks. She has tons of medical issues but won't address them and go to the doctors. She's been on period (on and off with very small intervals) for 3 years and I always have to go out to buy pads but am telling her to go to the doctor's, she had to have blood transfusions because I called emergency one time, when she obviously lost so much blood she was as pale as a wall. They told her she needs to have her uterus removed - she doesn't care and won't do anything about it. Same with possible diabetes and a lot of spine problems. She can't even buy her own pads, go to the pharmacy for her own pills, NOTHING. But she's able to call 50 times a day. For the record - her legs are healthy, she's able to walk.

My grandma and I have been enablers. We never pushed her only by force, because if we did, she would argue so badly with us and even became emotionally violent and manipulative, it was pointless. But my grandma is old, my mom never worked, she's on invalidity benefit. I don't have the mental capacity to live with her, so I live elsewhere. When my grandma dies, I'll have to take care of my mom and her invalidity benefit will barely pay the bills. With her not being able to go out, or do anything in particular, I'll either have to move in with her and lose my sanity, or have her placed somewhere. What else could I do? Is there some approach I could try? I feel like I've tried everything, I offered help, I offered to go with her so we can learn to face the world, I tried everything. Nothing worked. Sometimes I think she's just lazy, so many of yall are probably able to keep up with basic stuff and there's no way she's not addicted to our help, rather than so miserable and sick. Please help, I'm at the end of my strength. ",schizophrenia

369,"Hey guys, lately, I've been struggling with distressing thoughts and feelings. They’re not external voices or visions; rather, they come from within, accompanied by thoughts and imagery. I’m  already on an antipsychotic for a year and another medication, but apart from walking, I can’t suppress them (and perhaps I shouldn’t) but to put it simply, I feel like I can’t cope. I’ve changed doctors so often that there are hardly any psychiatrists left in the city who don’t know me, regardless I’m left with any diagnosis and a little effective treatment. But that’s not really the issue. What I want to ask is, how honest should I be with my doctor about the thoughts and feelings I’m experiencing? Is being completely honest ethical, or could it backfire and harm me? Because of how painful these feelings are, my urge to heal and escape the pain often outweighs everything else, which leaves me feeling conflicted and impulsive in explaining. ",schizophrenia

371,"I’ve mentioned countless times through comments and one or two posts, about being unmedicated. I was diagnosed this past May. This month actually marks the one-year ‘anniversary’ of the point where my most recent episode became acute. I’m about 7 months sane now. Haven’t gone a full year without a full-blown episode in 5 years. I’ve had several bad days and a few weeks of returning symptoms since, but no full-blown psychosis.

Now when I was diagnosed, I was told to go to the ER but I was too scared to do so. I told my GP, who said I didn’t seem crazy and then refused to acknowledge the diagnosis or refer me to a psychiatrist. 

I went to a walk-in clinic and started trying to switch doctors. I have been working on referrals since August. Then I **FINALLY** got switched to a new GP two weeks ago. In one week, he found me a psychiatrist. All psychiatrists have refused to see me so far because they couldn’t handle a high-risk patient and all their waitlists were over a year long. They couldn’t squeeze anyone in. But I’m too well to go to the ER for a psychiatrist. So I’ve been stuck in limbo. Well, my new GP found me a psychiatrist in one week (last week) and my first appointment is for today. 

I will be getting my diagnosis confirmed today (it’s provisional right now, to rule out schizoaffective). And I will finally get some help with medication. The slightest bits of stress will cause symptoms to re-emerge. I feel fine until I am stressed in any way. I haven’t been working, I’ve been doing one course at university, two classes a week, and struggling with it. I love with my family and while I voluntarily take on responsibilities, little to no stress is added onto my plate. That is the only way I have remained in my right mind for the past 7 months.


I’m excited and nervous to talk to the psychiatrist today. Worried I’ll downplay my symptoms and not be taken seriously. Worried I’ll overplay symptoms and be overmedicated. I’m worried about the side effects of medications. But I’m also looking forward to getting a bit of life back. To getting to a point where I can push myself without worry of relapsing into psychosis if I get stressed. I am also nervously considering asking the doctor about going on disability, because right now I am 24, completely unable to work and am dropping out of university due to mental (and physical) health + cognitive impairments rendering me academically inept. I am worried about getting my hopes too high and being let down again. I don’t want to give up on myself. But even more than that, I know my parents wouldn’t be able to handle being let down again. They want me to be okay. I also want to be okay.

The weather is beautiful today and within the hour, I will have finally gotten to a psychiatrist, something that is a decade overdue.

Wish me luck! And I may update afterward 🌟",schizophrenia

A Letter to My Brother D
This is my autobiography of a personal battle with psychosis, trauma, and childhood abuse.  A journey to having the power to beat psychosis, come to terms with trauma, and not let events of my childhood mold who I will become in my future. This is a statement that no matter what, we all have a choice. Anyone going through the same or similar type of situations does have the power.  It all begins with self because self is the only tool that will pull you out of your own disconnect from reality.
To overcome guilt, to let go of what is out of your control, to allow yourself to forgive yourself, and not be afraid of what the future holds because there is a choice.  You have the free will to decide each step you take. But until you have a broad understanding of why you've taken steps and directions in previous sections of life, until you truly comprehend any potential obsessions you may be battling, moving forward will be a challenge.  There is a choice that will better yourself with each step. Nobody can help someone understand that. To understand that requires learning the psychology of the mind in a broad aspect. That requires diving deep to the root of the cause, no matter how hard it is. Until you face it, you can't move forward.
That is my fact to everyone because if you never understand how you made decisions in life, or why, there is no hope of moving forward in a positive direction.  You must jump back into that hell that got you to where you're at right now.  Understand it's not your fault, but now allow yourself to be in a position to change your future.  Find that place in your mind so you have the ability to confidently choose healthy steps to pull yourself out of that state of mind, whether it's psychosis, whether it's obsessions, whether it's hopelessness, whether it's questioning every decision you've made your whole life.  Because you will stop questioning. You will stop obsessing. You will stop feeling guilty. But that won't happen until you find and fight the root cause of why.
It's dangerous to go looking for that ""why."" And that is where using professional tools comes in. Whether any doctor has the real ability to help, that may never be the case.  But the tools that are provided will absolutely help set you on the right track to figuring out how to battle your own mind. Because in my experience, the go-to for doctors is medications, which has only ever worsened my experience.  This was true until I decided to take back control of my mind and my actions, and let myself find one person that I was able to just let it all out to.  I know some people are not that fortunate or lucky to have that person. Those roads are so windy, jagged, and treacherous.
The best person, in that case, would be the person in the mirror. Reading and learning psychology, studying the human mind, and seeing where these ideological obsessions or delusions stem from. There is a cause. There is always a reason. There is something. Nobody is born like this. You have a fighting chance to power through. It is not medically recorded that it's possible because you will be told it's not possible. Once you're psychotic, you will never be normal. You will be told that you will lose 10% brain function with each psychotic episode.
I am telling you that is not true. There's no physical way of factually proving that. Even though brain density scans may show something, it does not mean you're incapable of using what is there to go beyond that 100% function.  Because there are so many ways to help yourself that no one can help you with, no matter what it takes. You have to want to pull yourself out of that state, to do better, to put yourself in uncomfortable situations so you can overcome and overpower what's holding you back. I'm telling everybody right now, this is not permanent. There is a way out. There is a fucking light at the end of that tunnel.
I'm fortunate to have found that light. Not that every day is a good day, or even that life is easy, but I have the light. It's in front of me.  I am where I've asked to be. I am in reality, no longer out of touch with reality, no matter how hard this reality is. Now, I crossed the line that nobody has ever crossed, at least not medically recorded. I've done what was considered, bluntly, impossible. This is my story, and I hope I am able to help somebody conquer their own mind, maybe with that window of clarity they may have to read this. Because there is no clarity with disconnect in a delusional, psychotic state of mind. I hope this reaches the right person at the right time. I hope this can create a domino effect that can save so many lives.
What's it like to experience psychosis? I don't ever really know how to describe it. Outside of my best answer would be someone on a major acid trip. That's probably the best way to put it. Maybe to describe my psychosis, it would be like combining acid with peyote with DMT and ketamine. I feel like combining all those into one large dose and consuming that would probably be the only way anybody could comprehend what it's like to truly be in a psychotic state of mind.
You know, tonight, I'm having this unique moment of clarity. I'm not quite sure how to describe it. I suppose I can surf back on it.  Kind of hoping it rides. A different sense of peace, I guess. A small moment of, as weird as it might sound, feeling a little more human. As far as a bigger picture type of scene, I'm doing a little better reflecting. Maybe it comes from letting myself believe there are people who appreciate me, I guess. For so many years, you hear that. At least for me, it's not something I ever truly believed. Or maybe I just never let myself put any type of thought beyond just words.
Because I guess maybe that's all they've ever been for most people. Maybe partially because most people don't stick around often for the majority of life. But just thinking about the handful of people that I have acquainted with over the past two, three years. The ones that are still around and to this day show appreciation towards me. But something about tonight, it's like, you know, I do got those people. I'll try my best here to make it all make sense over text. What's the word for finally moving on, type of stuff? Closure, maybe, that sounds about right. Having a moment of closure, I think, and mixed with it, an actual feeling of hope. In a sense that there is a chance of a positive future ahead of me.
Maybe that, a mix of different types of believable anticipation. Like I had DeMarcus reach out to me today and tell me how much he appreciates me. That he's had respect for me ever since ""drive safe."" And then all these girls, which are not, you know, lifelong people that I'm going to have around, just more temporary fun, but give me that sense of feeling somewhat like people should, or well, that people do feel. Maybe the concept of my mind being in such a box my whole life with all the bad shit, that reality has never really been real. Not any delusional aspect, just a general... I've never even taken anything with a grain of salt, as people would say. Because I never really saw a future for me.
And I'm sure that has to do with Adam not being here. Maybe my mind was just like, ""Yo, there is nothing beyond the moment."" So my mind, I feel, just never let me go beyond the moment. It's a different feeling than being so hung up on my past or feeling guilty for actions or just decisions from the past. Even though I've had an understanding for the concept of, what's the word, obsessions, yet now have a broader view. Coming to terms, I guess you could say, with things I've always understood to a degree on a different level. But today, my view towards everything is okay.
Maybe getting past the angle of not being in control of all my fucked up obsessions that, you know, have stuck with me my entirety of life. And I'm sure you understand where that's coming from, not to rehash. But right now, it's like I'm okay with who I'm becoming and no longer questioning myself, becoming more confident. What has happened in my past, I don't have to carry with me going into my future. Because I know that's not who I truly am. It was only because of things that happened that were sadly way out of my control. Has it taken over 25 years to start taking back that control? Yes, but at least I'm here today having the ability to see that side of the picture, which I am grateful and fortunate for.
There's that part of me that's been stuck on, ""Oh, I've lost so much time being in hospitals that I wish I had with, you know, my grandmother or my brother, my grandpa and mom."" All the time I've lost. But that's all stuff I can't control. It's done. I have this sense of right now, okay, I can move forward. I am able to overcome difficult situations, yet no longer have to try to be anybody else for anybody around me. Because I'm finding people that appreciate who I am for me, not me trying to be somebody for anybody else. If that makes any sense. Growing up with all that shit tucked away, questioning myself. But now I'm grateful that I've been strong enough and have the intelligence to know that that stuff does not have to define me. I have luckily, yet unfortunately, but luckily to have gone through all this shit that I have gone through to now know who I am and not question myself any longer in life.
That's the saddest part about this world is these left-wing extremists, they're just all fucking mentally sick in the head. That has never been able to overcome or face the real fucking issue. They'd rather go with it and not tackle it head-on to truly figure out what the fuck made them who they are today. And now we're in a society of pushing this on the young generation, they don't even have a fighting chance, and that's the saddest fucking part. As fucked up as it is going through everything I've gone through in life, I am okay moving forward with knowing those are choices that I am in control of. Everybody else chooses to literally put themselves and keep themselves in their delusion of basically, I mean it's right out of a fucking psychology book, people who chase their abusers, I guess you could say. But people do it in a way of living out that life, never tackling head-on what the fuck caused the shit. And because of that denial, we now in this society think it's okay to just push this, all these influencers who never faced head-on the fact that 99.9 to the 10 million degree, and there's no debating me on this, has been severely fucked up by another person. But they're okay with completely blocking all of that out, sticking themselves in a lifelong loophole of self-destruction that they view as normal to society and fight to fit in when they're just fighting and supporting the root fucked up cause that made them that way.
Don't know why I'm getting so deep into thought. Maybe it's that clarity. I've overcome psychosis, which is, you know, medically unheard of, and I've gotten to the point of complete understanding on the psychological standpoint. So I guess it just saddens me to see the world around us allowing all this to be okay, just blows my mind. I can't be the only person that has this kind of understanding. I mean it is literally in a textbook. I guess I would never understand it anyways, that being okay with it or allowing everyone to accept it type of deal. Moving forward in life, man. My ambition stems from genuinely wanting to just help people that have been in this boat so the cycle doesn't have to continue. It fucking breaks my fucking heart, man. Anyways, I guess that's the best way I can write out where my mind is tonight. But more importantly, I have hope for my future, in our future, and that I am capable of doing good things and making great things happen with drive. Yes, that's part of it tonight, I think. I feel that drive, the motivation, the desire to see things through and make these good ambitions become that reality. Where we can do great things that we can influence in a positive way, I guess that's the best way I can put it.
I never, my entire life, had the comprehension to know how to have a relationship of any kind with anybody. I say relationship not like intimate type of stuff, but just in the general broad aspect. It's like in recent times I'm feeling as if I'm beginning to believe that's something I am capable of. I am okay with being the unique type of person I am because I have never been the one to want to truly fit in. Only ever out of a type of loneliness, I guess you could say. But never have been able to accept myself and always found a reason to tell myself I'm the reason that people are not capable of being in my life. When the reality is, the right people are going to be in my life. That's why it's not important to have a lot of people in life to be a part of my life. The cliche statement, better to have a small circle of individuals that are loyal and genuine than a big circle where you're spending your time questioning people's intentions. Yet in this moment of clarity and along my mind to open more, I am completely okay with me. Because the people who are with me and choose to stay are the people that belong in my future. People that I don't have to try so hard to be anything in particular around. Obviously, you are always that rock in my life, and that's putting it so extremely light, but you get what I'm saying. You stuck around through the hardest shit and I spent a lot of those years just not getting it. And as you know, some of those years worrying. Never knowing if you were going to say you've had enough. But that's not even a thought that goes through my mind anymore, hasn't in a good few years. Man, I'm privileged to have you as my brother in my life. If it wasn't for you, I'd be fucking dead, for real. I don't know how I would have gotten through the past 12 years. The fact is, I know I wouldn't have been able to. Whether that meant me not being here today or being in an extremely dark place with nothing, probably locked up in a fucking mental institution. Especially after Adam passed away, for sure, if it wasn't for you after that, I never would have been able to pull myself out of my mind.
It's been 4 years and 22 days since my very last major delusion setback. It's been... it's also been 5 years, 5 months, 20 days, give or take a day or two, that I had my last Invega shot. Have come so far, man. You know, going through this shit, I tell people it's like hopping in a time machine. One day you're, for the most part, a degree of normal, with a grasp of reality. Then once that red tape's crossed, then to spend upwards of 10 years being so stuck in the past that a future is not a real thing. To breaking out and being back in reality, there's a moment you look around you. In the last clear memories you have from when you were in grasp of reality versus seeing the age in everybody's eyes. Then having to accept the fact that there are people that are no longer here. Or looking at my animals, then being old, gone, grandmother no longer here, brother no longer living. A couple years back, I had that moment that I was playing with Grandpa's dog Sandy, and the last clear interaction I had was her being a puppy, running around full of energy, to being at that time old and slow. I had that moment that I was like, what the fuck? It's hard to comprehend that idea. It reminds me of the joke in 51st states, that dude being like, ""Bro, what's going to happen when she is super old, looks in the mirror and she's old?"" Same type of idea, just looking at the surroundings. Starting from before losing touch with reality to having complete control of sense of reality. It's that time warp, everything. It's like waking up from a coma and being told that most of the people you love are dead, your animals are dead, and the one pet you have left is suddenly 7 years old. To be stuck with not being able to change any of it. I don't know how well all that is comprehendable, sounds like something out of a movie. Reminds me of that time when I was on the phone with you and I was like, ""Is this surreal?"" I feel like my life has been like a game that's just been out of my control. The same day that you were like, ""Yo, let's start this business, that's get things going, come move to Hawaii."" And that same day, I wasn't exactly in an extreme delusion state. I think it was more of a, one of those moments that I had that little time lapse that, ""Oh, am I really here right now?"" type of deal in that moment. And that time in 2020, roughly right around the time I got my last shot, before that month, I said to myself, ""Fuck delusions, you know."" Cut out all my medications in the same couple months. Quit smoking, quay is my Adderall, for the most part, quit any kind of painkiller, stop looking for things to be fucked up on. Then you introduce me to supplements. I mean it was all uphill from there. I guess the past 5 years has just been spent comprehending the change around me from the 7 years that I was gone, here physically but mentally gone. The 5 years has been basically just catch up, catching up with reality, to my surroundings.

ok so i am not sure if this is due to the condition, but i wanted others input

social withdrawal was a big issue, originating in the prodromal phase id gone through. that was honestly the most concerning to people around me

im definitely in a much better place now, but ive realized that i do not ever reach out to anyone, with the exception of like… 3 people, and even then, i struggle with it. 

i’m talking: i don’t text people for their birthdays, this is a really big issue with my family, and with me making friends, i dont start conversations with anyone, i don’t reach out, or anything. Like… at all. i don’t know why, im not ignoring people intentionally, im not trying to be an asshole or anything, i just can’t actually do it. it’s like something is genuinely blocking me from doing it- i cannot properly explain this to anyone

i’m also not sure if this is related, but it’s a similar issue i have— for holidays, or events, not only do i have the issues i described previously, but i also just cannot give gifts to people. i don’t get why, i genuinely cannot do it- it’s not that i don’t want to, it’s not that i don’t care, i just can’t do it. i know what people want, i just can’t fucking do it?????? this could be perfectly normal and i could be overreacting, or i could just be an asshole, but i seriously don’t know anymore.

After learning about it in a psychology course, I researched some of the symptoms, and that heightened my fears because I resonate a lot with the prodromal phase right now. But I also know that those symptoms overlap with many different other possible diagnoses as well, and there's obviously no way of knowing what I'll experience in the future, but that doesn't stop me from being worried that my current mental state ""means something"". AFAIK I've never had a psychotic break, nor experienced hallucinations, but that has kind of led me to question how I'm supposed to know if something is a hallucination or not.

If you have schizophrenia, how are you able to tell that a sound you're hearing or something you're seeing isn't actually real? What's the difference between a fear and a paranoid delusion? Like I've always been afraid of the dark because it makes everything creepier and I don't know what's going on. Can fears lead to delusions, and how can I prevent that from happening? I honestly just have a lot of questions about what it actually feels like to experience psychosis, and I need some sort of confirmation that I'm not in a psychotic state all the time.

Sometimes it's hard to feel safe in life. But, if you have neurotypical family, or just family without schizophrenia, you can rest assured that if they were in grave danger they would not just sit there and twiddle their thumbs.

Maybe the material world has tricked our subconscious into not caring about these special gifts we have. My voices are nice and if they even get the slightest bit negative I walk away from said “voice”. I can question with my inner voice and get answers and it’s pretty awesome. You just have to get back in tune with yourself and meditate to be able to control your self a bit better when communicating back to the voices.

I mean I still have voices, but they're way more manageable now. In retrospect it kinda makes me feel disgusted by the medical industry with them basically tell patients they have no right to defend themselves or stick up for themselves inside their own mind. I swear to God, I've never had this much relief since I first started hearing voices. So I'm sick of it. I'm sick of psychiatrists and therapists that tell me how I'm supposed to manage my own life when they've never had to fucking deal with a hallucination in their God damn life.

Oh yeah, and if you look at my post history I just went on a rampage about being possessed by some form of invisible entity. Either like, aliens, demons, deities, or some other entity is out there harassing me. Or at least that's what I believe, I completely understand that no one else believes me. But from my perspective what happened is these voices that have been possessing me since I was young, and the instant I start standing up for myself they back down.

So you know? I don't know what to tell you guys. I wouldn't recommend doing anything this, because in concurrence with having a slightly more peaceful headspace the voices have also become exponentially more hostile. When they do turn up, that is.

I've suffered serious religious delusions thinking I'm Jesus or God the Father is talking to me and even that I was on fire or tortured by Satan. The only thing that brought me peace is throwing all of it metaphorically in hell and moving on without faith because there's no possibility anyone alive can make sense of the mess of my life.

You can look at my post history and see me talking to God and you won't believe me because you don't think I'm capable of talking to God well the truth is nobody is and it's a delusion. I'm so tired of people preaching utter lies and countries worshiping fiction to prove that's why they should be in power. It's a lie to control people and keep them from rising up against the government demanding rights and that's the real reason religion was created. I fought all the religious delusions the inauguration caused me to experience because it was like a church service and most religious stuff triggers my delusions and this is what came out. Pure logical thought is the correct belief system not superstition that makes life with schzioprenia so much more difficult. It's only when I think logically and ask myself if my thoughts are logical I can mitigate this illness and it may help you too to be more logical and question everything because sadly people lie or are mistaken even without the schzioprenia spectrum putting nonsense in their heads.

464,"Love is the single most powerful force known to mankind. It is no lie that it very physically affects your heart and entire cardiovascular system through it, as love itself pumps your blood and stimulates and regulates your nerves positively. Your nerves are your entire being, being responsible for physical sensation, mental clarity, emotion (which is energy), memory, and physical movement, your brain and consciousness being your nerves. When hearts connect, you become energetically bound to each other, and the more full and deep the love, the stronger the constant effects to your being will be. Not only are the physical and direct parts of love so strengthening, but (as a man) the idea that every thought and action that would otherwise kill me physically or mentally is in support of this one woman makes negatives or nervous conflict feel like they were nothing. The idea that as long as you are loved and appreciated by this one person that much is more than enough to make you undefeatable. In a relationship and in life, a man's strength and weakness comes from what he can see, and strength comes from feeding, detoxifying, testing, and un manipulating information and energy from his nervous system; the source of everything he has ever known or will know, felt or will feel, expressed or will express. It is your entire person. For a woman, her strength and weakness comes from what she can feel and make other people feel, having extreme amounts of control over others. The way she gains experience or makes her nerves stronger is by understanding perspective, and seeing what drove an emotional response. Nervous men will believe and be constructed by anything they see, either not wanting to or being unable to feel emotion, and nervous women will let any emotion they feel overtake them and how they deal with something, leading to harsh judgement, manipulation by men and whoring, becoming blind and unconscious.

Ego promotes extreme nervous reactions, as expectation is always bound to fall short, no matter how much you have to back it up, intoxicating and lowering you every time. Think of it like the worst drug imaginable. Not only does it lower you that much, but it also creates the same nerves in others who feel challenged by you, when you should be trying to create strength in them. Strength and knowledge 99% of the time comes from others anyway, whether it be through osmosis, a teacher, a friend, or a family member. Or even the negatives of someone you don't hold close at all.

Not just to a man, but to humanity as a whole, one of our greatest strengths is this osmosis, as any thought relating to the moment or information received, will instantly resurface it subconsciously. An example; “Oh I did something slightly similar to this 25 years ago and it didn’t end well, maybe I'll consider that first.” Humans do this without realizing how much strength is behind it, as it has an infinite amount of application, such as situational tactic, testing, turning emotional switches to love, destroy, inspire, or see through to name a few. What it does is give you the exact information learned at any point in your life, with the exact emotional energy needed to enact in any situation, assuming you aren't blocked by nerves. The stronger the nerves, the stronger the mind, the stronger all your emotions, the more you'll be able to see and feel societally, personally and interpersonally, while making this human strength that much stronger. In today's world, almost everything has some sort of nerve applying substance. Not just recreational drugs, but food additives, medication, preservatives, unnatural plant modifications, chemicals, and close to any substitute made in a lab. A new standard, and what effects what how has been forgotten and redefined so many times through history, perhaps not even known at any point as we didn't have to deal with all these taxations before the industrial revolution.

With the simple knowledge that emotion IS energy, energy is felt through the nerves, and that nerves and the brain can be detoxified and trained, we can create a borderline new (or discovered) race. A lot of nerves from people come from death being hung over their heads, but anyone and everyone that has ever died (and came back of course) have all accounted for there being ‘something’ beyond life. With real ‘unfalsified by narratives’ evidence being stacked more for that against, one can assume that it at least isn't just black then nothing. With that, much fear of life through death should be subsided logically.

just do anything to make your nerves strong as possible, reflect information, reflect positive energy to others' nerves, then everything else will make sense. think of it mechanically if you need to.",schizophrenia

479,"Sorry, I dont know which sub to write this. I usually use reddit for my hobbies but now I have a question. ive never had hallucinations but i think theyre starting and its scaring me. im 16(sophomore) and at night and sometimes day Im getting hallucinations. at night sometimes I wake up to someone screaming in my ear or i feel my foot or hand being tugged and I wake up in a cold sweat and cant sleep for another 20 minutes or so. 

As for day, they are more rare. It usually happens at school or when im taking a shower in the morning. Sometimes in the shower I hear someone call my name then I check and theres no one. i ask my family if anyone called my name and they said no one even tried to talk to me. also when my name was called it was vivid and decently loud, like right outside of the bathroom.

at school its not as scary but its embarrasing me infront of friends. in class, I hear my name so I answer loudly, sometimes in a silent classroom. One time I was walking alone from a class to lunch and i felt someone grab my shoulder, i turned around and NOTHING. 

This one only happened once, 2 weeks ago: It was after school at around 5:45 because i had band practice. at this time and where I live there is basically no one at school and it is pitch dark aside from the few lights outside of the campus. I swear to fucking god I heard someone (presumably female) scream my name. I mean a absolutely screeching scream. 

I would appreciate ANY insight. I take anti-depressants and sometimes melatonin to sleep. It started a month and a half ago. Im decently scared and embarrassed about it. this is not a joke.",schizophrenia

Im here because recently a voice appeared in my head. Not so recently, maybe more like a few months ago. Before he only talked to me but now we have conversations. He says he's an echo of me but not me. I think he is from another dimension. My boyfriend thinks its schizophrenia. My bipolar peers (im bipolar with psychotic features) think it might be psychosis. 
I talked to him and he said he'll be there forever and he never left since then. He talks to me all the time but my peers explained that he wasn't my friend otherwise he wouldn't tell me those awful things too. He's always two steps ahead he asks me to do things and then I do it and it ends up fucking me over almost every time somehow. He told me he's waiting for me on the other side. 

Now I'm convinced that he is real but it just seems crazy. Maybe a demon fell in love with me. 

I asked for opinions here after talking to the bipolar subreddit. Does this sound familiar to any of yall? Im not asking for a diagnosis of any sort just an opinion before I can talk to my doctor this Tuesday.

Again I don't wanna break any rules so i'm insisting that I only want to know if it's common in some type of schizophrenia.

519,"Hello all. My brothers and I believe our mom has schizophrenia. A quick google search of schizophrenic symptoms lines up exactly with how she’s behaving.

For context we know her brother has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, her father and sister also clearly have undiagnosed mental issues. I won’t get into many details but essentially about four months ago she had a complete mental breakdown when she and her boyfriend broke up and since that point she’s been pretty much off the rails (taping my dad’s ashes to the front door as a protection mechanism for example). 

Unfortunately we’re not really able to confirm whether she does in fact have schizophrenia or not as she refuses to get treatment of any kind. She says she had poor experiences with a therapist when she was a child and doesn’t trust modern meds, vaccines, mental healthcare, etc. It was only recently when we (or at least I) realized it’s likely schizophrenia, which made me a bit more sympathetic towards her. I haven’t talked with her in a few months to this point and don’t know if I’m really ready to currently. My brothers are still keeping some contact with her but at this point if I had to guess it’s 2-3 times collectively a month that they speak with her. We’re all pretty burnt out at this point. Aside from that as far as I know she’s pretty much kicked everyone out of her life because she “gives and gives and gives but never receives anything back”

Those who ended up getting treatment for schizophrenia, was it something where you eventually realized on your own that something was wrong or was someone in your life able to convince you? If the latter do you have advice in terms of how we can make her realize she desperately needs medical help? Thanks in advance. ",schizophrenia

dating as someone on the schizophrenic spectrum is already so hard as an adult, but i feel a different struggle being diagnosed as a teenager. i cant ""deny"" the disorder i have. instead of just trying to find someone to accept that i'm a bit different than other people, i have to be honest that i know EXACTLY whats wrong with me and what its called. i would love to pretend to be clueless and pretend but i have a feeling its too big of a lie. ive heard stories about someone getting diagnosed with a mental illness or physical problem years into a relationship and the couple works through it together. thats beautiful to me but i'll never be able to live that experience

i know this problem is very low on the scale of problems, but its so hard to find people accepting. people that will completely understand that schizophrenia is more than hallucinations and delusions, understand that i wont always be the best person. along with parts of my sexuality, i feel greedy to want someone who fits my standards but will also settle for my shortcomings

525,"Hi there, I’m M26 and brother is M34. Currently my parents and I are carers for my brother. He is not on meds (he used to before around 8 years ago but stopped voluntarily because he didn’t like how it made him feel i.e. drowst & ate a lot more than usual to a large extent). Any ideas to help him better?

His current main symptoms of concern (from observation): 

- Hears abusive voices and identifies them as countries i.e. China, USA, Ireland & British, Conor Mcgregor & some old friends he fell out with. He says that they invade his thoughts. [Most of the time they’re really negative and it encourages him to say mean & racist things, as if he’s a vessel and an echo chamber of the worst comments on the internet] **normally he isn’t racist**

- Noises/voices [parents and I have to be very quiet & more considerate than to how we move around the house otherwise it] may induce a physically aggressive psychosis i.e. Punching air, his hand, hitting the walls hurting himself, hitting my dad and I & breaking a lot of things [I know it’s not his fault but overtime it has been very costly over the years *and yes we have told him not to in the most respectful & calm way possible*].

- Altered memories and misidentifying them. E.g. he’ll remember something we’ve been to before as a family and say that we met a celebrity there when we haven’t. [I say this as a concern, brain health wise. I feel as though he needs a brain scan again as the last one he had was around 10 years ago].

- Anti-social behaviour; the worst of his psychosis at home (after the physical aggression/breakage of things) is when he shouts really loud angrily towards those voices & going outside in the garden or the house breaking things & causing a disturbance… in this point it’s so hard to reach to him and make him stop, he’s the biggest in the family and is a strong guy. We’ve been very fortunate to have neighbours to not call the police on us.  Lower tier ASB are when wakes everyone up at night being loud & later on after he’s calm down, acts like nothing happened & doesn’t feel remorse for it.

I really don’t know what to do to help and who to contact for help in this country. The ones I’ve contacted such as minduk, tell me it must be his choice and they’ll send me a couple hyperlinks that doesn’t help. I am open to suggestions ‼️

>>>>>>TLDR context<<<<<<

My brother was a passionate professional dancer, dance teacher, basketball enthusiast and artist at heart. Nowadays he stopped paying attention to those things and only dabbles with drawing & watches a lot of DVD’s.

He had his first psychosis in his early twenties that lead him to be detained in hospital for several weeks to a few months. I remember witnessing his symptoms of confusion and thinking that my dad, mom & I weren’t real and I recall that he had to be restrained multiple times due to the psychosis still being in affect. The doctors had told us from a brain scan that he had some damage/inflammation in his brain (idk where specifically) and that they did not know the cause or what it is. 

After things had calm down, the doctors approved that he can go back home and that the ‘healing’ may take many years. I don’t know what the term is for this, but for several months he had some healthcare people check in on him till they thought he was better. 

To cut it shorter, after many years of denial, confusion and a poor adjustment of me and my parents not understanding how to take care of him appropriately… I’m afraid that because of our actions, it made his condition worse. He was diagnosed with depression earlier on post psychosis (I’m unsure of the exact identification) and it was much later the schizophrenia symptoms & diagnosis came 

Unusual signs shown before diagnosis were:

-  Lip reading only when people are talking to him & when watching things on tv he’d mute and only lip read. 

- Seemingly random aggression

- Playing music really loud

- Hyperactive thinking that would go on for hours. 

It was only till later on (around pre covid during my uni time away & post-covid) that he became more aggressive and the abusive voices later on that he identified them as became what it is today. 

My parents are not getting any younger, and I’m afraid that his actions (even though it’s fundamentally not his fault) is tiring out my parents overtime. I don’t know how to help my bro to get the best help when he doesn’t want to get help… and since he’s an adult It’s been hard to get him help when I’m told that it has to be his choice.",schizophrenia

There is no reason to be aggravated, there is no reason to sever the truth, I am innocent, I am carefree, so why do I let myself be enveloped by malicious cathartic nonsense? My drive is blatant, perhaps it has been the driver, the overt status quo of negativity has been driving me home, such as my dad complaining about shitty drivers, well dad...

I cannot deny that I was the shittiest one. No one will believe me anymore. As some sort of mockery, or holy gesture, I am the sole one who can remember. When I was on the wrong side of the road, god expected it dad. God saved us, after the crash, and we've never been in the same world again. I struggle every time you talk about bad drivers, I struggle deeply with the acceptance that this happened to us. I killed you, and I didn't pay the price for it. Make me feel like crying.

I wouldn't have been able to turn the wheel. I would have been paralyzed. I would have cried, and cried, deep inside. I would have been petrified, frightened. My dad would have attempted to remedy. He would have attempted to turn the wheel. Only I would have stopped him. Because maybe my command took over. Maybe I am a malicious brute. I cannot make sense of it, unless I control myself with an ulterior motive. It's the only way it makes sense. I needed to die, to then survive.

Since we're already being open-minded, let us go all the way. I teleported. We can all teleport. I'd guarantee it. We just don't. We refuse to acknowledge it.

It changed my life, perhaps I really did cocaine after all, I don't remember a second of it. Yet, I do remember being comedically enthused, then comedically genius, then commiting my biggest sin yet. This is because I teleported, I ran really asininely fast then I teleported, as we're all futuristic beasts after all. I know deep down you all agree with me. Maybe you just aren't in touch with yourself.

My mind is blocking my thought process. It accompanies me on my journey, but it gives me its fair share of a hassle. I wish myself the best, as I see us for what we are, and it is a divine opportunity, to be alive. We have an agenda, to say the least, we're simply conceived to ignore it, to deny it. We are compulsive, obsessive. We are our expectations. We just deny it. In our acceptance is the grander acknowledgment, we are willing to submit to being normal, despite it not being all we have. The casualized endeavour is certainly for our long term prospect. We are controlling ourselves to achieve this, perfectly well. The truth is in the decor.",schizophrenia

While it has always been difficult being around my dad, his delusions have gotten much worse in the past year. Some examples include…

-He believes his wife (a filipino immigrant) is apart of the “filipino mafia” and her and her family are out to get him. Because of this, he has cut her family out of his life and is trying to divorce her. 

-He cannot hold a job and is currently living on disability because he thinks all of his coworkers hate him and want to ruin his life

-He has an apocalypse bunker in the basement with guns and canned food in case Russia decides to bomb us or if a solar flare starts the apocalypse

These are just a few, but it is so exhausting and stressful to see him live like this. Right now, I am one of the only people in his life that he still talks to because he cut everyone else out. Every time he has a delusion, I have to hold myself back from yelling at him about how he’s a paranoid schizophrenic and needs help. Right now, he’s in the hospital for a blood clot and he chose to goto a hospital two hours away from his house because he believes if he goes to any of the ones that he used to work at, the staff will purposefully mess with his treatment (he used to be a nurse).

We broke up early last year after 2.5 years because she feels its best to be
institutionalised since she feels worse every day. We cut contact until a few months later she reached out to me again asking if its okay to still be friends and support each other and of course i said yes, while we're not in a relationship anymore, i still would like to support her in any way i can since she only trust her mum, grandparents and me.

However soon after she got back, she's not getting any better, and spend most days watching porn and masturbate. She claims it makes her feel good to spend her days watching porn, not taking care of her hygiene and other stuff. It got worse to the point of stealing her mum’s money (they live on disability checks), and sending her mum porn. Her mum said it was okay at first, but eventually asked her to stop because she cannot take it anymore. She received about 50 images/videos every day. My ex told me she doesnt care that she takes care of her all this time, she just want to get wet and by doing that, it makes her wet. It makes me very sad but im not sure what to do, until a few days ago she said her inner self talked to her and she should stop doing everything. And just like that she quit.

Now, with everything going on with the world, she said the black people deserves to die, and she supports the current US president by claiming he is a good person, and his policies are for the good of mankind.

She often said some people doesnt deserve to live based on their skin color or religion. Thats very extreme. She thinks children dying in africa is funny. Idk if thats the psychosis or what but this upsets me very very much.

We went through a lot together. I stayed with her through thick and thin. But at what point that its not healthy?

Regardless how i feel about things, what do i do? Do i leave her? How do i even deal with all of this? She wasnt like this before. I am at loss. I am devastated. I thought i have her back by stopped masturbating only to find her like this now. 

Please help me! Thank you!",schizophrenia

551,"TW: current state of affairs in the united states

My partner has schizoaffective disorder and has expressed how keeping up with the news can exacerbate feelings of paranoia and delusional thinking. despite keeping myself pretty well informed on the state of the world (it's def not helping my own mental health but like that's a different story) i dont mind there being a boundary about not talking about the state of the world all the time. they're very good and letting me know when they're starting to recognize the paranoia and delusional thinking and we can talk a lot of it through and kind of reason some of it out, etc. however the current state of the u.s. has me caught in a really awkward position. 

brief background on me before getting into this any more: i have a degree in political science and journalism, plus im autistic with a special interest in propaganda, fascism, and genocidal regimes. So i tend to lean a little more on the suspicious of the world side of things anyways. 

here's my dilemma: we're both trans people in the middle of transitions, name changes, gender marker changes, scheduling surgeries, etc. living in the united states. while we are in a state with more protections, that obviously doesnt guarantee anything. 

these factors have brought up a lot of anxiety for both of us and we're both reasonably worried. so this is where i'm struggling. i don't know how to best support my partner with their bouts of paranoia and delusions when it is a scary time to be alive and there is such a legitimate threat toward trans people in this country.

also: while i've learned a good amount from both my partner and other people online sharing their own experiences with schizophrenia, i'm still not the most informed and am still learning a lot. ",schizophrenia

553,"Sorry if I’m bad at expressing myself, english is not my first language and my brain can’t function even in my first language. 
But I’ve been thinking about people who say they’ve/others been in spiritual/religious psychosis. I myself have been in spiritual/religious psychosis where I’ve been very delusional and completely unaware of reality with a grandiose thinking believing I was a part of God and had to kill myself to become one with the universe etc. I don’t know if you guys have come across the same content as me at the internet, mainly tiktok. I’ve noticed people using psychosis very “easily” and referring to example when using crystals became a “thing” (think it was like 2020?) and seeing signs (I don’t know if you remember that “trend”, at least it was a trend where I live). Many claim they were in spiritual psychosis, yet they lived their life normally. People in the comments is like “yeah totally, I couldn’t believe I fell for that I was completely delusional” and so on. I don’t want to take anything away from them or question their experience in that was, I just can’t help wondering how they view the term psychosis because I have a whole other perspective on it. This was just an example of what I’ve seen. I don’t mean everybody lies I just think it’s strange so many people say they’ve been in psychosis because they, from where I stand, just have experimented with their spiritual side.
Another thing I’ve noticed on the same theme is people calling religious expressions psychotic. One thing I saw was a religious person calling the fires in Californa “a message/threat/consequence from God”. I don’t agree with the statement but from a religious persons perspective I don’t feel it’s that far fetched. Many people who are religious derive incidents to have a connection with God, both good and bad, because that’s how religion works. People on tiktok commented this statement and said that the religious person was in psychosis but didn’t realise it. I’ve seen so many posts about people saying other people are in psychosis, but if a person’s been religious their whole lives, does this mean they’ve been in a lifelong psychosis? I find it hard to believe. 
My experience, and many others I know that’s been diagnosed with psychosis or a psychotic illness don’t agree with the things many people explain as psychosis. I can’t help but feel diminished and I get very frustrated when people call just basic spirituality and religion psychosis, as I can see it. I get the feeling many people are uneducated around this subject and use this word way too lightly and just spreads misinformation which make more and more people think they’ve been in psychosis. Of course I don’t mean someone who says this necessarily hasn’t been in psychosis I just think many people don’t really get what psychosis means.

566,"Hi,
I was diagnosed at age of 29 (paranoid schizophrenia). From that time I had few schizophrenic episodes, I wasn’t hospitalized, always recovering at home. On day-to-day basis I can live normal life - there is no chance that someone will notice smth strange in my behavior… for my it is hard to believe that I am schizophrenic. Sometimes I hear voices in my head and I am scared/suspicious about conspiracy against me. 

I am wondering is it possible to develop such symptoms as a result of undiagnosed disorders - spectrum of autism or ADHD.

What I noticed in my behavior:
- procrastination,
- scared to start new things, but also having a lot of ideas about things I can do,
- it is hard for me to keep eye contact, I can say that I am forcing myself to do it,
- when I started ground school my mom was invited to the classes to watch out me - as I was swinging my legs constantly, now I am only  wiggle my toes a lot,
- I am easily getting addicted,
- usually I wake up without energy, but at the same time I feel energized at the evenings/nights,
- I cannot make any plans for the future, because I simply do not think about it,
- I am highly sensitive person and I catch a lot of signs from others, what makes me overwhelmed sometimes, usually during group meetings - I control other people, their expressions, tone of the voice, everything what can give me a sort of „information” about someone,
- I noticed long time ago that it is hard for me to keep conversation ongoing, and I use standard questions which were heard/learned when others were talking
- as I child I had lot of various interests, but I wasn’t able to keep a single one for a longer period of time, I am easily bored or I don’t believe that I can master smth, there is always someone who is better then I am, nowadays I do not have hobbies at all, 
- I used to blame myself for being the reason of other’s people negative emotions, 
- it is hard for me to concentrate on reading, I don’t understand sentences or do not remember what I read a while ago,
- I am not interested in games at all or TV (past 2 years)
- I can constantly listen to the same playlist or eat the same food daily,
- I rarely lie, what is problematic sometimes, because I say smth other people don’t want to hear,
- I am also people pleaser, I want to make everybody satisfied, 
- few people sad that I am weird, but I don’t understand in what way.

I want to understand myself, to be able to be a better person for myself and others. Is anyone of you diagnosed as schizophrenic and being autistic or have ADHD at the same time?

567,"**Dear Community,**

First and foremost, I want to say that you are all incredibly strong individuals, and I truly hope that one day there will be a treatment to ease your suffering completely. I'm reaching out here because I’ve been experiencing some puzzling symptoms that no doctor seems to be able to fully explain.

To give you some context, I’m 24 years old and have been struggling with OCD and a deep fear of developing schizophrenia or psychosis. When I was 16, I experienced what could be described as a drug-induced psychosis, which involved paranoia and seeing shadow figures out of the corner of my eye. These symptoms subsided once the high wore off (I had only been using cannabis).

However, after that, I began experiencing severe perceptual disturbances, such as derealization and depersonalization. I also noticed ""breathing"" or warping walls, wavy lines, and other visual anomalies. Over time, these symptoms diminished significantly, but I was left with lingering issues—such as my visual field becoming blurry or distorted when I fixate on an object. I also suffer from **Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS)**, if anyone is familiar with that condition.

Currently, I’m dealing with the following symptoms:

* Walls, doors, and objects that seem to ""breathe,"" distort, or move sideways.
* Flickering or unstable visuals (almost like an illustration that won’t stay still).
* Tinnitus.
* Extreme brain fog.
* Paranoid thoughts (though I suspect these may be tied to my obsessive research on schizophrenia).
* Existential fears, panic attacks, and depression.

That said, I’ve never experienced a full-blown psychosis—no voices, no delusions, or anything of the sort. My doctors have leaned toward a diagnosis of derealization syndrome rather than psychosis. In my family, no one has a history of dissociative disorders or schizophrenia. I’ve had extensive neurological tests (MRI, EEG, optic nerve assessments), all of which came back normal.

I’ve tried various antipsychotic medications like **Abilify, Risperidone, Quetiapine, and Olanzapine**, but none of them helped. I’ve heard that medications like **Lamotrigine** could be effective, but my doctor refuses to prescribe it. Personally, I suspect it might be **HPPD** (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder).

Does anyone here have similar symptoms or experiences? Any insights, advice, or shared stories would be greatly appreciated.

Wishing you all health and strength,  
Warm regards!",schizophrenia

Also, last week one on my coworkers spoke out in front of our entire group of coworkers ""she's a schizo! She's a schizophrenic!"" Referring to one the guests we were talking about but it felt like she came out sideways wanting to insult me, at the same time?

I feel like I am doing well with my job. I really like it a lot. And I really need my job. I live alone, I don't depend on anyone for anything. I've come a long way, living with this illness.

Now I'm just starting to worry that they are going to sabotage me and I'll lose another job.

586,"Hi all, I am making this post as I am progressively becoming more desperate for help and growing more worried about my father's behaviour. We live in the UK but we are from Poland, we have permanent residence. His actions severely hurt me as a child both developmentally and physically but I am adult now and I want to help protect my little brother, because I do not want him to share the same problems I was left with as a result of my father's behaviour. My father no longer lives with us but has joint custodial rights with my mother and sees my brother on weekends. Out of concern for my brother's safety, I often tag along for safeguarding purposes. I am bigger than my father and can stand up for my brother if my father ever tries making him do anything harmful but I have started my medical gender transition a couple months ago and have lost most of my physical strength very quickly and I'm afraid I can't be as imposing as I had once been, he belittles me a lot now for being trans a lot and talks over me and tell me to be quiet if I every try intervening with what he tells my brother. My father tells my brother that he is full of parasites and makes up random health disorders and makes him feel awful about himself. He buys weird health pills online and tells my brother to take them, mostly bogus supplements. I was unable to go with them recently and my mother found out after he dropped my brother home after being meant to take him to the pool that he had instead taking him to some woods and made him go into a river/stream in the middle of winter and my brother got really sick afterwards and had to miss a week of school. When I asked him why he did this, he said that he did it because cold baths ""cure everything."" He told me some story about how a long time ago a king was dying from some disease and nobody could cure him but when he was dunked in a bath of icy water he emerged in perfect health and told me that he made my brother swim in that freezing river in the middle of winter to detoxify his body of the lead he claims the people in power poison everybody with and to kill the parasites he claims his body is full of. Recently he also has taken his council bin and has started filling it up with water so he can also take these cold baths because he only has a shower at home, I included a photo to at least prove I'm not making these things up. I also have recordings (in Polish) of him rambling with no end about other things I've described here.     

All that aside, my father is clearly unwell and poses a threat to me and my brother. He has also made my aunt living in the UK fear for her life before, he visited her in her home with her then-infant son with nobody else there and made her listen uninterrupted for 2+ hours about how he is Putin's son and the second coming of Christ and spewed a bunch of extremely hateful antisemitic conspiracy bullcrap at her to the point she genuinely felt unsafe and broke down crying to my mother afterwards.

590,"Zdravím, už asi 13 let mám problém který mi zůstal po mém experimentovaní s marihuanou v mém mládí. V jeden nepovedený večer kdy rodiče byli na dovolené jako každý rok jsem pozval kamarády na byt že popijem a trochu se pobavíme. Už od rána jsem ale byl nějaký divný ale neměl jsem ponětí jak fungují halucinogeny. No zkrátím to. Večer jsem začal mít pocit že mi všichni v mistnosti čtou myšlenky. Začalo to vše pomalu až se to rozvinulo v psychózu kterou jsem měl myslím skoro rok. Nevěděl jsem v mých 16ti letech o tomhle ani trochu a vše co se mi dělo jsem myslel že je pravda a tak jsem ani neřešil co se se mnou děje. Dodnes mi zůstalo přesvědčení že mi každý čte myšlenky a nedokáže mě nic přesvědčit o opaku. Chtěl bych si zde najít někoho kdo by tohle taky zažil nebo zažívá a chtěl by se o tom s někým bavit. Na internetu v češtině není nic co by si o tom člověk mohl zjistit. Pokud by se někdo našel kdo by si chtěl o tomhle promluvit i klidně kdo nic takového nezažil a nemá nikoho komu by se mohl otevřít ať se ozve a moc rád si s ním napíšu. Více nebudu rozepisovat protože by to nikdo číst asi nechtěl. Tak se mějte a přeju hezký den. 😊",schizophrenia

This illness is so traumatizing, and most people don’t ever understand what it’s like. My parents were giving me shit for MONTHS when I was unmedicated and couldn’t function.

It's not an academic book - it's more of a ""popular psychology"" book, and might even be considered self-help. It was likely written by an author with a PhD in psychology, or perhaps a psychiatrist.

The book made an argument about treating mental illness differently. It argued that someone should be encouraged to process and come out the other side instead of treating symptoms by suppressing. That is a very poor summation that is probably incorrect. *I am not arguing for the validity of this approach* \- I am just curious to examine the book once again.

I believe the book discusses, at least briefly, Kurt Vonnegut's son and his bout with schizophrenia. It's possible that I'm misremembering and that I learned of Vonnegut's son elsewhere, but I think it's in the book.

621,"Hey everybody, it's the overly-intense dickhead moderator here. We've got some piping hot announcements for you, fresh off the press.

# Politics

Much to my extreme disappointment and surprise, it seems that ""doing things that Nazis do is bad"" and ""we're going to block links to a platform owned by a dude cozy with white supremacists who also cheats at video games"" was very contentious around here. One of our moderators got a little fired up over that, and we do apologize for any statements that may have crossed a line. Some people voiced that they just plain don't care about politics, or don't want to see it. However, a lot of people are quite concerned about the state of things.

So, we have a solution for that.

We are implementing a new scheduled post every Thursday (starting the 30th) exclusively for the discussion of political topics. Having it all consolidated in one place makes it easier for those who just plain don't want to see it to scroll on by and think nothing further of it.

If there is any *heavily* politically-related posts outside of the megathread, we will remove them and direct people to post where it is most appropriate. Normal garden-variety politics is still fine, though.

Moderator involvement in these threads will be minimal. We ask that you use the report button to call attention to anything that may violate our subreddit rules. Otherwise, it's fair game.

# Crazy Nice People Discord (Cult)

There's cause for celebration here. I go into a little more detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1i8npwz/crazy_nice_people_a_tale_in_four_parts/), and for background, our previous megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/s/IpntT7TrcX), and a more thorough breakdown of CNP [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/notices/problemgroups/#wiki_crazy_nice_people_.28discord.29). (TW if you've ever been a stalking victim or involved with a cult)

Long story short, CNP has been dealt yet another crippling blow by having their most recent sham subreddit, r/psyschoticfriends, shut down by Reddit's admins. This makes #4 of the communities that their Discord being involved with resulted in being entirely shut down.

We are hoping that the particularly spectacular degree of humiliation with this one *finally* results in them realizing that r/schizophrenia is not their hunting grounds and they should go elsewhere... like Facebook, or Instagram. Zuckerberg practically rolled out the red carpet for them with recent content moderation changes, so hopefully they take the *strong* hint and move on to greener pastures. (E: if you're curious what I mean by 'spectacular degree of humiliation,' I'm referring to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychoticFriends/) specifically)

The information we have gathered about CNP will remain up so as to serve as a warning to anyone who wants to do their homework before joining this group, even on other platforms beyond Reddit (with a quick Google search to check the name, it should pop up). However, that is the extent to which it is our problem; we have our due diligence in making sure our community is safe from their predation, and really have no desire to press the matter beyond the confines of Reddit. While we will continue to coordinate with any other subreddits related to mental illness that are afflicted by the presence of this group, what happens on FB or IG is Zuckerberg's problem, and not ours. While that may disappoint some of you to hear, I may remind you that we are volunteer internet janitors who are not getting paid to do this and are quite tired of being cyberstalked/harassed by this cult.

However, we would be more than thrilled to continue stomping on the cockroach as many times as it takes until it stops moving for good and *finally* gets the message that they are not welcome here in any way, shape, or form- and move on from Reddit entirely and permanently. The example we have set will *hopefully* deter future attempts by CNP- or *any* cult, really- from trying any funny business here again. We have a rather robust training manual to refer to at this point for any type of cult-y nonsense that may come around in the future.

We will resume our moratorium on any mention of CNP- or those involved with running it- shortly. The cult has a burning desire to remain relevant, and we also try to remain sensitive to the former members who suffered abuse at the hands of this cult who wish to move on from it. This is an exception to that because it's *good news*, but nonetheless- they're past-tense here for all intents and purposes.

With all the other shit going on, the uncertainty of it all... we gotta look at the bright side, and take what victories we can in the situation. For us (the mods) and the former members of CNP, this is a pretty big victory.

# In Closing

Well, that's about all I've got for you right now. New politics megathreads and CNP getting dealt yet another crippling blow is about all for today. Stay tuned for any further nonsense that may arise.

As always, our official moderator posts are open to public comment... for *anything*. If you want to call us dum-dums and tell us our faces are stupid, go right ahead. I'd *prefer* that criticisms be constructive in some form or fashion, but that's not a requirement.

The same thing happens when I listen to music too, when I hear specific lines, I think that I’m singing those lines offensively to someone and making them upset and they start to hate me.

626,"I don't know who out there needs to hear this, but I know I did at one point. Psychosis takes over sometimes. It makes you act in ways you regret. You push away people you care about. You say things you never would otherwise. You believe things that might actually be detrimental to mankind as a whole. Psychosis will do all these things and more.      

While, thankfully, I have never physically harmed someone because of psychosis, there are those of us out there who have. You are no more at fault for what happened than someone who just developed narcolepsy while driving and maimed an old lady as she was crossing the street. The narcoleptic didn't kill the old lady (if you're wondering how that story ends). She did spend seven weeks in the hospital moaning, however. Sometimes, when the morphine hit just right, she was kind of glad it happened.  Still, the driver definitely regretted having narcolepsy at the end of everything.       

We're like people who have the rarer kind of Tourettes that makes them scream obscenities in front of small children. As terrible as that is, it's not their fault.              

My point is--psychosis really can take over sometimes. While I don't believe that psychosis is literal demon possession, it can feel that way. Why? Because we've lost control of ourselves. It's not our fault. It's not our doing. When we're psychotic, it's like someone dosed us with acid without our permission. The things we think, say, and do might not be something we're ever proud of after all of it is said and done. Still, it was the drug's fault--not ours.     

So, whatever you did when you were psychotic--forgive yourself! Please. I'm begging you. It wasn't you. Praise God, it wasn't you. ",schizophrenia

628,"Hi! It's been a while and I doubt anyone remembers who I am here, which is probably a good thing, but it's whatever.

If you don't want to read this, sorry it's long, feel free to ask questions in the comments.

In July of 2024 I went down on the dose of my abilify injection. It is now late January of 2025. I'm here to write my retrospective on the experience. Overall, it's been positive with caveats.

First the positives: I feel more social, more connected to others, I have a wider range of emotion. Before when I was on the 400, I would see something distressing or happy and it wouldn't make me feel much of anything. I just felt very mellow and unaffected by everything, all the time, on the 400mg dose. That can be a welcome change, but I wouldn't want it to be permanent. Life has to have sparkle.

It was 6 or so years on the 400, so this is a big change!

Other positives: LESS AKATHISIA, FINALLY!!! It got worse when the dose lowered and then it got MUCH better. 

Less muscle shaking when I go down stairs, so less muscle weakness. Before it felt like my legs were about to give way and they shook visibly.

Negatives: It was controlling my OCD symptoms as well, so those have gotten worse on the 300. Some nights I snap awake thinking ""Did I lock the door?"" and then I just have to go and check. My doctor is putting me on clomipramine for this, which I requested. Also, racing thoughts. I've always been a prolific thinker but now I have more thoughts than ever.

I dream of being free of the abilify, as it has given me a host of negative effects like 50 pounds of weight gain, high cholesterol levels, muscle problems, possibly tardive dyskinesia developing which has slowly been getting worse for years, akathisia (which has abated for now) and sometimes tremors, which have also abated on the lower dose.

My eventual goal, as stated before, is to be completely medication free, but if I have to, I would prefer to be on lowest possible dose. 

The 300mg dose metabolizes faster than the 400mg dose, the half life is a month or 30 days compared with the 400mg which has a half life of 46.5 days on average. Which means that if I want to lower further I would have to take the pills. HOWEVER I do NOT tolerate the pills as well as I do the injections. They don't make a dose lower than 300mg for practical reasons, because then blood abilify concentrations would fluctuate too much, and destabilize the individual. Stretching out dosing intervals from 4 weeks to 5 weeks or longer isn't recommended based on the research I read because it causes blood levels to fluctuate even more. In short, if I want to go lower I need to take the pills.

However, a lot the research I've read (actual research on PubMed and the like and not random google articles) recommends tapering over years, not months, and certainly not immediately, which is why I decided to post this when the lowered dose from the 400 would be the worst. But it doesn't seem that bad at all, tbh.

It's not bad, I think. Given that I am under tremendous stress and grief from the loss of 2 close relatives and a close friend, returning to college, various other things like emergency surgery in the family and the politics of our times, I am doing extremely well! 

The symptoms I feel may be due to the lower dose, and/or they may be due to stress. In order to prevent shocking my nervous system I'm starting the new medication (clomipramine for my OCD symptoms) at the lowest possible dose, and holding off on lowering the abilify further for a few months probably.

A note about something I've noticed from lowering abilify: each time it begins to wear off, I feel incredibly good. Then I crash. I've already gone through my ""feeling great"" stage but I am feeling good once more, so I wonder how things will play out in the next several months. 

I will keep y'all updated if y'all want to hear it!",schizophrenia

I thought about starting off light with not too much of a stressful job maybe something like a delievery job.

Is this all just wishful thinking because when i ve had epsiodes its been pretty severe but i am in a good place mentally right now.

People tell me it’s the medication, some say it’s a negative symptom.  


I can’t work right now am in unpaid medical leave.  But I have to go back eventually and I just feel like I can’t handle it.


I was looking into disability but my parents were so ashamed of me looking at it I decided not to apply.

It gave me some peace and a strange calmness. One I've been allowed to draw so far, gave me not just a clean look of them but ""understanding""(don't think the right word exists). I can now see  that they suffer just as much of the constant pain as I endure. The one I was allowed to draw I now consider a friend and cherish, I think they at least are appreciative. The heart wretching crying has softened and they whisper supportive and comfort directly to ME. Instead of the me I use to drown out the noise(there are not multiple of me I lack better wording for it) 

But after an unintended drunken blackout I woke up to find both the drawing of my friend and ME ruined beyond Repair.(Took a picture of both day before so I have the memory that can't be alteredluckely
It's like I've lost something important to my core existence with the drawing of ME that I can recreate or ever see the result of what I am . Even the  tormenter I consider a friend won't even scream at me anymore let alone give out more than whimpers.

This is bothering me quite badly, I have big problems accepting the world around being real and  me and I'm fine being a husk, it's like I lost the last shred i had of me. 
Did I remove the last part of me that's real?
Have a lost the friend who dared show it self?

Anyone have any recommendations of medication that would work the same ? I’m thinking clonazepam would help me through the week, if I could have some on hand, just in case I need it.

Long story short, fuck Elon Musk- for a number of things.

We are officially banning links to Twitter/X as a result. Some places are making this about fascism or something, which I guess is *partially* true here, but even more than that- he sucks. He just *really* sucks, and his platform sucks too.

Honestly, considering what this community is *about,* pushing a chip in the brain is probably more pertinent than doing the salute.

# What's different?

Well, next to nothing. Rule 13 (Misinformation) usually catches content from Twitter/X or the various facets of Meta's enterprises. Links to Twitter or FB/IG are fairly rare around here already... like, exceedingly rare. So now we're just kind of trimming the fat to make our jobs easier.

# This seems like a stunt.

Oh, it totally is. 100%. This is a gag and completely for yuks, and if it weren't easy as cake to implement (the Automod code is so simple even I can do it) then we wouldn't be doing it.

At the end of the day, it's not much more than another tally on the list of subreddits shutting it down. Maybe some people might think it's funny that our primary reason is a bit 'different' than most subreddits. There is no bigger purpose or crusade here aside from some cheap yuks.

Most of what comes off of X/Twitter related to psychosis is utter trash anyways, so this is more of just driving home the point with finality. Our overarching mission here is to keep shit real... and whatever's going on over there departed from 'real' quite some time ago. Might as well cut the cord for good.

# You don't seem to be taking this seriously.

We're unpaid internet janitors. I act my wage. I am the epitome of professionalism when I am actually getting paid to do that, but that is not the case here. If you want professionalism and seriousness, I take tips on CashApp.

This whole broader situation is frankly terrifying. The least we can do is make jokes and laugh about it, because the alternative is just freaking out and/or crying because things are *not* okay here in the US.

So, hopefully this has been validating- and if not, at least funny. If neither of those are true... well, sorry for wasting your time.

Whatever criticisms can be made of us here, there's one thing you can never say- we aren't fake, and when we say our mission is ""keeping shit real,"" we are 100% dedicated to that and follow through.

Take care, everybody... and keep it real.

ETA: I figured this would be a softball, and I am extremely disappointed that it was not. Apparently I need to spell some things out here.

1. Elon Musk did a Nazi salute *twice* behind the seal of POTUS on TV. You can go look it up yourself. It happened, it was a Nazi salute. Unless you know better than [the ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/hitler-salute-hand-sign) what a Nazi salute is, seems like a disappointing number of people think that they do.
2. Musk has thus far refused to *apologize* for doing this, suggesting it was not accidental.
3. In Nazi Germany, schizophrenics were rounded up and exterminated/castrated. That is what Nazis do, what they have done, and what they would presumably do again if given the chance. These people believe your genetics are inferior and want to purge you from the gene pool.
4. Prior to the last 10 years ago, ""fuck Nazis"" or ""fuck white supremacists"" was not a controversial or political statement whatsoever. It was something of bipartisan agreement between anybody who was decent.
5. Twitter/X is a poorly-moderated cesspit of misinformation and hate speech, and nothing of value is lost.

As much as I enjoy seeing this made out into some sort of a ""political issue,"" if ""white supremacy and hate speech are bad"" is a political issue for you, you're backing the wrong horse. This is a matter of *basic human decency*. It's a statement of how far we've fallen as a country that something so uncontroversial for the last 80 years has somehow become a ""political issue"" and I sure as hell don't feel like it inspires confidence.

I can't disclose everything that happened because I was threatened in another reality and if I discuss certain details I will get taken back there and most likely kept there. So...I laid down in bed an hour or two ago because I got overwhelmingly tired when I shouldn't have been since I woke up at 1 this afternoon. Let's just say my brain started pulsing which happens every time I'm getting spiritually attacked.I kept nodding off and my vision started to double and before I knew it I was completely paralyzed. 

I saw some things that were scary and strange that I can't talk about. Let's just say that I have my own proof that Schizophrenia is NOT the brain simply going haywire or playing tricks on us. There are people and entities in other realities messing with us and they can take us to these other realities whenever they feel like it. Like I said ....I saw some things in my room including a person behaving weird, having one of my old songs played back where I was growling lyrics and then the voice said ""You know what Daddy's gonna do?"" 

Then while in paralysis I felt my body get heavy and something else that I can't explain because they don't want me to.I felt my soul vibrating or speeding up as I was being prepared to be taken to another reality.I started seeing a circular aura of light burst two or three times before I went to this other reality. Also a wide and thick column of grey smoke like material formed like a vortex from the top of my ceiling down to where I was lying down.When I got to this other reality what I saw there were other people who appeared human...or maybe they were posing as humans. 

There were five of them sitting in a circle in some room and they knew everything about me.I was a little scared and had my head down and one of them told me that he wants me to look at him. I couldn't even lift my head up to see what they looked like except the dude on my left.The one to my left had a giant dark red almost black mask on that was bigger than his face with spikes coming out of it ....or at least it appeared to be a mask.I asked them if I could go home and they said ""Ah man, ....just when we were getting some good company"". 

Before I was taken to that other reality there was definitely someone standing over me from behind with giant arms but I couldn't make the figure out and then I said "" I knew I was gonna go to Hell ....I just knew it."" Then I asked if I was going to be returned home and one of them said ""Don't worry, we got you covered"". This all happened right after I got done watching porn....so they clearly are twisted beings that actually want me to stay off of porn and they mess with me to scare me into doing the right thing. Well I can tell you that after that experience....I am never going on porn ever again. 

I guess there has to be some kind of Creator out there in the cosmos because evidently these beings I met exist as well as the voice.There's beings in my room that I can only see when they want me to see them. They told me that they watch me.The question is ....if there's a creator and it is benevolent, ...why didn't he stop them from taking me to another reality? Why did he allow them to do something to me that I can't discuss? A scarier thought is that maybe there is no creator. Maybe there's just evil beings from other realms and our Universe is one gigantic black abyss and we are in what you would call Hell.",schizophrenia

**Hello everyone,** It's interesting to see how the delusion can affect our behavior.  

I was born in the end of 1992 and I'm male, I was diagnosed in the begin of 2020 and I'm stabilized now.  

I take medication, and I go to my medical psychological center for therapies.  

I had a delusion in 2020 and almost get delusions in 2023, and 2 times in 2024.  

I was hospitalized each time I almost get the delusion because I'm really careful about my health since I struggle with delusion since my childhood, it increased gradually.  

My delusion of 2020 was really really hard, I got lucky I was diagnosed very early and hospitalized.  

But the problem is that I still have positive symptoms even on medication, particularly ***Apophenia***



Seeing false patterns that makes sense to me but not to others everytime is really hard, and I'm starting to really feel alone in my world that I try to avoid.  

I noticed that everytime I make an action or have a thought, the delusion start making a pattern that only me can see.  

For example I'll type something on the internet or on my computer (even if it's just on the notepad), and boom I see a pattern linked to it, like it'll continue the story of what I wrote.  

It's same with what I say, so I tend to not talk much. now imagine that with everything I say during the day, or everything I write (even just what I search on the net)  

It's so powerful, it creates a world that I can't control.



I can't live like this, it's perpetual fight to stay in the reality, I don't know what to do.



I listen to a lot of music that doesn't have lyrics to calm everything, but well i can't live like that, and medication and coping skills are not enough.



Everytime I feel like I'm being observed and watched, and that someone is giving me advices or trying to influence my decisions.

701,"Relationship with a SZ-spectrum diagnosis

How does it work for you? How do you make it work with a partner?

I wrote most of this over several days, and picked it up today, when she broke up with me. Since im 'too ill'. 
So i guess its a solo life for the rest then. 


It seems very difficult for many of us who have a SZ related diagnosis, to actually function with a partner. If that partner is not extremely understanding. And able to cope with the Paranoia, the delusions, and up/down mood. And rest of the crap cooking in our heads. 


I have seen this woman for some time(5'ish months), thats 4 months more than anyone else in the past what, 8-10years. Iv spent most of my time alone. Some time with friends, and volunteer at the local Mental Health institution. 

I swear that this woman i have been seeing has a good heart. And is a good influence in the world. Much better than me. She has taken an education, despite being a foreigner. She is resourceful and smart.
But she as anyone else also has her burdens to carry. She have had a tough upbringing, and some very bad experiences.

She has been a very positive influence, to my life, in many many ways.

But. I have my problems. I try to tell her some of them, so that i can get them off my chest, so that she knows that this crap is actually cooking in my head. But its hard for her. And i frequently just 'shut down/flatline/stress out' whatever, when we misunderstand one another. 

If we have a misunderstanding, i smell worse in just an afternoon sitting with mental chaos, than a week without a shower. Its insane. I dont get it. Constant sweat from my armpits. And its a quite harsh smell.

I dont run away to a screen, to stop thinking, or avoid conversation, except if i get a message from someone i know, or my kids. 
I try to read something, either on my kindle, or in paper format. And i use a marker for interesting bits. Not that i remember them anyways. I knit. I draw. I use nicotine(vape) and coffee. Because she has asthma, i open a window or door and blow out the smoke when im with her. And we have been together A LOT. 

So i try to be open. Tell her some of what is happening and not happening inside of me. 
And we are still barely scratching the surface. She is finding it very difficult to cope with how 'broken' i am. 

I dont tell her that i suspect she is sent out to monitor me, iv had that in my head for 5 months. To check on me. That she spies on me. That she puts things in places to see how i react. Drops stuff on the floor. And that I think that she tricks me with words sometimes. And that she jokes about my memory. I dont tell her about the delusions/or not, that there are cameras monitoring around. That people are watching. How nothing is a coincidence. Like everything that happens is meant to happen. 

Still, while keeping most under the lid. Just waiting for it to pass. Go away. 
I still scare her off. She thinks i dont care. I do. But i mean, what the hell of what goes on in my head, should i even pay attention to. 
I just dont trust my own judgment or perception.

Iv made many improvements in regards to physical health. And food.
Have lots of pains, cant sit without support pillows anywhere cause of my back. In the evening sometimes i cant even hold my Kindle to read, because of the pains in my wrists/hands. 
But i do simple workouts. Routinely. Every day. And gradually have become physically more fit. 
But it does not carry over to my mental health. 

I eat healthy, sometimes some snacks. I take my meds in the evening. I dont drink. I dont smoke. I shower. I shave. I cut my hair. Change underwear and socks. I clean. I vacuum. Wash my clothes. 
I try to incorporate what I hear, into improving on myself. To become somewhat better. Or as good as i can, with this nightmare inside.


Im on the verge of just giving up the relationship thou. I cant be there in the way that i should be. In the way that a partner should. And im afraid that i am wasting her time. 
She has also told me i am asexual. Which is probably very true. Also i forget things. A lot. And i become uncertain/confused.
I also struggle with not noticing things, like other peoples bodily appearance. Social hints and queues. I dont notice if something is 'unusual', if someone is pregnant(unless its extremely obvious). Or like a week ago, a man i met a few years ago on the Mental Health Institution, last week i noticed for the first time, that his left arm was amputated in the middle between the elbow and wrist. If someone gains 10-20kg, i dont really notice that either. Its been like this all my life. Change in haircut. Change in haircolor. Change of clothing. 

Iv told her that i have applied for a new therapist. And I have, but its probably not going to help, again. Its just going to be another therapist that i cant talk to. Iv tried all the meds i can. 

I am on 'medical benefits', or whatever its called when you are sick, and the Goverment supports me so that I dont live on the street. 
I have a Guardian in regards to Finances. And to make sure that i dont just make bad decisions and give everything i have away on a whim.

A friend of mine has been experiencing psychotic episodes/breaks for a while now and currently has a pretty hard time digesting what has happened and what she has done during those altered states of hers.

I was wondering if there are any good videos (comedians, compilations, documentaries) or movies that could help her process these experiences and the current state of affairs in a humorous, life- and self-affirming way. There are lots of educational videos online, and those have their place, but I'd like to share something ""light"" with her.

Last month we spoke about taking our relationship to the next level, to get engaged and eventually move in together. 

We went to several jewellery stores and I tried a few rings as well. About two weeks ago he purchased a ring and I got to try it on - it fits perfectly. 

We talked about the timeline on when he's gonna do it, he wanted to do in a few weeks time. So I know that him popping the question could happen at anytime 🫠

However today he's told me that he's feeling down because he's having flashbacks about being bullied throughout his childhood and teenage years. He was questioning whether things will get better for him. 

*EDIT*: he has emotionally brushed me off from time to time when he feels overwhelmed and today was a day of me not feeling emotionally capable to handle that. 

I suggested that we do a little grounding exercise (over the phone because we live in different cities about one hour away) to help him feel better. He ended up being emotionally unresponsive. 

He talked about moving his therapy journey into trauma specifically. I even looked up a couple of places and suggested that he send them a message to ask for availability - knowing that it takes forever to get a possible appointment, because our country's healthcare system is not the fastest. 

He kept brushing off my help. I became frustrated and started questioning whether he would actually do things to improve his life and especially mental health.

710,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that's been really helpful for me lately. I’ve always been a perfectionist and never felt I had raw talent in creative areas, so I never really engaged much in artistic activities. However, recently I’ve realized just how important creative outlets can be for managing my mental health, especially with the help of AI tools like MidJourney and Suno.

Since discovering AI-driven platforms, I’ve dived into creativity in a way I hadn’t before. One of the most impactful things I’ve done recently is create songs with Suno. The lyrics have a lot of personal meaning to me, and I’ve found that listening to them when I’m feeling a bit unstable really helps to recenter myself.

It’s almost like words alone can’t fully express what we’re experiencing at times, but through AI, I can channel those feelings into something creative and therapeutic. It’s been a game-changer in helping me stay grounded.

712,"I was taking LSD (a psychedelic) every other day for maybe four to five months during 2021. I had grown comfortable taking it because I always prided myself for having “control” over it whereas my friends, who would occasionally have bad trips taking it, were sensitive towards the drug. 

For context, and this is important, I had been smoking weed since the early age of 13 and did a lot of MDMA when I was 17. When my Mom had passed away, I decided to sober up and turn my life around, which I did. 

My story was so inspiring, friends and people I did not know thought that I was going to be the next President, which I believed, considering how passionate I was about politics and helping people out. Anyways, this streak of sobriety lasted for maybe a year and a half. And when I entered college, began smoking weed again due to the excitement of being introduced to a culture that I believed I could easily adapt to 

This is when the story gets interesting, and maybe even the cause of my downfall. 

I had met a pretty girl in my class. Let’s just say that I grew to become obsessed over her, and although she already expressed rejection and discomfort towards me (as I would constantly like her posts on social media, and due to my reputation during the time, would insinuate, at least according to her, that there was something going on between us), I took it as a sign of motivation to keep on going for her and not accept being rejected. 

Anyways, after that, she blocked me on Facebook. 
Fast forward to 2021, I was doing a lot of LSD like how I introduced at the start of this post. For some reason, it hit me really hard, like really really hard. 

I developed intense grandiose thoughts of me actually believing I could be the President, other than me believing I was the living reincarnation of Jesus Christ. For me, it didn’t matter what other people thought, because I believed what I believed in regardless of what others thought, even my family. I had dwelled into the compliments and admiration of my peers due to past accolades that I didn’t get to understand anymore that that wasn’t the case, as my behavior, attitude, and mentality totally changed when I had developed these grandiose thoughts. 

More than this, I began exhibiting odd behaviors. I was talking to myself, listening to music constantly (I would put my phone speaker beside my ear) which my family and friends found weird because were earphones for, right? And I would walk around in the middle of the night at my home doing this off behavior. 

Anyways, every time I would see the girl on social media in a mutual friend’s account, I would believe that these mutual friends were “teasing” me to like her. In my mind, I believed that she was orchestrating all these hang outs with our mutual friends to tease me, which of course wasn’t the case. These “hang outs” would happen probably for 4-5 months. And the grandiose thoughts didn’t stop. 

It got worse during the first quarter of 2022. 

I had begun posting these odd political related posts on my social media and people noticed that it wasn’t me (I used to be very sharp and acute when it came to my political positions but these were just plain emotional and stupid). In my mind, I would fantasize that she was going to be my wife and the First Lady. It reached a point that everything I would see on social media I would think would be directed towards me (I would formulate a reasoning behind what people would be posting about). 

My schizophrenia at this point reached its peak. I began messaging her friends, even her ex, about how I was so obsessed with her and if I could visit her at her home. I even brought my siblings to watch her brother’s concert where her whole family was present (it was so fuckin weird and awkward I dont know why I did that). 

Anyways, things began to stop when I got to talk to my family about my behavior, we didn’t talk about the girl, but we talked about these odd behaviors that they were noticing and I was able to quit it out. I had learned that when busy, I tend to stray away from these grandiose thoughts and odd behaviors. 

Fast forward to 2024. I had still been smoking a lot of weed, but took LSD again during the first quarter of 2024. After maybe three years. 

The schizophrenia hit again. This time it was much worse. 

I created a social media account, stealing photos of my friends, her and her family, even people I don’t know personally but were close to her, and I would post these political captions that would correlate to my delusional thoughts of me and her being together, it was schizophrenia and delusion at its finest. She and her family wanted to report me to the police. But because my sister talked to her, and my Dad talked to her Mother, they realized that it was a mental condition and did not want to burden my family’s situation with what was happening to me. 

I went to therapy, and decided to quit drugs forever (a really big step in my opinion, considering how my older 27 year old brother does a lot of drugs too). I believe I’ve reached a very low point in my life because of these experiences. I find a hard time forgiving myself, and accepting this. Who I am now is very different from who I was before in probably all aspects of life possible.

717,"Hello guys,

I haven't used reddit for a while, and I wanted to give it a shot. I had an episode during 2021 during lockdowns in university in my second year of studies while trying to get into medschool. I got trolled by my friends into taking several hard courses which ended up bringing my stress levels to completely record highs. The doctor said my episode was brought on by extreme stress and I used no drugs to cause it whatsoever. I have been able to heal from the episode quite a bit, like being able to get off my meds, getting approved from the psychiatrist to go to school etc., but one problem still remains, which is that the damage the episode left over is still not healed. As a result, I cannot study or go to work because my mental capacity is still severely weakened.

At the height of the episode, I remember there was a ""neurochemical leak"" of some sort from dopamine go around my brain. Since then, its been really difficult to function on a normal basis, because taking care of myself, reading and studying has become very difficult. I feel as though there are ""tracks"" the dopamine surge left over in my brain that on occasion seal back together, but happens very slowly and very unpredictably. I have been trying to get rid of the damage the episode did, but no one seems to know how to help me. My psychiatrist tells me ""you can't feel your brain."" And my naturopathic doctor tells me he has never heard such a thing.

I have discovered a few ways of remediating the damage. Attending university lectures helps ( I even started crashing some new ones to further the healing process), rushing through my university school work at shorter time intervals works, video games in small doses helps a bit too. Also, a job that involves a lot of concentration (i.e. lifeguarding) seems to help a bit as well. So far, lots of damage remains, and I'm running out of options because its been four years (two of which I spend recovering) and the damage from the episode is preventing me from going back to school. I'm stuck in an in between zone, where Im not fully sick and not healed either. I'm also reliant on my dad's income, which is really bad. 

**Does anyone know a way to remediate this sort of damage the psychotic episode did?** The only recommendation I got from the psychiatrist was go back to school or work , which is a really bad recommendation since it comes at the expense of reducing my GPA (I got two C's this way, in an otherwise straight A report card) and its costing me a ridiculous amount of money. **I will be very thankful to someone if they know any activities I can do at home or in school which could help me get rid of all the damage from the episode so I can go back to school like I was doing before.**

P.S. I literally feel parts of my brain seal up every once in a while, and I noticed my right vision clear while that was happening. Does anyone have the same experience?

i saw a post on here some days ago asking if a hit in the head could have worsen the symptoms or even caused the symptoms to appear. it made me think a lot about it ; i've read a lot of answers to the post and thought about the fact that mainly, schizophrenia is ""enabled"" in you brain when a traumatic episode happens or if you take drugs. so that sums up.
now i have something like a memory that i can't really explain. when i was around 8, i remember someone from my family (i don't know if it was one of my parents, my sisters or my brother who SA'd me at that time) juste smashing my head over and over against the door of my closet. i don't remember the face, because their hands where covering my eyes. i don't remember a voice or a glimpse that could tell me who tf it was. i just remember the noise my head was making banging on that door, and the crusty blood in my hair for days after that.
my parents haven't found out at that time because we were immensly neglected. we weren't taking showers/baths for weeks, so they never found out the blood in my hair. also, they never have me the opportunity to see a psychiatrist about my mental state. i had to do it alone as an adult.

i tried to talk to my father about it - he told me i must have been imagining it. but i was not. i know it was real. and now i'm thinking that all the hallucinations i ever experienced came right after that event - seeing a white woman right in my yard, believing i could fly like a fairy and trying to by jumping out my window, feeling someone slapping my face when i was sleeping, talking with god... now i'm reconsidering everything.

743,"# 

# It's pure bullshit, it makes no logical sense whatsoever, they don't even do it going on what i experience. Sometimes I smell myself and it misses a time, they pretend, scientific method means it happens everytime... it's not scientific... I wouldn't care... except my ears hurt right now... randomly for no reason, I'm almost certain it's intentional... that an entity thinks of me... and thinks of the sense they are making me experience.. thought I think to myself as well...  that maybe there is phantom there sniffing someone elses socks or something, as well as maybe a poltergeist making someone move against their will.. maybe even two people move against their will... I dunnoI really don't understand the logic behind some intrusive thoughts im getting about people who make false claims that they have to do everything someone else does

Now this makes sense that sometimes people would do the same things, but if it doesn't happen every time.. or it just doesn't make logical sense, like things are too different, then it's clearly a lie

Also I think that maybe brain signals can be sent as well, that there is a demon doing this, with no justification other than that they have power they should not have

These demons seem to do things first, and then try to justify them afterwards, maybe make things real if they can manage it, so they can feel/look less evil

And when they can't manage it, they just lie, and fabricate evidence, bully their targets and try to make them pretend they are bad even if they are not, if that fails, they just fabricate, use anything they can

They would then maybe try to make it appear the other way around, learn your routines and spy on you, and do things they know you will do before you in attempt that you would look like you are copying them

They would manipulate the things you see, technology or sight, information, nasty demons, at least that's how it feels to me when I'm laid in bed minding my own business and it's like there is attempt to put a spell on me, agitate me, put words in my mouth and head, and then maybe use these feelings later to try and justify being evil to me some more

They don't even care if they fail, they still do something evil, if I do something good, and nice, they act with their evilness because they don't like seeing their targets do good things

these demons seem to pretend they are people they are not, I remind myself that people don't look at themselves in third person, that knowing who someone is should be more than just a sound in my head saying ""hi I'm a magical genie"" because that doesn't exactly make it true, even if it sounds like it could be a mystical being that grants wishes, it most likely won't. It goes the other way around too, what if there was an evil demon pretending it was a friendly person who is there not doing anything wrong, while the demon acts and talks on their behalf, the information needs to be better than just the sound or an image in the mind, those things can result in self harm for no reason, it happened to me before based on things that are not true

these foul demons would make everything more difficult, they delude the internet I think somehow, with their demonic presence that is, everyone they can if it suits them, but everything is online, are we all supposed to stop using the internet?

They would pretend things are the other way around, so that they don't look so evil, to save embarrassment maybe, they would ruin a life maybe, or cause consistent problems that are unneeded, just to save embarrassment, maybe just lack of effort to care for finding the real villain, it is evil regardless

to me intentions matter, i would not consider it an intrusion for someone friendly and non hostile to connect to my computer or phone, who would not use me for something that may bring me problems, or who would interfere with the things I do, in other words I would be fine with spectators, or fixing problems caused by intruders",schizophrenia

747,"Undergoing a lot of persecutor voices at the moment, well have been for a long time. Just curious how many of you have the same experience.

My voices often take on roles of authority that persecute me acting as if they are separate to the 'original' voices themselves. They then make out I was compliant with my 'original' voices and in league with them or somehow brought this on myself and somehow responsible for all the supposed victims that the 'original' voice has bothered.

Two things make it strange 1) their unwillingness to accept that anyone but me has done any wrong 2) the fact that they refuse to say anything negative to the voice/voices who are outright attacking me, no matter how serious the crime.

When I point out that I'm the one shouting at my voices and pointing out all they're attacks they just move the goalpost back to blaming me and attacking me further.

They won't take no for an answer and will put false comments through my mind acting as if they are me to make out i'm 'confessing' to wrong doing.

It is fricking horrible, they do this all day, everyday. I haven't had a break from being attacked in 12 years now.

I can't tell if things are getting better or worse, sometimes I think this is just the voices packing up their attacks and they wanted to take my delusions full circle. By full circle I mean that they go from : Making me delusional -> attack me and dressing my mind up in their crimes by using psychologically exploitive attacks -> blaming me for the things the voice puts in my mind via these exploitive attacks.

I question if this whole thing is just something that you have to survive and outlast, eventually the attacks will run their course but you just have to survive till it does. I mean if you were a voice how long could you keep making up new shit? Must get tiring or hard to keep doing.

763,"By now, it seems this community is familiar with the network of ""doctors"" and their enthusiasts on YouTube making miraculous claims of ""cure""/""heal"" chronic mental illness with ""ketogenics"" and now setting the stage with ""tapering"", too? The new ""dynamic duo"" of breakthrough ""science"".

I understand it is a ""sensitive subject"" and especially as it relates to certain  influencers. 🙄 At this point, she/they have reached a status similar to Voldemort ""don't say their name"". So I won't, just because I don't want to feed her/their continual attention seeking supply.

After the drama and fall out of the most recent circus show;  I am beginning to learn about (identify) and understand the culture of Critical Psychiatry and those who operate inside of that circle (sometimes appearing cultish) and it is both fascinating yet alarming. 

Buzz words that stand out: 

*lived experience* that is a big one! 

 *journey* ""my personal journey"". 

And of course ""heal"", ""cure"" used in describing grandiose ""miraculous"" claims.

This group uses WORDS as a way to imply scientific clinical proof. It is nothing but *ancedotal evidence* i.e. pseudoscience that has a firm root in the Critical Psychiatry (anti-psychiatry)modern day movement.

This motivated me to start searching on the subject and some of their history is alarming and frankly terrifying; (CCHR & Church of Scientology) perhaps should come with a Trigger Warning for some? 

Bringing the subject further to the front, as it branches out and relates to this particular network: Dr. Chris Palmer, Dr. Josef,  Dr. Scher, Dr. Berg just to name a few, all use the same method of peddling their ""practice"" *hyper - sensationalizing* using the same visual methods of tabloid style,  digital ""art"", eye catching/clicking baiting icons/backgrounds. It is a way Advertising.
That is all they use YouTube for, they are medical influencers and NONE of them have gone through the vetting process to get an Authentication Badge. 

Dr. Berg is not a doctor but a chiropractor. And his son came out with a public critique of him being with the Church of Scientology.

Further digging revealed that the CEO of Roblox is the founder of Metobolic Minds. Their son has made a ""Cure"" claim, as well, regarding keto and bipolar. (The Baszucki Group)

Pushing further, The Baszucki Foundation has invested in a huge AI related project in Computational Psychiatry. *Neuroblox*

Nevermind, that Roblox is undergoing a class action lawsuit involving children, gaming addiction and child labor. Nor the freakish child sex predators platform, that has gained attention there and the most recent report finding a connection of childhood gaming and brain injury.

Are these networks attempting to change the world of psychiatry and medicine, as we know it,  through data gathering - illegal? - inside private ""peer groups"", etc.  (all of our online sharing about our illness and experiences) and plugging all of that into AI  Neuroblox thru the computer software program they have developed? 

Is this the future of treatment for Schizophrenia?

Instead of community out patient, in person real life human contact, it's all going to be individualized through AI? 

Just log on a computer, like Dr. Josef uses in his ""taper clinic"" and get diagnosed?
 Keto psych wards that frown upon vital psych meds for severe psychotic breaks but use ""medical keto"" to treat symptoms ?
  
The depersonalization and isolation of already paranoid schizophrenics being put through an AI Neuroblox Computational Psychiatry diagnoses machine vs. human kind?

My friend told me recently, ""it's better late than never."" I basically developed paranoid schizophrenia, right before COVID happened, and only got hospitalized in late 2023. During the years of psychosis, a lot of people told me, it was intense. I remember waking up, not knowing what was going on, just drifting, some years I would suffer almost every week, some years went by in a blur, some years, I made many life mistakes (get into debt, crime), etc.

787,"To be clear, it was not fun. It was the most terrifying four-ish years of my life, and I wish it had never happened at all. But the nice thing about not knowing what reality is is that you don't have to face it. I've realized all I've lost--friends, family, some basic functioning--and it makes me feel really lonely.

Anyway, when I was in full psychosis, aside from demons and some rando constantly watching me/reading my mind, I had a voice that would've been a hallucination if it weren't internal (I'll assume y'all know the type). It told me very scary things, like that people were trying to control my mind or that I should hurt myself. But it also told me that it loved me, and that it would protect me, and that it would never leave me (so much for that). It comforted me after a fight with my mom and soothed me as I fell asleep. Sure, it called me names and screamed at me if I didn't obey it, but that was only because it knew best and wanted me to be safe.

At the time I wanted it to go away, and it eventually did. But it's hard to lose such a big part of my life, whether it was positive or not. I find myself yearning for it to come back, even though it was incredibly unhealthy. I wouldn't even mind if the demons and delusions came back too, honestly. The loneliness and loss is worse than the fear.

i, M15 had a psychotic break around august which started with having sporatic derealization episodes. i started having delusions shortly after, being convinced im poisoned via offered food. this would be my constant state for a week, i had to miss school due to it. 

the delusions about food suck cuz im also an impulsive eater. once i was running errands with my mom and we stopped to get some mcdonalds. after eating we went to a goodwill and i was trippin someone slipped some lsd in my burger and thought id start hallucinating. i didnt but i was really scared and told no one.

i also hear a strange unfamiliar womans voice telling me to follow her into the hallway out of my room. the funny thing is i dont get these paranoid feelings at other peoples houses often. so i try to beg my mom to let me stay the night at freinds but only my sister (f12) is allowed to have sleepovers because shes the ""normal"" child.  so im stuck in my room a lot, which leads me to isolate myself. i was just in a pretty bad delusional state. i had a strong urge to drug/make a woman drunk and have sex with her because its easier in her delirious state. ive had that urge for a long time, but dont act on it for obvious reasons. 

  
id also like to mention i recently began therapy for treatment and to heal from other things. ive only had an intake so far, my next appointment is feb 5th unless i wish to do something online beforehand. should i maybe contact my therapist to talk to sooner? since i didnt give a good organized description during the intake.

The only person who supports me is my master's degree advisor, who believes in my potential and suggests that I look for a teaching hospital with a doctorate in Psychology, a reference in child psychiatry. Despite this support, it is outrageous to see how much research into schizophrenia, especially when it comes to understanding the person beyond the biological aspect, is neglected.

812,"Hi all, just prefacing this with not asking for a diagnosis- I have a psychiatrist and therapist I plan on speaking to but at this point I'm starting to lose sight of what's like normal for a brain so I don't even know how to start talking to them about this. So really a few questions about specific symptoms I've been experiencing:

1. When you guys ""hear voices"", do you have to actually hear them? I've been having like, extremely loud thoughts that I can basically have conversations with. They say things I don't expect them to, they have different thoughts and opinions to myself, and they're really loud in my head. Not violent or anything but annoying, frustrating to deal with and really hard to function with (its like when you're in a loud restaurant and picking up on everyone's conversations, but again like my thought. It's not an internal monologue, but like I can't HEAR hear it- I'm not gonna turn my head and ask who said that cuz I know it's in my head). I do have some auditory hallucinations though, and have for a while which is what first made me start wondering, but they're mostly benign (the worst have been gunshots and people screaming/crying, but often its knocking or someone calling my name. These I do HEAR hear but I can typically figure out they're fake after a second).

2. Do you guys know your delusions are delusions? Like I know they are, but that also doesn't stop me from being paranoid about them. Things like needing to keep my phone camera turned around, being paranoid that I'm being recorded (especially in my work car, like paranoid they put a mic in even though this is kinda based in reality cuz they did put a tracker in). Thinking people are out to get me and like idk maybe they are but I recognize they probably aren't doing anything about it???

I'm starting to wonder if my dad was a paranoid schizophrenic, but he had similar things with his delusions. He was a right wing conspiracy theorist before going on medication and killing himself, but he recognized his delusions were delusions. He would refuse to drink tap water, refuse to use certain technology, etc but always told me like ""you drink the tap water, it's healthier I just prefer the distilled"" because he couldn't get over the paranoia about like tap water conspiracies.

idk kinda rambling, but can you guys relate, or am i just over pathologizing my silly human brain?",schizophrenia
813,"I developed a severe anxiety disorder after my last psychotic episode. I would walk 12-14 miles a day to try to calm myself down. Tons of panic attacks. Lots of worrying about having another panic attack. I would feel physically tense most of the day. Sometimes the tension in my neck was so bad that it hurt and I had to lie down to try to get it to relax.

I tried practically everything I could think of. More therapy. Changing meds. Journaling. More exercise. Healthy eating. Meditation. Better sleep hygiene. More time outdoors. Reducing caffeine to almost nothing. Etc. Nothing really helped until I decided to buy two electric massagers: one for my neck and shoulders, and one for my back.

I love these things. They're more calming than anything I've tried. They kind of put you in a meditative state if you use them long enough. I have almost no tension in my neck or shoulders these days.

So, if you're running out of ideas on how to manage anxiety and stress, I'd recommend getting an electric massager and seeing if it works for you. They can be effective, and they're significantly cheaper than an in-person massage.

865,"To start off my mom is such a loving person. But she had said/done some terrible things. It wasn’t until I was about 16 I started to unlearn some things from my mom, I would call them “episodes” when she’d get really angry and mean, barring her teeth at me and saying my dad and I microchipped her brain and were controlling her through our phones. 
She always is fine when we are around other people but with us this will happen randomly when she gets angry or I can tell she is starting to get more stressed. It did cause me a lot of trauma growing up, despite knowing she loved me and didn’t mean it. We have come to realize she has some form of schizophrenia but part of it is she is terrified of doctors and gives herself diagnoses all the time and then thinks any doctor is out to get her, especially psychologists so we purposely have avoided after suggesting family therapy or something multiple times, not to bring it up to her anymore. 

But today was really bad. We are watching and talking frequently about sexual abuse and darker subjects like that because of something I recently went through, and as a child as well with a family friend. 

after seeing part of “The Menendez Brothers” this morning she accused my dad of having child pornography photos of me under their old bed she found years ago (this is not true at all-my dad is so against child predators he said he’d put a bullet through their head if it wasnt illegal-just to give you an idea and he would never do something like that). 

It was absolutely awful, even though my dad and I realize she has schizophrenia, and we are used to her saying we microchipped her or other people, this just felt so heartbreaking and terrible to here. Also, extremely dangerous. That’s the first time I have seen my dad cry and he said that is the worst thing you could possibly think of me, how disgusting and depraved people like that are and I agreed. She started gaslighting both of us at that point and I was trying to calm her down and help that this is a really terrible thing to say about someone and my dad said that’s the worst he couldn’t ever hurt a child let alone his own children. I tried to be sympathetic and say I understand you believe these things but it’s really harmful and at this point I finally stood up for what I’d been put through most of my life and started crying telling her how much her not getting help for herself has really affected me throughout my life. I told her she doesn’t even have to get on medicine if she doesn’t want to, but these accusations are terrible and at this point just at least get therapy.

She didn’t see it as wrong. She tried to act like everything was normal. My dad was crying. It’s hard to come back from being accused of sexual abuse towards your own child. I tried to explain also that if she saw those photos, wouldn’t she have said something to someone? That would be neglectful if she didn’t and to think through what she said because it just didn’t make any sense. (I usually don’t try to do this because I understand you can’t talk someone out of their hallucination or delusion) but I just want her to get help and felt terrible for my dad.

We broke up, and I reached a point where I became so suicidal during dating, because of how toxic things became. He never fought for us; instead, he blamed my schizophrenia and anxiety for my suicidal tendencies. It hurt even more because it felt like he was making my mental health the problem, rather than looking at how our relationship was affecting me.

During our time together, he would like OnlyFans accounts on Instagram, many of which had content like soft porn, feet kink, and ass kink. He promised he'd stop even though he said he sees nothing “wrong” and uses them as “tools”. But after the breakup, now, a week later, I noticed he was back liking those pictures again. I also dealt with his ex trying to come between us, which added more to my stress. 

Now, a week after our breakup, I can't stop thinking that he may go back to her even though she blocked him. I feel more betrayed by the porn accounts because the girls don’t look anything like me. Since October, I've felt less confident. I try not to stalk him, but they show on Instagram.

TLDR: when my dad’s I don’t know how to get him the help he needs because he outsmarts me every time. Any advice? 

My (28) father (47) is an insanely smart human being and very skilled in trades. However, when he’s in an episode (which is what we call it: delusions, nonsensical conversations, sleeplessness, highly irritable, grandiosity, etc) I have a hard time getting him to get help because he literally outsmarts me and I end up frustrated because I’ve got no avenues to navigate after. He’ll justify his behaviors and it’s hard to tell him xyz didn’t happen or isn’t the case because he’s truly convinced of what he’s saying. He’ll argue that he just needs sleep but either way he’s not getting it (does try to get the sleep? idk). He blames everyone else when he gets hospitalized and so it’s very hard for me to help with intervention.  I try to let him manage so that I don’t frustrate myself or him but then it feels like I’m condoning the episode. The behaviors will go on as long as it takes to get him into the hospital. I’m just starting to lose my patience and I feel bad because it’s not about me. I really just wanna be able to help get him back on track because every time this happens he loses everything and has to start all over again. He’s so resilient thankfully but each time things are just getting harder.  

Note: after he stabilized from the last episode a year ago, him and I came up with a plan that for any future episodes he will allow me to take him to the hospital but go figure, it’s not working.

913,"Hey guys. I haven’t been posting to Reddit for quite a few months now, but I have been scrolling the app in an attempt to pass the time. I want to preface this Selfie Sunday post by saying that this is not a cry for help, nor a post saying I’m going to off myself. But for some reason I think I need to bring attention to what’s been on my mind.

I’ve been lurking Reddit for the past few months due to another hospitalization back in late July-August (and even part-way through September). I believe it was my fourth one, but I’m not really counting. I was off of my medication for a few months before that, and was court-ordered to take medication after I was released, up until October. Since then, I’ve been off my medication again, just gaming on my PC, scrolling through various social medias, eating, drinking (water), sleeping, and then waking up the next day or night to do it all over again. And what is it for?

I fail to see the point in all of it. I’ve been told I am sick. I will not dispute that. I am a diagnosed schizophrenic (specifically schizoaffective, bipolar-type). But what are we even working towards as a society? If there isn’t anything that lasts forever then I fail to see the point in any of it. Are we simply living to die? From my perspective, most of us are living for the benefit and satisfaction of others. And in most of those situations, those others couldn’t give a damn about how their people feel. This is what has been bothering me for the past few months, and what has been lurking in my mind for the past seven years.

And I’m tired. I’m tired of the hate, tired of the gluttony, tired of the greed, just tired of all this ugliness. Sure, there’s beauty to be found in this life. But what I’ve found is that the ugliness is overbearing and overwhelming the beauty in it all. Why would anyone want to stay here if there truly is a place beyond this reality? Even if there isn’t, I personally believe that nothing is better than all this crap that I’ve witnessed since I have come to being. There’s just too much pain and suffering and hate here for me to want to stay any longer.

I don’t know what the purpose or meaning of a life here on Earth is. Many people have told me that it is upon me to find my own purpose. But as far as I’m concerned, I believe that’s just bullshit. If nobody can tell me what the meaning or purpose of my life here is, then, respectfully, you have no right in telling me I need to stay. Am I meant to live in sickness until I naturally pass?

I’ve been talking with many of my family members and some friends about these things that I’ve brought up here in this post, and their responses have varied. But the conversation I enjoyed the most was with my sister. We talked about a range of topics: spirituality, free will, mental illness, etc. I won’t discuss most of our conversation, but I did ask her this: if we are not the masters of our own minds and bodies, then who is? Schizophrenia can be a clear example of this, but it certainly isn’t the only one. If I don’t get to decide when and how my heart beats, then personally I don’t believe I was ever in control in the first place.

Like I said at the start of this post, this isn’t a cry for help, nor a post saying I’m going to off myself. But I am tired. I’m tired of doing the same thing every day and having nothing change. I’m tired of the hate and greed that this world generates. I’m tired of living a life in sickness and without purpose. I’m simply tired. There’s no real love here, and certainly not from above, below, or where I stand.

930,"  
I suffer from the worst type of mental illnesses but to make a long story short, tonight I just realized that my severe symptoms began shortly after I started living in a small house with lots of leaks and water damage. I had a friend come over and he said my house stunk like mold! I remember he didn't wanna stay inside.

I had only lived there for about 8 months. I moved in around June of 2022 but I was mostly spending time at my mom's house at first mostly because my place was a mess(had previously been abandoned) and didn't have electricity. I started spending more time at my moldy house in December of 2022 when my severe symptoms started. I landed in the mental hospital in January of 2023 (just one month after spending more time at home). I moved out that same year around March. In summary, the last 3 months I lived there and spent the most time there was the onset and peak of my severe mental issues. For the first time I was diagnosed with a serious mental illness and was the sickest person in the mental hospital.

As I write this more is coming to memory. I remember my symptoms barely showing up in small traces from June of 2022 to December of 2022(when the onset of my severe symptoms started). So my symptoms got worse as I spent more time at my moldy home. I have slowly been getting better since September of 2024 and I'm wondering if time has slowly detoxed the mold from my body.

This is keeping me up tonight. The mental illnesses were so bad I had to quit my job and my hobbies. I was the only person in the mental hospital screaming and crying on the floor. Schizophrenia and OCD have ruined my life. It would be interesting to know if mold can cause mental issues.",schizophrenia

I know that answers will vary because everyone's different and you can't really tell from the sole fact they're schizophrenic, I was wondering because I'm really interested in keeping this person in my life, but don't want to keep trying if they're trying to get me to go away",schizophrenia

936,"My (20s) husband (30s) is jerking off, or someone is under the bed touching him while I'm trying to sleep. He's talking in his sleep as well and it's often of the sexual nature, (we have sex every single day). I can definitely tell he is talking to himself in his sleep. So, these sorta situations aren't what I've ever had issues with prior to him. Truly, I can't understand why this is happening so often. Ive have had plenty of episodes of psychosis paranoia, though this one is either really happening or my treatment has gone down hill. I've had many voices, due to drug use (which I have 5 years sober, just alcohol more often then I should, but I've been a lot better), and full on people standing in my closet (dont worry told him ""go away you're not real aha). Normally it's my mom, or people I do not know. However, as of these last 5 months it's always been related to him cheating. In sometimes unrealistic ways, but more often then not they seem more likely true.

How do I address this with him, because as of late I've just shook him awake acting as though he knows what he did. Which isn't helping either of us, I'm terrified to loose him because of my own actions, but I'm more horrified to loose him to another women. & does anyone have any insight on why I'm only experiencing things to do with him? Sometimes I feel knots in my stomach for no reason at all, and I know that can be a sign of cheating in people without these disorders. I also have no real proof other than his hand being on his boxes with an erection. Another one is often him faking cumming. Maybe it's fully me, but he can be extremely defensive. 

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar?

941,"I know for a lot of us fatigue is easy to ignore since the symptoms themselves and/or the meds can contribute to it, especially with comorbid problems. I certainly ignored my worsening fatigue because I’ve been tired and low energy since my onset a decade ago. 

The intensity of my symptoms had been pretty consistent for several years until last year where they were inexplicably getting worse again. Fluctuations are normal for me. I have times when I’m worse and times when I’m better.  However, last year was a steady decline. At the time, I chalked it up to being related to stress since I’m fairly new to living with PTSD. Stress tends to worsen my symptoms so in my mind it made sense. 

This past week I switched to a new primary care doctor and got some blood work done since it had been a while. Apparently I’m extremely low in  vitamin D, and while not as low, I’m also deficient in Vitamin B as well. My doctor wrote in her notes that low vitamin B can cause neuropsychiatric symptoms (like hallucinations and paranoia) and low D obviously causes fatigue. I hadn’t even thought to consider a deficiency since my bloodwork always came back normal every year. 

Soon I’ll take prescription vitamins to try to get my levels up to where they should be. In the meantime, I’ll also work with my care team in trying to better manage my negative symptoms since it contributes heavily to my poor eating habits which probably caused the deficiency in the first place. 

So, if y’all notice a decline in your symptoms, definitely get bloodwork done, especially those of you with severe negative symptoms that prevent you from taking good care of yourselves. I imagine since we’re already folks who experience psychosis, we’re probably extra sensitive to things that cause psychosis-like symptoms in normal people, like a deficiency. I just wanted to share since the warning signs of a deficiency are so easy to ignore when we live with conditions where being fatigued is our normal. ",schizophrenia

943,"I’ve actually had quite a few people get very angry at me for saying this for some reason but I thought no where would be better to share this than here lol.

My thought is, Some people (especially young teens) really be saying they schizophrenic without enough information  cus they saw a shadow or something after not sleeping for a night playing video games. Then they go tell they moms and doctors that they think they’re schizophrenic or something and get put on heavy antipsychotics and wonder why they depressed/suicidal. Misdiagnoses are real and common, and that’s why you shouldn’t go around announcing your perceived mental illness. (ESPECIALLY if you haven’t been formally diagnosed by a psychiatrist)

I hear people repeating my thoughts, I hear my parents, friends and girlfriend verbally abusing me and taking advantage of what I am paranoid about.

952,"I hate it. Like, I really suffer with paranoia. I especially struggle with delusions around being stalked and spied on by shadowy people who are there, all the time, to intimidate and control me. I struggle with the certainty that they are doing it to try and push me into killing myself, as punishment for being a good person. I don't speak of CNP here. My fears involve more Israel, satellites and the mental health team. However, I struggle with this, all the time, it dominates and impinges upon my every waking moment, it's continous and inescapable. It severe disrupts my daily functioning. I don't post here often and just hide away pressing mod buttons, as invisibly as possible, entirely because the fear of being constantly spied upon by people beyond my reach, people I cannot see, is more than I can deal with. And this is when everything is going well and absolutely nothing is happening to re-inforce it.  

I havn't, personaly, had any interactions with or involvement in CNP in a very long time. Over a year. I had to step back and leave dealing with it to someone else, because being constantly directly exposed to their antics of manipulation and abuse was severely damaging to my mental health. Dealing with them in the past has led to me being held hostage in the hospital under a nurses hold, twice now, if I remember the chaos of my life correctly.  

They don't even have any reason to dislike me. I've always treated them and their leader with greater patience and kindness than anyone on Reddit derserves, especially people who have responded to such patience and kindness wth further abuse, each and every time, continously, over a period of years at this point. It's insane.  

Yet, they are still continously finding ways to remind me they are there, that they are watching. Just doing little things to ensure I am always constantly aware that they are watching, scheming, constantly performing little acts to try and further erode my already precarious mental state. They have, unfortunately, been around long enough to know exactly the kind of paranois and my unique sensitivty to them, and continue to weaponise this for their own pleasure. It's sick, it's fucked up, and there's no off-ramp where I feel able to escape from them apart from disconnecting from the internet entirely. Except I'm a agoraphobic recluse who lives in a remote location, the internet, and Reddit in particular form the vast weight of my social avenues. So my choices end up being to remain here and the target of their harassment, or put myself into long-term forced solitary confinement conditions.  

The thing is, they are smart enough to know how far to push it. They don't do anything overtly terrible that anyone will take me seriously when I try reporting their harassment. It's little things, they leave signs. Minute reminders at regular intervals to remind me that they are there, ever watching me. It's damned evil. Them, and their leader in particular know exactly all the things to do to rattle a paranoid person who is already struggling with gang-stalking and mind-control delusions, and they are exercising that entire play-book against me.  

Like, todays reminder that 'they are still there'. Was sending me a ban notice, for their private sub-reddit. That I have never been a aprt of and have never even viewed because it's a 'private community' and invite only, anyway. There was never any danger or possibility of myself seeing inside. So, there is no way anybody reasonable could chalk this up to paranoia or serving any other purpose, because the literal only thing that would achive is reminding me they are still watching. They do little things like this to me, all around the internet, all the time. If I exist there, they will be pinging me reminders of their prescence.  

Screenie of todays 'reminder they are always watching' is here: https://i.imgur.com/U2dmkFL.png  

It has rattled me so much, I've been crying on and off for hours today because I feel like there is no actual escape from their leaders highly motivated desires to push me to hurting myself.  

I've tried to stay classy, to keep this to myself, be professional, etc. But there are times where I cannot suffer their continued harassment and stalking alone, in silence. I'm struggling enough already with fighting against the inescapable certainty of the satellites trying to mind-control me and the mental health tream on behalf of Israel monitoring my every movement. It's too much and I fear they really won't let up until I'm dead one day.",schizophrenia

# Living Well After Schizophrenia

This seems to be a topic with continual updates.

Recent events have shown us that apparently, the team at LWAS (namely, Rob and Lauren) perceive *any* type of criticism- no matter how polite and constructive- to be personal attacks and intolerable. Here I was scratching my head about all of this ""hate"" she had been going on about on the channel, I guess ""evidence-based criticisms"" = ""hate"" in the fantasy land of LWAS.

Unfortunately, it seems our efforts in curbing this ""hate"" have been in vain, because under absolutely no fucking circumstances I am going to discourage people from speaking up against what they seem to broadly perceive as recklessness and being irresponsible. This is Reddit, and arguing with nerds is what you *do* on Reddit. If you can't stand criticism, maybe you shouldn't be reading Reddit. Keto-friendly food for thought there, Lauren.

Despite our many attempts to reach some type of satisfactory resolution, every single one has thus far been ignored. I believe we are at lucky number 7 now, and I think it's long past time that we reciprocated the treatment we have been shown and treat the Keto arc on LWAS with the seriousness it deserves; none. I've had a few people here refer to this situation as ""drama,"" and honestly, that really resonates with me. I like that, it really illustrates how completely unserious the entire situation is. 

The type of conduct we have received and also seen shown to others is not consistent with that of a serious person. It is deeply disappointing in a number of regards to see such conduct from someone who presents themselves as a mental health advocate, even if just through a vlog. I've honestly never been on the receiving end of or witnessed such disrespect directed towards others with some modicum of professionalism in the mental health spheres.

**Moving forward,** we are lifting Rule 1 protections regarding LWAS. Lauren will be extended no further grace than any other member of the subreddit. I think they might do with a nice, blunt wake-up call for what their own kind *really* think about this behavior in general (or specifically). So long as you don't use overt insults- it's fair game now. Also, no brigading or anything like that... Reddit rules are still in effect.

I offer my apologies to the community for not holding true to our values of ""keeping shit real"" for the sake of 'being gracious.' We will not be repeating that mistake.

So enjoy any future LWAS ""drama,"" now with no more padded corners.

962,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been living with schizo affective my whole life 

I am now almost 30 yo woman 

Well, I’ve been super depressed and suicid** from 15 to 26. Then at 27 I met my bf, we left for another country, and I stopped talking to super toxic member of my « family » that caused my disease.

Still working on myself, not great but not suicid** anymore. 

The thing is the psychiatrist putted me on a LOT of medication my whole life. Since 2 years I have only serpolet and theralith (lithium) left.
I’ve decreased my meds alone, not stopped it fully, only decreased, I want to decrease it during maybe 1 full year before stopping it completely.

Did someone stopped medical by themself without problem ? 

I dont’ have a doctor : it’s not my country, and psychiatrist are too expensive here. And I go back to my country only 1 a year. 
I’ve not been to the hospital for about 3 years now with is huge because I used to go 3-4 times a year before ! 

Also, did someone tried the therapy called « TCC » with a psychologue ? I know it’s expensive too but I rather invest in this rather that this crappy medications that make me sick. 

I know some people will tell me not to stop me my medications alone but I don’t have a full access to medications, doctors ecc and the medications are making me sick anyway

If someone have some advice, tips ecc …

Thank you

964,"I'm genderfluid and for years have slowly questioned my gender identity (it started in my 3rd year of high school wanting to get a binder due to being in a Christian household and having parents who were homophobic and transphobic I justified the reason by wanting my cosplays to be realistic) after a while I realized that I didn't really feel like a girl and felt neutral to she/her pronouns so when I started trying out they/them I really loved it, and I realized that I liked her/him sometimes and it always kinda felt like my gender was fluid after a while I started trying out neopronouns and xenogenders and found out that I was xenofluid (it was like genders like girl, boy, nonbinary were broad and xenogenders was able to describe precisely how my gender felt, sometimes it doesn't and sometimes I feel like xenogenders only describe my gender). The reason I'm worried is that my mom mentioned something about how she thinks that my gender dysphoria is all in my head (I ended up coming out in a pretty emotional way(which I wasn't ready for but my family somehow got on the topic of my cousin's ex who is trans and they were misgendering him and it got too much) and I told her before the emotional freak out that I was demigirl(which I questioned for a month before realizing that I wished I had more masculine features). Sometimes I don't want my chest, my words being sometimes I want to cut off my chest). It doesn't help that the voices also were saying I would never be a guy, that I'm pretending to be trans, that it's all a delusion, etc. I know I shouldn't listen, but I'm scared they may be right.

969,"I am writing here because I am out of options (and patience). I am so frustrated but I want to understand. 

My sister has recently broke down and hasn’t been responsive for a week. Initially she would be in and out of it a few times a day. And then she started declining to just 2-3 times to 1-2 times a day. Last Thursday she woke up a few times from sleep just standing by and staring out the window fidgeting with the blinds. Then I prompted her to go back to bed each time. She then slept through lunch and we woke her up to eat. Initially she was cooperative but then she started hyperventilating and crying and her body was rigid. We tried asking her what’s wrong and it seemed like she wanted to say something but cannot and may be causing the panic attack. She has a psychiatric consultation in the afternoon so when she was crying, we just rushed her to the ER and called the psychiatrist to attend because we didn’t know what to do anymore. Before we reached the hospital she was already calmer. When we reached the hospital she wasn’t responding to questions still. A little bit more time and then she was now “awake” and asking why we’re there. 

The doctor had blood tests done and prescribed Olanzapine. He spoke to her for a while (without us in the room) and when they were done he said that she just has a lot of things going on in her mind. 

As soon as we were driving home she was knocked out. We woke her up when we arrived home but then just proceeded to sleep again. This was Thursday night. And it’s not Saturday morning and she hasn’t really “woken” up. She did woke up a couple times only to shake and cry and then we’ll try to calm her and she’ll just sleep again. 

I want to know if it’s normal?

I feel like the doctor hasn’t been telling us the whole truth or maybe the dose was too much for a first timer?

He was insisting on admitting her to a mental health facility but it’s a long drive from home and I don’t think she will want to be there alone without family.

992,"Hey everybody, douchebag moderator here. As I'm sure you've noticed, Cobenfy has been the hot topic for the past couple of months. We've seen a lot of threads here and there asking questions about it or people sharing their stories. We even had an [unofficial Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1hnuqx3/if_your_on_cobenfy_karxt_please_comment_on_this/) of sorts about a week ago

I did post an ""official"" one when it was approved by the FDA 3 months ago (wild that it has been 3 months already... time flies when you're having fun, eh?) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1fr6jgq/megathread_karxt_cobenfy_approved_by_fda/) for general information... and on a sidenote, that snarky sign-off about the clozapine REMS [came true](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1gwqv9p/fda_panel_votes_to_eliminate_clozapine_rems_141/) around Thanksgiving. Not important, just for some cheap yuks.

To paraphrase what has already been said; Cobenfy is a novelty of an antipsychotic, the first one that presumably has *zero* risk of Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS), the most serious side effects of antipsychotics. While it does not seem to be as effective as clozapine- which, while having *minimal* risk of EPS, is still not zero- a new antipsychotic that actually works *without* EPS is unprecedented. It is similar to clozapine in how it affects the M1 and M4 receptors, so I refer to it as ""diet clozapine"" in a number of my write-ups... however, it is *diet*. Less side effects, but also less effective. 

EPS have been accepted as a 'unfortunate reality' since the days of Thorazine, the first antipsychotic, and the second-gen of antipsychotics was heralded by clozapine- which was *very* effective, but also caused minimal EPS. The convention in psychiatry dictated that effectiveness was proportional to EPS, so clozapine changed the game when it came on the scene. If we are to use EPS as the benchmark for generations of antipsychotics- then Cobenfy may well be the first of the long-awaited third generation of antipsychotics.

Now, I want to be perfectly clear here- *if you have experienced EPS on Cobenfy*, please share your story. What the pharmaceutical companies *say* is not always consistent with how things actually work... something the company that has been marketing Cobenfy (Bristol Myers-Squibb) has gotten in trouble for before.

However, on the plus side, when I was at my psychiatrist's office a couple weeks back, he had a few sample kits of Cobenfy sitting on his desk. Apparently BMS' pharma reps had been making the rounds. So... word is getting out. People are excited. I can't say I blame them. It's a pretty big deal.

What to post here:

1. Stories about taking Cobenfy, any hurdles with actually getting it (insurance, cost, etc.), whatever else- good *or* bad.
2. Questions about Cobenfy that are *not* psychiatrist/pharmacist questions- please ask the appropriate licensed professional if it crosses into the realms of professional advice.
3. Studies, news articles, anything like that.

What *not* to post here:

1. ""When is Cobenfy gonna be available in \[country\]?"" We don't know, check with your government's health authority about that.
2. Any antipsychiatry nonsense. You don't like meds, fine- but don't be a downer and dump on people who are excited. Go complain on the proper subreddit for that.

Anyways- have at it. Hopefully this post will turn out to be an effective tool for anyone popping in to check out the buzz on Cobenfy.

995,"
I’m pretty sure my coworkers think I’m on crack, but that’s not important. I have a standing appointment to have dinner with family member and I can’t function. I look like I’m on drugs.

996,"After experiencing something traumatic my mind began to seek ways to explain what I went through, and I entered a psychotic episode after no sleep for 24 hours. I felt EXTREMELY unsafe and like everyone was out to get to me, as if every single person was targeting me and I wasn’t even human but turning into a cyborg. Everything possible was dangerous (drinking water, eating food) and part of a bigger plot about technology and surveillance. I connected all these events in my life as evidenced as to why this was true and how I had finally unlocked it and it felt so real. 

That headspace made me feel like I couldn’t sleep without something harming me and the world ending (I was convinced I was on a mission to save the world and if I slept in my dorm by myself I wouldn’t be able to save it and would turn into a cyborg) so I reached out to my closest friend. He got freaked out by my energy and called an ambulance but the police showed up instead. I told the police I was too scared of the hospital because I was convinced that they were going to hurt me there once I fell asleep. Even though it was so evident by my body language and my appearance I wasn’t okay. 

Him and his roommate (who was my friend) started to gang up and file a restraining order against me. So when the campus police spoke to me they told me if I harassed my friend again, that I would be arrested. I was not in the right mind to even process these instructions and that was obvious. The roommate was getting entertainment value out of this and sent me a text “I just want you to be safe whether it’s with us or not” when I asked if I could come by one final time. I interpreted this as an invitation that maybe they would finally let me in and I would get to sleep and so I knocked on their time a final time, I did not even enter. Immediately after knocking, I decided to leave the building and was on the lower floor on the way out.

At this point the police who were camping outside waiting for me to knock, excitedly approach me. “We’re gonna have to arrest you,” they shouted. “For breach of peace and trespassing.” 

They looked so excited and happy to do so. They seemed to feel very accomplished even though I was pleading with them, explaining I was literally on my way out to leave the building and that I misinterpreted a text that was sent to me. I asked them to please just take me at the hospital because I was starting to realize the irrationality of the situation. I’ll never forget the happy vindictive glint in one of the cops eyes as he cuffed me, a nineteen year old girl obviously going through psychosis. 

They cuffed me and brought me to the police station where they spent two hours taking mugshots and ridiculing me. After that I was STILL, if not even more terrified to sleep because I felt like I was a threat to national security or something. I ended up falling asleep in the room of a RA while I was shaking from the sound of voices flooding my hearing. 

I don’t blame my friend for calling the ambulance. He didn’t want to see me, which is valid, and he had good intentions. His roommate was extremely manipulative and influenced him negatively. Apparently after I was arrested, the roommate was laughing about how I was a felon. 

Anyways, it took six months for my charges to get dismissed and I spent those six months fantasizing about myself in a jail cell, paranoid about EVERY SINGLE THING, and making even more horrible choices like not arranging myself housing and distancing myself from all my friends out of shame and guilt. 

I feel so much fear and anxiety constantly and the event replays in my mind over and over. The fact that it happened when I had already gone through something traumatic (which is why mu symptoms were so much worse than usual), I’m pretty sure gave me PTSD. I lost my support system because I felt so guilty, that I didn’t text anyone back for months. I don’t know if I’ll ever recover from the trauma of this. I can’t get over how stupid I was. If I had just eaten something, if I had just gone in my room, if I had just calmed the fuck down… I want to die.

1024,"So, I don't know why, but I know I was behaving very oddly walking around my apartment complex. I got lost in my own complex. A police officer showed up, I guess someone called him because of me, and started asking me a bunch of questions. I was in psychosis but he may have thought something else was wrong. So he wants me to take him to my apartment.

I go in, I'm soooo out of it, but this is where it really saves my ass. I didn't realize it, but I walked into the wrong fucking apartment. It took me and even the officer a few minutes to figure out what was wrong. I was 2 buildings down from my apartment. Nobody was there even though I heard people in their rooms. The police officer figures this out and immediate starts asking ""how much did you have to drink today?"" and I somehow remembered my schizophrenia medical alert card that I ordered when it got popular on this sub a few weeks ago. I handed it to him and he made a face like ""uhh what's this?"" but as soon as he saw it was a med ID his whole demeanor automatically changed. He became a lot more relaxed and understanding. He just said ""come on, lets get you home"" and walked with me and made sure I got home safely.

1027,"It was devastating seeing the body cam footage and now knowing she was schizophrenic, it breaks my heart even more. She called because she was scared and believed there was a intruder in her home and Sean Grayson killed her. She didn't do anything. She was nice and gentle with the officers the whole time. She never deserved her cruel fate.

We know the feeling of being paranoid and believing someone broke in. She did what many of us would do and called the Police because she thought she was in danger. And without knowing, they were the danger.

1062,"I know I'm probably going to get some flak for this post, but I hope some of you can learn from my mistakes. 


I've smoked weed sometimes in the past. I would usually get some light paranoia and more hallucinations than usual, but I could deal with it. 


On Thursday last week, my friend came over. They brought some LEGAL weed (weed is illegal in my country), and said it had a very low amount of THC, which sounded possible. Products with a negligble amount of THC are legal. 


I've been feeling awful lately. Flashbacks and anxiety attacks. So I thought I could smoke some and feel a bit more relaxed, since my friend said it was basically just CBD in the joint. 


I smoked half of the joint, and felt fine. Until I didn't. 


An hour after smoking, I got very overstimulated by lights and sounds. 20 minutes later, and I was losing my grip on reality. Hallucinations overwhelmed me, and I felt myself slip into a state of not being able to tell what was real or not. 


I kept seeing visions of me hurting myself, hurting my partner, I was crying and shaking, my heart beating faster than I've ever tried before. I was living my worst nightmare. 


I asked my partner to take me to the psychiatric hospital. I was trying so hard to keep my grip on reality, but I kept getting confused and I was absolutely terrified of hurting my partner. 


We arrived at the hospital, and I felt more safe, and then I lost the last contact with reality. I wasn't frightened as much anymore, since I thought I was dreaming. I got some antipsychotics and got a bit better at the hospital. My partner was there, holding my hand. 


I went home, stayed at home for a few days and felt fine, and then the psychosis came back. I'm now back in the hospital. Not quite sure if I'm delusional or not. Maybe I am, or maybe I'm right. 


I see a lot of you asking in this forum, if it's alright to smoke weed or not. It can be. It was okay-ish for me for many, many years. And then suddenly it really, really wasn't. It was the worst nightmare of my life. Please. Think before you smoke. ",schizophrenia

Slinging ""Get help"" as an insult bc were viewed as ""difficult and off putting"" comes from an insanely ignorant, privileged place, and it helps perpetuate the stigma and stereotypes about schizo people imo.

1223,"Hi everyone,

I’m spending this Thanksgiving in a psychiatric hospital, and while it’s not the holiday I imagined, I wanted to take a moment to send love and good vibes to everyone out there—whether you’re celebrating with family, on your own, working, or navigating your own challenges.

Being here has reminded me how important it is to take care of our mental health, even when it means stepping away from the usual traditions. It’s hard, but I’m trying to focus on gratitude for the little things: the staff who are kind, the support from other patients, and the hope that things can get better.

If you’re struggling today, just know you’re not alone. Sometimes the holidays can feel heavy, and it’s okay if you’re just getting through it one moment at a time. Take care of yourself in whatever way you need, and don’t be afraid to reach out for support if you need it.

1237,"Hi,

I’ve been following a channel previously called “Living Well With Schizophrenia”. It’s run by Lauren. Recently, she changed her channel’s handle to @LivingWell**After**Schizophrenia

She also changed her channel description to this:

> **I used to live with schizophrenia**. At the beginning of 2024 I began a strict program of metabolic therapies, specifically the medical ketogenic diet, to heal my brain. The result has been the elimination of all symptoms of schizophrenia, while also tapering off of all psychiatric medication. This is my journey of **living well after schizophrenia**.

(Emphasis added by me)

Afaik, Schizophrenia is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured yet and does not go into long term remission **without active medical management**. Such a person would still have schizophrenia, but would not experience symptoms, as long as they remain under treatment.

The way Lauren has worded this post, she makes it seem that her diet has “cured” her schizophrenia and that she will make videos about living life after being cured of Schizophrenia

I have read medical literature about the medical ketosis diet. There are zero publications or case studies claiming that a schizophrenia patient can 

1) start medical ketosis diet

2) stop taking all schizophrenia meds

3) “be cured”

4) eat a less strict diet and never have schizophrenia symptoms ever again

If what Lauren had said 

>“my doctors believe that, as long as I stick to my diet, my schizophrenia symptoms will never return,” then that would still be a remarkable claim! 

But by saying 

>“I used to live with schizophrenia,” 

It makes me think that Lauren truly believes that she no longer has a mental illness at all. Does Lauren really believe that she is cured, or am I missing something?

Is Lauren being way too optimistic? Is Lauren spreading misinformation about schizophrenia? Or has Lauren and her doctors cracked the code and literally cured schizophrenia?",schizophrenia

1402,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I knew he was schizophrenic and tried to tell my family long before he was diagnosed. They didn’t believe me. Even after he was diagnosed they didn’t buy it. Of course they tried to help, but they were treating it like someone going through a phase or like something that was temporary. 

I came here 6-ish months ago looking for help. You all gave me wonderful advice but it was me against my family and they wouldn’t listen. 

It just got too bad. He was too far gone. My family keeps telling me “there was nothing we could do” and that virtually all people with schizophrenia live terrible lives until they die alone (of course they finally admitted it was schizophrenia after he died). But I know that isn’t true because I see many of you on here trying and succeeding— people with this illness CAN be helped. I don’t have the heart to verbally disagree with them because the lie helps them sleep at night.

Edit: forgot to mention he was also schizoaffective.

Edit: not sure where I gave the impression that my family didn’t care about him. They tried very very hard. They were just treating it as if it were a phase or a personality problem. If someone is severely schizophrenic they need more help than the ‘average’ person with common emotional issues.

1758,"Last year all I wanted was my first ice cream cake but I couldn’t get it because I was experiencing psychosis

This year I’m finally on my meds, working a job I’ve been trying to get for years, and I have a therapist who is meeting with me and my friends soon to discuss an emergency plan in case I experience psychosis again

And I’ll be getting icebox cake this weekend which is the cake I had on my 2nd birthday :)",schizophrenia
1768,"was super overwhelmed hallucinating & stressing  about the possibility of becoming homeless again (i have 7 days to make $450 somehow for rent 彡(-ω-；)彡) and ofc that translates to voices tellin me im gonna die in my sleep over and over & seeing demons all around my apartment !!!

i don’t ever really make art this style unless im in psychosis or super anxious, i do single line art mainly which is kinda interesting now tht i think abt it （；￣︶￣）",schizophrenia

yall are a buncha cool ass people and i love and appreciate all of you",schizophrenia
1784,We are very strong for carrying on and living every single day with a brain that’s actively destroying us. We were dealt such a shitty hand but we still wake up every day and deal with it. ,schizophrenia
1796,I just wanted to share. I was actually in the process of applying for disability but my job search provider got me an interview and it looks like I actually have a job again. I'm excited to have money for once.,schizophrenia
1798,So I just watched a Youtube video about schizophrenia and I saw a youtube comment with a lot of likes talking about how people with schizophrenia are **actually** hearing the thoughts of other people and what they're thinking. And also that antipsychotics are actually just a product from pharma to get money and turn people like us into zombies. Dont they realize how dangerous that statement is? This is just feeding into my delusions that everyone thinks im ugly and unlikeable and that some even want me dead(what im getting told by my voices). The medication is also one of the only reasons i can live a (kind of) normal live. This fucking comment just honestly ruined my day.,schizophrenia
1804,"Today, I made an enormous step, despite my shattering fear of doctors. I finally went and saw someone. Over only a short talk, he said that he was sure I'm showing early signs of psychosis, and gave me two referrals - one to a private psychologist, and one to a psychosis support program.

I'm so happy with myself. Everyone I've told is immensely proud of me. It took courage, but I'm finally on my way. I'm so tired of suffering.",schizophrenia
1817,"The voices are screaming at me every night, the meds aren't working yet again. 

Im going to end up having an episode and being sectioned again. 

Anyone got any advice?",schizophrenia
1820,"not trying to be a dick, but i’ve seen a massive influx of people who are too young for an official diagnosis of a schizophrenic condition on here. is it like a tiktok trend to have schizophrenia now? again i know i sound like an asshole but i can’t be the only person noticing this.",schizophrenia
1829,"I'm on the struggle bus but I managed to have a good day. I'm very symptomatic and very depressed. But I'm very thankful for the people who love me and show up for me. I'm also very thankful for this community that reminds me that I am not alone in my struggles and demons. Here's to successfully completing another year around the sun, and to the beginning of a new one. My birthday being on Selfie Sunday this year was a happy surprise for me, even if I don't often participate in sharing.",schizophrenia
1834,"idk if it's like a dope fiend getting a friend to share drugs... just thought it sounded fun

what analogy could i have used instead?

and remember to upvote any struggling posts on here

do you get psychotic from people upvoting, liking, etc. your posts/comments because you get that gratification dopamine boost in your brain and it messes up the chemical imbalance?",schizophrenia
1843,"I am incredibly nervous, not because I want a good grade, but when I hopefully pass in a few hours, I will have succeeded in a dream I was told to give up several times by Medical professionals.

And most importantly, it is the only thing left on my list of things I wanted to accomplish before 30.

Looking back just a few years, I still thaught this would be impossible in my condition


Wish you all a good day


Edit: new comment too - passed comfortably, thank you so much for The support, this sub is so supportive and Im cheering as much for all of you! You are the strongest and bravest people I know!",schizophrenia
1857,Hope everyone had a great day. ,schizophrenia

1877,Heavy meds not doing amazing ,schizophrenia
1882,"I got into a Facebook argument with a friend because of his fundamental understanding of mental illness. He was using psychotic and psychopathic as the same thing. FUCK NO. I know they sound similar and it may be an easy mistake to make, but damn it, psychosis just means a disturbance in how you perceive reality. We are NOT psychopaths and schizophrenia in itself does not mean violent!! FFS!!",schizophrenia
1885,"I was recently in a psychiatric hospital for two months and while it wasn't fun, I did meet some cool people there",schizophrenia
1890,"Thank you to this subreddit for giving me my relationship!! We would’ve never met if he didn’t comment “Floor time” on my first selfie Sunday post 🤣🤣🤣… so happy to be here, it sure is bumpy sometimes, but I know him and I will make it in the end. Have a wonderful day everyone. 🩷🫶💕",schizophrenia
1891,"Psychosis is a psychotic break from reality which is temporary and can be recovered from.  It has many symptoms similar to Schizophrenia but it is not the same.  Psychosis can happen again in a person even after recovery or remission, and it can happen with a person who has Schizophrenia.  

Schizophrenia is a permanent condition in which there is no cure.  Even if all your symptoms are taken away with medication, you still have schizophrenia, it never goes away.  This is why going off your medication is futile because you will always have schizophrenia.

When people say they have recovered that means they have recovered from Psychosis, this confuses people with Schizophrenia and makes them think they can come off medication when they are doing better.  Stop confusing people.

If you have Psychosis and not Schizophrenia, stick to /r/psychosis .

EDIT:  I do not mean to belittle anyone with Psychosis, it is a severe condition.  Talk to your medical professional to get the right diagnosis and try to understand that diagnosis completely.",schizophrenia
1892,"I have a stuffed bunny rabbit my mother bought for me in 2016, it has always made me happy, and when I was still working. I would take my stuffed bunny to work every day wrapped in a wash rag like a cape (to keep it clean(I was an auto mechanic)). I found when I would go into psychosis or have a severe panic attack, I would explain to my supervisor that I would be out of commission for the day, I would log out (with permission) go to my car, hug my bunny, take an hour or two nap in my car, then head home for the day. This would happen once or twice a month. My boss knew about my schizophrenia, and would allow it. I was a hard worker, and in charge of training the new guys. This continued until towards the end of 2019 when a new owner of the dealership came in and started cleaning house. My shop manager (my boss) was first to be fired. I was next, they fabricated a web of lies about my work and fired me. Every day since then I would carry my bunny with me anywhere I would go, if it required more than a few hours away from home. 


My Bunny’s name is Somebunny!! Her name was given to her by my
Mother. 


Yes, I am a 34 year old male who carries a stuffed animal bunny rabbit with him. She brings me a lot comfort, and helps with my issues.

1893,"i had seen on tik tok someone mentioning this, i had disagreed, because i feel the idea of “awareness” varies, i think when im in psychosis my sense of awareness deteriorates, but i feel its dehumanizing to claim us as unaware, what are your thoughts? are there better articles out there i can look at?",schizophrenia
1894,"I dunno if it's me or what, but I think that hallucinations tend to be easier to live with than delusions. I say this because delusions literally guide your actions and perspective on the world, while hallucinations are just frustrating at best and rightening at worst.

I much rather have hallucinations than fearing that people can read my thoughts or that my friends all hate me or that I'm being punished in the afterlife. It's so much to deal with and I hate it.",schizophrenia
1902,"this is nothing pretty about it. mentally, i am distraught--and yet i still see people ""similar"" to me romanticized in media. nothing pretty about downing al the pills. nothing pretty about the constant paranoia. nothing pretty about having to doubt reality, ""is [thing] really happening?"" it's not pretty to have someone tell you you're crazy, even though you don't think you are at all. it is not pretty.",schizophrenia
1911,I got approved for disability because of my schizophrenia. Now my work schedule is Tuesday Wednesday Thursday from 8:00AM-Noon. Working 12 hours a week. Getting $1287 a month on top of my wages. I'm so happy right now. Things are finally turning around.,schizophrenia
1915,"So this is day four with no power. I live in central Florida and after Helene then being hit by Milton sucks. My family has lost a lot. But everyone is alive so that’s what matters. 
Mentally I’m handling things well. 
What does suck is I had to cancel an appointment with my psychiatrist and psychologist. Now I have to cancel the one tomorrow as well because I can’t get there nor can I do it over the phone because I can’t waste my phones battery life. 

Hope everyone is doing better! 
Here’s to another day. ",schizophrenia
1927,"I know we’re not gonna keep young people away from weed, but with legalization movements, the inevitable consequences will be more people with this diagnosis. Also more people with anxiety, depression, panic attacks etc. 

It’s really sad the way it’s impacted me and my family. My advice would be don’t touch the stuff. It’s not worth it.
",schizophrenia
1928,"I never could have dreamed how much better life could get from when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017. Back then, everything seemed hopeless. 
Since then, I've gotten married, become an artist, found beliefs and faith that work for me, traveled internationally, improved my relationships, and now I am pregnant. 
It has taken years to stabilize. It didn't happen overnight. A lot of what causes hallucination attacks- strong emotional states like shame, fear and worthlessness- have been dealt with in therapy and through my own efforts to heal. I still hallucinate every now and then, but it is rare. I find it is almost always triggered by strong emotions/ provoking situations. 
External factors, such as medication, art, therapy and relationships have their part to play in my health. There are many reasons my life has balanced out. 
I sincerely wish happiness and peace for all who suffer with this disorder. It took a lot of uncovering and facing pain and much suffering for me to find a place of equilibrium. 
I know it's extremely challenging to find stability so I certainly feel deeply for those who are currently struggling with stabilizing. I don't have things perfectly figured out and I still sometimes suffer when I hallucinate.
Becoming a parent takes self-control, compassion and playfulness. I couldn't have done it years ago, but each stage of life requires a new shedding of the skin, without shame for the previous one worn. 
This already is a challenging yet exciting journey!",schizophrenia
1931,"When I first got diagnosed in a hospital  I thought of it as a death sentence. I was 18(20 now) and I knew it was progressive. I thought about the horror stories of losing my family and becoming homeless or having to take meds that’ll make me fat and lay in bed wanting to die all day. And the more I thought like that, the more it became true. 

But I can say now that I’m doing really well. I got on abilify and for whatever reason it works better than Zyprexa. I have a job, a place to sleep, I call my family every day to wish them a good day and to show them that I’m in a good place mentally. I’ve begun programming and working on projects. I have friends, I no longer abuse drugs, etc. 

Sometimes though I do still experience psychosis and even at work. But to me it’s nothing to be scared of. It’s like back pain. Some people experience it temporarily while other people it’s an everyday struggle. Schizophrenia to me is my form of back pain. And now that I’ve learned more about the illness and my specific delusions that come up I can dismiss it and move on with my day. The voices can be scary but when they happen(99% after I get off work). I take a nice warm shower. Lay in bed, and take a sleeping pill and pass out. 

This illness CAN ruin your life, but I won’t let it happen to me. I’ve reached out for help from god, doctors, and my family. I want to help people who are not as fortunate to have those resources. Because even though there’s not a cure there is hope to live a happy life",schizophrenia
1972,"7 interviews and 6 rejections later and I'm making more than my previously highest paying job. Finally I don't have to scrape by and I can get off of social security!

Just keep trucking folks. If you want to, take your meds. They can help tremendously.",schizophrenia
1977,I'm bragging and I know it. I just applied for disability for my symptoms and at the same time I'm handling a full time school load. This is just 1 year from my diagnosis. I want people here to know it is possible. Thanks guys for all the support.,schizophrenia
