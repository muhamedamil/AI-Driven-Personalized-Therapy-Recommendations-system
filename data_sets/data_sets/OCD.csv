0,"In my experience not at all.
I was afflicted with a type of OCD called “Pure-O”.
What this means is that I had the obsessions without the compulsions.
I developed an irrational fear that I was a bad person or would do bad things. These fears brought me great anxiety because I had no desire to commit these acts, thus indicating I was never in danger of actually committing them.
I ended up in a mental facility for two weeks where they realized and attempted to assure me, that I was not a danger to myself and others.
Through time and occupying my mind with other things, these thoughts subsided.
I still struggle with OCD, but those specific fears have not returned.
Hope this helps!",OCD

2,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
3,"Not really. OCD in itself isn't dangerous. But it can lead to destructive behaviors.
I am an OCD psychologist (at Mantra Care), and I've seen firsthand how OCD can manifest in various ways.
For instance, I once had a client with severe contamination fears. He was constantly worried about germs and spent hours each day cleaning. Initially, this might not sound dangerous, but it significantly disrupted his life.
He started avoiding public places, even missing out on important family events. It got to the point where he began using harsh chemicals to clean his skin, resulting in severe rashes and infections.
The real danger with OCD is when the compulsions take over, leading to physical harm or impairing one's ability to function daily.
My client's case is an example of how OCD, while not directly dangerous, can push individuals into harmful behaviors if not managed properly.
To help Sarah, I used cognitive-behavioral therapy, specifically Exposure and Response Prevention. And over time, my client learned to tolerate the anxiety and realized that their fears were unreasonable.
So OCD is not life-threatening but it can lead to severe behaviors which can be treated through therapy.
If you or someone you know is facing similar issues, you can contact me or other psychologists on Mantra Care. We’ll be happy to help.",OCD
4,"There are different type of OCDs. OCDs are mostly non-lethal, but can really ruin a person's life in other aspects.
Typically a person’s OCD will fall into one of the following four areas.
* Checking: the need to check is the compulsion, the obsessive fear might be to prevent damage, fire, leaks or harm
* Contamination / Mental Contamination: the need to clean and wash is the compulsion, the obsessive fear is that something is contaminated and/or may cause illness, and ultimately death, to a loved one or oneself.
* Hoarding: Another obsession long considered to be part of ‘OCD’ is the inability to discard useless or worn out possessions, commonly referred to as ‘hoarding’.
* Ruminations / Intrusive Thoughts: 'Rumination' is a term often used to describe all obsessional intrusive thoughts, but this is misleading. In the context of OCD a rumination is actually a train of prolonged thinking about a question or theme that is undirected and unproductive. Unlike obsessional thoughts, ruminations are not objectionable and are indulged rather than resisted. Many ruminations dwell on religious, philosophical, or metaphysical topics, such as the origins of the universe, life after death, the nature of morality, and so on.

5,"The question should be “How worst is OCD”
It was within me since my childhood as i used to ask the same question multiple times until my mind accept it, it will be even 4 or 10 times.
But it continued for almost 22 years since my childhood to July'12.
Suddenly, In August’12, I was bringing a glass of water for someone, then after filling the glass, a thought strucked my mind that there is something wrong like dust particles is in the glass and compel me to throw the water and again fill it with fresh one. It started with 1–2 times but over the time became a compulsory act for me to throw and fill for even 10 times wasting 10–15 mins to drink water.
The second instance, was when i was driving my bike, suddenly my mind asked me to check “Whether you have run your bike over someone” . Then i return back at my arrival point and used to inspect roads to confirm the same multiple times.Due to this I used to take extra time to reach my destination. For example - If A distance of 5km take 15 mins then I was taking 1 hours.
Activities was increasing day by day and this was in every act, i was doing that , apart from i have mentioned here.
I used to wash hand multiple times after coming out of washroom as i feel that my hand still not cleaned and even it was harming my skin badly.
I used to waste half an hour in the washroom repeating the act multiple times.
When i watch movies then a single movie of 2 hours taking 4 hours to complete because there was compulsion by mind to replay some scenes multiple times.
In winter, I was bathing many times even at mid night as there was a feeling that my dody is not cleaned after watching bad objects, garbage,dead body etc.
Was Unable to sleep and used to wake up the whole night thinking what happened to me while crying.
I was not able to study and also my memory power was becoming weak.
In tension, my heart beat used to increased much faster and my body trembles.
I was fond of counting each and every things multiple times and placing them in order untill my mind accept that its ok.
I as sufferring from OCD since 2012 August and started my trearment in 2015 after rigorius struggle of 3 years and taking medicine from that time. I was on sleeping pills for two years. I am still undergoing my treatment and feel nuch better now. But one thing i regret is i am almost 5 years behind in my studies as my friends are employed now but not me. Our neighbour asks my parent, what is he doing in all these years, but you can answer to some but not to all.
My family member laughs at me and treat the symptoms of OCD as joke because there is very little awareness about mental illness in India as we know mental means mad.
It is not something that i can show , look i have fever, but only feel it within ourself.
Still, My family except my father belives that i had nothing because with them i was good.
That was just horrible experience and i used to weep. when i think about it in hindsight.
I give credit to “ CRIME PATROL OF SONY” as this serial gives an important message at the end that if anything you think is not going right then don't ignore it, consult a physciatrist.
I now know the reason why people suffering from depression suicides because their family dont accept that such thing even exists.
No one was with me , I myself consulted a physciatrist as i was living away from my parents .
The worst thing is that even well educated person are not ready to accept that such disease even exists and its upto you to control it
Even i tried a lot to not do the said activity but it was impossible for me as my mind had taken my control.
Please spread awareness about mental illness and don't ignore it.
I want to specifically mention that those who are suffering from anykind of mental illness can approach me,I have fought the dreaded battle which 99% succemmbed to. I will guide you in all possible way & want to be a part of your journey of recovery. I don't want to let anyone suffer what I had gone through,it was brutal, heartwreching deadliest,harmful more than one can ever imagine. I want to be a part of society to facilitate and educate everyone out there about mental illness.I have unimaginable will power,self motivation,never die attitude no matter what and the capability to never bow down to anything across the globe ( it helped me immensely )
Sorry for the poor English.",OCD
6,"It depends. Many people have a certain amount. Early 2022 I was confined to hospital. My partner was having compassionate leave from work, since I was severely unwell. Cancer surgery (basal cell carcinoma removal) is “cretinous drama queen” but suspected respiratory failure had three days of crying before she visited me. She was allowed an hour each time except on my release day where they seemed to be dragging it out. But she has developed a “routine” of TV viewing that I don't find engaging. In my case if I'm putting chairs out then every table has to have the same style \colour chair in each place, and no mix and matching. One christmas function I spent an extra half an hour arranging the chairs so I could actually sleep that night. Because I put them out, other people put them away, I didn't stay to make sure they did it properly. At the gym I tend to use equipment in the same order, legs and arm s alternately. Same reps for each. Cleaning the motorcycle is an undertaking. Put the right polish on the right bits before sitting hav ing a beer and cutting polishing clothes which I can't use before all the polish has fogged. I then polish the bits in the same order as I applied it. I eat my food in a strict order. The bits I like least first and my favourite bits last. The sex doesn't bore my partner even though it's generally quite similar. I'll let you imagine shopping, although it makes sense that I'll select things firstly by whether they mean t o be chilled or frozen and then I'll put them on the conveyer so I can pack them straight in bags. Looking in my cupboards and fridge might actually scar you. I do have a straight edge to line cans and packages up properly.",OCD
7,"Actually people with OCD are usually the safest persons in the world, Their fears block them in doing something perceived as dangerous.

8,"OCD is classed as a severe anxiety disorder. While it is believed to be lifelong, many describe their disorder to be hidden until a traumatic event triggers it. This is what happened to me; I have ‘lived the experience’ of OCD for roughly 2/3 years now, but after studying it I realized my first compulsions came when I was a toddler.
Without treatment, you can fall so far deep down the rabbit hole that your brain is conditioned to believe being anxious is normal. It took me a long time to notice that I was tense every second of the day. And I am one of the lucky ones; my compulsions don't fully prevent me from leaving the house or doing things I need to do to physically survive. While it is still tiring, I can do it. My obsessions do not cause me to self-harm. While it is difficult for me to be in the presence of people that don't include my immediate family or partner, I am able to walk through a door. I am able to turn my light switch on or off once. Let me rephrase that I think I am one of the lucky ones.
Statistics have shown that those with an OCD diagnosis are 10 times more likely to attempt suicide than a person without. The world health organization claims that OCD is the 10th leading cause of disability.

it feels like my hands are controlled by my arms that feel like wire
my ocd is dangerous and suffering
I also have bipolar with a history of some psychosis
I am the perfect victim for OCD.",OCD
10,"I can talk about myself and that might give you some insight about OCD.
I first experienced a very mild form of OCD when I was around 16 and that was due to academic pressure at school and by the hullabaloo about the colleges I should get in after I graduate from school.
By the time I reached 19, I gained some obsessions and compulsions — still I didn't realise just yet I might have had developed OCD and took it — as something that everyone around my age experiences.
At around 20— after many nervous episodes due to OCD — when my compulsions started hindering my life — I recognised my OCD and started working towards mitigating and controlling it with proven methods and mental restraint.
Now at 21 — after researching significantly and extensively on mental health — fought my way through a very mentally infuriating time due to OCD — I came about two conclusions about how OCD is developed.
One, the genetic inheritance — I realised it late but observing my dad and grandma’s actions and some memories from my childhood — I realised that they are also in a way suffering from OCD — my dad’s paranoia when a certain compulsion of his is not fulfilled and my grandma’s sudden anxiety attacks due to overthinking fell in the range of obsessions and compulsions. I believe that the OCD that I had cultivated is in some or the other way is inherited through genetics.
Second, the environment around you plays an important role as well. In my case — I had the genes that by getting triggered by outside factors resulted in OCD — that took me by surprise. The pressure of being in an engineering college was daunting and thus my mind began to cultivate notions, obsessions and compulsions — assuring me if I will follow a certain routine — I would be able to survive college.
There are genes and there are many outside factors that our brain perceives as dangerous which helps trigger OCD.",OCD
11,"I have OCD and this is how I explain it to people. OCD is caused by ruminating thoughts. Ruminating thoughts are thoughts that occur over and over, and over and over, and over …. Each time the thought cycles through the brain it causes a small amount of stress or anxiety. Then the thought cycles through the brain again and an additional small amount of stress is added to the stress already in there. Each time the thought cycles through the amount of stress goes higher until eventually the OCD person cannot stand it anymore and must do something to relieve the stress. The OCD person will then do some odd behavior that will relieve the stress. Then the whole thing starts over again. An example would be “I locked the door.” “Are you sure you locked the door?” “Yes I locked the door.” “I don’t think you locked the door.” “Come on, I’m sure I locked the door.” “It’s possible you did not lock the door isn’t it?” “Well maybe it’s possible, but I locked the door” “I don’t think you locked the door.” “Well, maybe, I’m pretty sure I locked it, but I could be mistaken.” “You didn’t lock the door” “Ugh! Maybe I didn’t lock the door, but it’s ok if I didn’t” “You know it’s not really OK to have the door unlocked, it’s dangerous.” “You really think I did not lock the door?” “I know you didn’t lock the door. You should go check it.” “AHHHH!!!! OK, I’ll check the door.” OCD person checks the door, it’s locked. “There, I checked it, it was locked” “Good let’s watch TV.” … “I don’t think you locked the door.” Each time the stress level increases until the OCD person does something, in this case he checks the lock, to relieve the stress. Then the ruminating thoughts start over again. Each person has their own unique thoughts that they ruminate about. Mine is I get suspicious of my wife leaving me. That causes me to accuse her of cheating on me, which naturally leads to an argument which eventually drives her away, so it’s a self fulfilling prophecy kind of a thing. Fortunately I take medication for it and it is well controlled.",OCD
12,"This is an alternative view of what causes obsessive compulsive disorder that differs from the current world view which is based on the medical model of illness. A model that proposes something is physically wrong (or has gone wrong) in the brain and has to be fixed, often by medication.
Before we consider what really causes these problems let's take a closer look at current beliefs, there are three main ones:

1. OCD is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.

Dopamine and Serotonin are Neurotransmitters. These are chemicals that sit in the gaps between neurons in the brain and pass messages between the neurons. Low levels of these (particularly Serotonin) are blamed for many anxiety and depression problems.

Well, anxiety and depression deplete our body of many resources, including such things as strength, energy, concentration, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and no doubt neurotransmitters. Surely, any chemical imbalance is the result of these problems not the cause.

2. It is due to physical brain problems / differences

Some say that physical abnormalities in the brain may be the problem. That is, parts of the brain are different (usually larger) or working differently in people with these problems.

PET (Positron Emission Tomography) brain scans of people with OCD show increased energy use in the orbital cortex of the brain, compared to those who don't have OCD. This part of the brain is larger and more active.

Well... brain scans of violinists show the area of the brain devoted to his or her left fingers (the right primary motor cortex) to be 2 or 3 times larger than that of non-violinists. Constant use of these fingers in playing the violin cause this area of the brain to become increased and more active in general.

Again, rather than causing the problem, brain differences are more likely a result the problem.

3. It's in our genes.

A person who has lived a life full of anxiety or depression no doubt passes genetic information about these things to their offspring. However, unlike genetic information regarding physical attributes (eg. hair colour, eye colour, body shape etc.) that is fixed, genetic information regarding behaviour is not fixed. It comes in the form of predispositions. These are ways in which we are predisposed to behave given the right environment; that is, our life experiences.

We all come predisposed to learn language, but the main language we eventually learn to speak depends on where in the world we are born. Racehorses are bred to be good runners but they still have to be groomed and trained. Any genetic information that we receive from our parents can only be put into practice if the appropriate environment exists. The environment reigns supreme. The genetic influence sits quietly in the background, waiting to develop and flourish in the right circumstances or wither and die if not called upon. It has to be like this to enable us to adapt and survive.

So if it's not an imbalance of chemicals, brain abnormalities or our genetic heritage...what does cause obsessive and compulsive disorder?
Everyone shows over-checking, ritualistic and compulsive behaviour occasionally. How many people say 'touch wood' so as not to tempt fate? The religions of all cultures are based on rituals to appease the greatest power of all: God, who holds control over life and death.

The person who hears that there has been a number of burglaries in the area starts to check, re-check and check again all door and window locks before going to bed. This person has not developed a mental illness or disorder.
We all think and behave in ways associated with OCD at certain times in our lives ... times that involve danger, being scared and self-protection.

Not due to illness or ‘wrongness’, OCD is normal human behaviour that becomes grossly exaggerated due to certain life events and experiences. It develops and grows from life experiences that have made us scared.
And once we become scared (for no apparent reason) any of the problems that are currently classed as anxiety disorders can develop. So too can severe depression.
We are conditioned into OCD, it is not something that just happens to us. And far from being a mystery, we can map out how it develops and grows every step of the way.",OCD
13,"TW: Mental illness, s/h, death
Basically it starts with something small, like you notice something out of place, or you got yelled at because you did something incorrectly. Then it increases.
More things look out of place, and occasionally you can ignore it but most of the time, you just ‘have’ to fix it. If your handwriting is messy, you erase everything and start again. And soon enough it’s even higher.
Spending hours fixing your clothes, making sure your handwriting is neat, missing class, grades dropping. Late nights spent, torturing yourself in thoughts, full of ‘what-ifs’, and if you don’t end up getting help soon, then comes to physical pain (I’m sure you know what I mean), then you’re gone, dead. Honestly, the only reason I’m not gone is because that was part of my OCD, that I would go to hell if I killed myself.",OCD
14,"Understanding OCD : ""A Beginner's Guide to Understanding and Supporting Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder""
This is a debilitating anxiety-related condition characterized by intrusive and unwelcome obsessive thoughts that are often followed by repetitive compulsions, impulses, or urges.
_______________ ______________ ________________
What is it ?
OCD is often marked by thoughts that reflect an excessive sense of responsibility for keeping others safe and an overestimation of the perceived threat an intrusive thought signifies. OCD is cyclical (below) and often starts with an obsessive thought, which the person focuses on, in turn raising anxiety levels. Checking everything is in order and following rituals can provide relief, but thedistressing thought returns.The obsessive thoughts and compulsions are timeconsuming, and individuals may struggle to function day to day or have a disrupted social or family life. The disorder may be triggered by an event in theperson’s history that they felt highly responsible for. Family history, differences in the brain, and personality traits also play a part. An examination of thoughts, feelings, and behavior patterns determines OCD, but its similarity to other anxiety disorders can make diagnosis difficult. With pure OCD, a person has intrusive and disturbing thoughts about harming people, but rather than performing observable compulsions, their compulsions take place in the mind.
_______________ ______________ ________________
OBSESSIONS (THOUGHTS) :-
1. Fear of causing harm
Excessive attention paid to thoughts about actions that could cause harm.
2. Intrusive thoughts
Obsessive, repetitive, and even disturbing thoughts about causing harm.
3. Fear of contamination
Thinking that something is dirty or germ-ridden and will cause illness or death to the person or someone else.
4. Fear related to order or symmetry
Concern that harm could result unless tasks are done in a specific order.
_______________ ______________ ________________
COMPULSIONS (BEHAVIORS)
1. Rituals
Following rituals such as counting or tapping to prevent harm and provide relief from the cycle of fear.
2. Constant checking
Examining household appliances, lights, taps, locks, windows (to counter fear of causing harm by fire), driving routes (fear of having run a person over), or people (fear of upsetting someone).
3. Correcting thoughts
Trying to neutralize thoughts to prevent disasters.
4. Reassurance
Repeatedly asking others to confirm everything is OK

TREATMENT
❯❯ Cognitive behavioral therapy involving exposure to triggers and learning how to control responses.
❯❯ Anti-anxiety medication and/or antidepressants to help relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety.

“An average person can have four thousand thoughts a day, and not all of them are useful or rational.”
- David Adam ( British author )",OCD
15,"I'm an OCD psychologist at Mantra Care, and after seeing several patients and conducting years of research, I've realized that OCD is a complex and multifaceted condition.
OCD is caused by a combination of genetic, neurological, behavioral, cognitive, and environmental factors.
Genetically, there's evidence to suggest that OCD can run in families, indicating a hereditary component. Neurologically, OCD has been linked to abnormalities in certain areas of the brain, particularly those involved in decision-making and emotional regulation. Neurotransmitters like serotonin also play a crucial role in this condition.
Behaviorally, certain learned behaviors can contribute to the development and maintenance of OCD. For instance, if a person repeatedly finds that a particular behavior reduces their anxiety, they might continue doing it, reinforcing the cycle of obsessions and compulsions.
Cognitively, people with OCD often experience intrusive thoughts that are misinterpreted as significant or dangerous, leading to distress and compulsive actions meant to neutralize these thoughts. This misinterpretation is a core feature of the disorder.
Environmental factors can also trigger or worsen OCD. Stressful life events, trauma, or significant changes can act as huge triggers for the onset of symptoms in most individuals.
So, OCD is not caused by a single factor but rather an interplay of several influences.
If you or someone you know is struggling with OCD, professional help can make a significant difference. Feel free to connect with me or other OCD psychologists on Mantra Care if you need support and guidance in treating your OCD. We’ll be happy to help",OCD
16,"There are probably multiple causes of OCD. No specific causes have yet been identified, and OCD may actually be the single way the brain responds to multiple problems.
One thing is clear however: OCD is a biological disease of the brain. Adding to this biological element are various environmental factors that also play a role. So although the exact causes of OCD are not fully understood, a combination of biological and environment factors seem to produce it.
Anatomic Factors
Some studies have shown increased or decreased metabolic activity in various parts of the brain. Other studies have shown defects in one of the “electrical” circuits that transmits nerve impulses to various other parts of the brain, in particular the cortico-striato-thalamo- cortical circuit. Abnormalities have been found in the prefrontal cortex, which is the decision-making portion of the brain, and in parts of the motor and sensory relay stations in the thalamus.
Biochemical Factors
There are many chemicals in the brain that serve this function in the various parts of the brain. In OCD, there are many neurotransmitters that seem to play a role: serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and possibly others.
Serotonin (also called 5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT): Evidence suggests that serotonin is a key element in OCD. Drugs that affect the serotonin system produce improvements in OCD symptoms. Dopamine: Similarly, evidence suggests that dopamine, another neurotransmitter, plays a role in OCD. On brain scans of patients with OCD, there is increased activity in one of the dopamine areas of the brain called the basal ganglia. In patients with known diseases of the basal ganglia, OCD symptoms are frequently present.
Genetic Factors
Even though there are clear instances of family members having OCD, particularly parents and their children, studies of genetic linkage and of specific “candidate” genes that may be the cause have produced mixed and unclear results. This area is obviously of extreme interest, and it is likely that more clarity will develop in the coming years.
Environmental Factors
Although perhaps not a true “cause” of OCD, certain environmental factors can trigger the appearance of OCD or, in patients already suffering with OCD, can worsen some symptoms. Well-identified external factors include abuse of any kind, changes in living situation, other medical illness, death of a loved one, school-related problems, relationship problems, and other life stresses.
Psychological Theories
Freud classified OCD as a psychoneurosis. He said that the root of the illness is a disturbance in the sexual life or the development of the child who goes through the stages of oral, anal, and oedipal sexual interest.
Cognitive theories
These theories suggest that obsessions represent catastrophic misinterpretations of an individual’s thoughts, images, and impulses. Overestimation of threat, perfectionism, and intolerance of uncertainty are examples of faulty cognitive processes.
Streptococcal Infections
Some children develop OCD symptoms after streptococcal bacterial infections. This reaction to infection may be seen in 10% to 20% of children who develop OCD.",OCD
17,"Q: “Why is the exact cause of OCD unknown?”
The idea that the 'exact cause' of OCD is unknown may itself be a mild symptom. It is not unknown.
In individual cases the exact cause is difficult to locate, especially for the individual concerned since it is rooted in memories and ideas that have been repressed (anxiously) early in development, often before language has been acquired. Essentially, though the mechanism is understood.
Early mental development must solve an apparently existential psychological problem that needs support from the environment (especially parents, mother) if it is not to cause more anxiety than is tolerable. The baby is born with omnipotence of thought — she has no reason or capacity to recognise her thoughts and wishes are different from the external world of physical events. That realisation is gradual, and in some senses is never absolutely achieved (we still 'tap on wood’ as adults).
At the same time the newborn has no experience or knowledge that would allow her to moderate her passions, especially the negative ones, in the face of the innumerable frustrations that a real world presents every other minute of the day — hunger, absence of the mother, colic being just a few. When hunger or absence occurs why should a baby assume it will not last forever? When frustrated a baby will have extremely hostile emotions — and crucially — associated fantasies of destruction, at a time when fantasy and reality cannot be distinguished one from the other.
Every time a baby cries she may have to deal with existential anxieties that she may have destroyed the world and everything she loves, mother included — a token of death.
Parenting anxieties and chance adverse events like illness, losses and actual deaths may conspire to leave some of these anxieties uncontained, which leave the infant having to find mental ways of coping with them themselves to some degree.
The Unconscious is a timeless and omnipotent realm, out of which conscious awareness has grown. Those anxieties about our own destructive fantasies when angry or distressed will persist in that realm, ready to trouble us if circumstances frustrate us again. Later in life — it may be as an older child with language, or an adult — when we fear frustration will arouse destructive feelings, we may use obsessive rituals (OCD actions) to 'magically’ (a version of omnipotence) give us some sense of control over our feared hostility. This is not a comfortable control, as it never was as a baby. It is a very anxious and precarious state, as it was in infancy.
The details of the ritual — the counting, the repetitions — are 'chosen’ unconsciously to both satisfy the demands that they should disguise the repressed fear, but that they should link to that fear by association in some way only the Unconscious might unravel. This is why these rituals appear irrational. They are not irrational, they are cryptic — a more compulsive version of 'tapping on wood’.
The ritual promises to avert the infant's fantasy catastrophe of destructiveness. Obviously the reality is that the infant was never omnipotent and fantasy/thoughts/wishes can not destroy in reality, so that the whole behaviour is unnecessary.
In order to change this dynamic however, rational thinking will not avail, since the Unconscious is not moved by it (which is why we need to have conscious awareness in the first place). A wholly different process of emotional 'insight' is required, which may be achieved by various means, including psychotherapies.",OCD

19,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
20,"In my case, I was running through a series of numbers in my head & then I'd do the same thing backwards. And as I counted away numbers obsessively inside my head. Id then add other warped thought that turned the Ritual into a “if I don't complete this ritual without getting a single number wrong then I've got to start from the beginning again” it morphed ? I was also attaching bad thoughts if I wasn't able to do it right ! I was always in a manic frame of mind. Id displayed OCD traits as early as 11. The fully suppressed emotions of years & years of abuse. With no way of ending the abuse. And unable to release my emotions. I'd developed these early OCD habits as an outlet & a release for my energy.",OCD
21,"Hello, thank you for the answer request
For basic understanding of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder you need to check for patterns that can be indicative of OCD such as:-
Excessive hoarding
Excessive cleaning
Checking and rechecking
Being stuck with order and symmetry.
Repeating an action in number of 3 (such as washing face or blinking 3 times)
Perform seemingly nonsensical behaviour
Self doubting or doubting others due to false memory, etc.
Having said that one needs to understand that symptoms do not make a disorder, dysfunctionality does. So you can be highly organised or hold on to invaluable things but it doesn't necessarily equate to being OCD.
OCD is an anxiety based disorder and a key characteristic of it is the OCD cycle, which is:-
Obsessive thoughts: stress provoking and unwanted thoughts, urges and mental images. It may also include doubtful thought or false memories.
Anxiety: it's a false alarm that leads to the need to carry out a compulsion. It can be manisfested in form of worry, fear, distress or disgust.
Compulsion: any unwanted behaviour that is carried out to get relief from anxiety.
Relief: temporary relief ; it is short lived as obsessions come back after a while.
There are various behavioural therapies that can help in breaking this vicious cycle. If you think you have OCD visit a mental health professional now.",OCD
22,"Main Criteria (DSM-5)
Both obsessions and compulsions must be present on most days for at least 2 weeks. These obsessions and compulsions must cause significant distress, be time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day) and interfere with the person's normal occupational, academic and/or social functioning.
Many people assume OCD is just about compulsive cleaning. But this is not true, and the reality is that the obsessions and compulsions can be about literally anything, it varies from person to person.
Obsessions in OCD are defined as distressing images, or impulses that enter a person's mind repetitively. These images or urges are often violent, inappropriate, and/or nonsensical, and the person attempts to resist them.
Compulsions in OCD are defined as ritual-like behaviors that are not enjoyable and that are repeated over and over. The person often recognizes that the behavior is ineffective and makes attempts to resist it, but is unable to. The compulsions are direct attempts to relieve anxiety from the obsessions. Excessive avoidance of situations that might trigger obsessions is also considered ...

23,"Many healthcare professionals use a tool called a structured clinical interview to see if your symptoms are consistent with OCD. Structured clinical interviews contain standardized questions to ensure that each patient is interviewed in the same way. These questions usually ask about the nature, severity, and duration of symptoms. You may also be asked about your mood or other symptoms to make sure there aren't other psychological problems that need to be addressed.",OCD
24,"OCD is diagnosed by interview. That is the professional doing an assessment asks about what you are experiencing. If you describe obsessions and or compulsions that take up significant time, cause significant distress and or interference with functioning then a diagnosis of OCD is likely to be appropriate.

25,"Well, this is a tricky question. For long time now, I got to the assumption that borderline gets misdiagnosed in a higher percentage than it gets diagnosed.
Basically, the only criteria met in all variations a borderline can turn, are the 9 symptoms you can find everywhere on the web. From those 9, you need to meet 5 of them, constantly, for a certain period of time, in order to be classified as a borderline personality disorder sufferer.
I will list the symptoms here:
Fear of abandonment. People with BPD are often terrified of being abandoned or left alone. Even something as innocuous as a loved one getting home late from work or going away for the weekend can trigger intense fear. This leads to frantic efforts to keep the other person close. You may beg, cling, start fights, jealously track your loved one’s movements, or even physically block the other person from leaving. Unfortunately, this behavior tends to have the opposite effect—driving others away.
Unstable relationships. People with BPD tend to have relationships that are intense and short-lived. You may fall in love quickly, believing each new person is the one who will make you feel whole, only to be quickly disappointed. Your relationships either seem perfect or horrible, with nothing in between. Your lovers, friends, or family members may feel like they have emotional whiplash from your rapid swings between idealization and devaluation, anger, and hate.
Unclear or unstable self-image. When you have BPD, your sense of self is typically unstable. Sometimes you may feel good about yourself, but other times you hate yourself, or even view yourself as evil. You probably don’t have a clear idea of who you are or what you want in life. As a result, you may frequently change jobs, friends, lovers, religion, values, goals, and even sexual identity.
Impulsive, self-destructive behaviors. If you have BPD, you may engage in harmful, sensation-seeking behaviors, especially when you’re upset. You may impulsively spend money you can’t afford, binge eat, drive recklessly, shoplift, engage in risky sex, or overdo it with drugs or alcohol. These risky behaviors may help you feel better in the moment, but they hurt you and those around you over the long-term.
Self-harm. Suicidal behavior and deliberate self-harm is common in people with BPD. Suicidal behavior includes thinking about suicide, making suicidal gestures or threats, or actually carrying out a suicide attempt. Self-harm includes all other attempts to hurt yourself without suicidal intent. Common forms of self-harm include cutting and burning.
Extreme emotional swings. Unstable emotions and moods are common with BPD. One moment, you may feel happy, and the next, despondent. Little things that other people brush off can send you into an emotional tailspin. These mood swings are intense, but they tend to pass fairly quickly (unlike the emotional swings of depression or bipolar disorder), usually lasting just a few minutes or hours.
Chronic feelings of emptiness. People with BPD often talk about feeling empty, as if there’s a hole or a void inside them. At the extreme, you may feel as if you’re “nothing” or “nobody.” This feeling is uncomfortable, so you may try to fill the hole with things like drugs, food, or sex. But nothing feels truly satisfying.
Explosive anger. If you have BPD, you may struggle with intense anger and a short temper. You may also have trouble controlling yourself once the fuse is lit—yelling, throwing things, or becoming completely consumed by rage. It’s important to note that this anger isn’t always directed outwards. You may spend a lot of time being angry at yourself.
Feeling suspicious or out of touch with reality. People with BPD often struggle with paranoia or suspicious thoughts about others’ motives. When under stress, you may even lose touch with reality—an experience known as dissociation. You may feel foggy, spaced out, or as if you’re outside your own body.
Basically, if a psychologist decides whether or not you happen to meet those situations in your every day life, for a long enough time and with notable impact on the way you are functioning socially, you classify.
Borderline seldom comes alone. No matter if it's just traits from the same cluster, or a whole different personality disorder, ocd, bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder, you name it. Or traits from one of them, or more.
This is what makes it very difficult to diagnose, and it's the main reason why it is often misdiagnosed. There are, by the possibilities of symptomology mixture, 256 different types of borderline. All mixed in with someone's unique personality, and influencing it. With a possibility to meet some other traits from other illnesses.
Sorry for the long answer, but I had to make a point on this.

Hope it helped.",OCD
26,"If you go on repeating certain behaviors without being satisfied or fulfilled by them by just doing them once. They become obsessions without any purpose of doing them. A normal person may wash his hands once or check the doors lock once while a person with OCD will go on washing his hands obsessively or go on checking and rechecking the lock obsessively and keep thinking again and again whether the door is locked or not , in spite of him/her locking it and checking it. There are people who are obsessed with god , money, movies ,reading books and sex all of which can become OCD gradually.",OCD
27,"OCD is diagnosed if a person has obsessions, compulsions or both which are distressing the person and which take up a lot of time per day.",OCD
28,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
29,"For the diagnosis of ocd
At least spending one hour a day on doing compulsive behavior like excessive hand washing . 1hour per day is spending on these excessive repeated behavior . Like washing hands 8to 9 time in order to get satisfied.
Than the person diagnose with ocd",OCD
30,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
31,"I am suffering from Obsessive Compulsive disorder (OCD). What should I do to control my repetitive behaviour?
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions and compulsions that intrude daily life and activities.
Intrusive thoughts, obsessive and compulsive behavior are some of the main symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive disorder. These symptoms are often debilitating, interfering in aspects of everyday life such as school, work, personal relationships and day-to-day tasks.
Obsessions include intrusive and persistent thoughts, ideas and images that evoke strong feelings of distress and worry. They are unwanted, uncontrollable thoughts that sometimes have taboo, sexual or catastrophic themes. Thoughts that are disturbing or odd do occur in most people, and they continue to go about their day without giving these thoughts significant attention. However, individuals with OCD experience and engage with these thoughts which can be severely debilitating and render them unable to move on from these thoughts.
Here are some examples of intrusive thoughts and thought patterns:
Disturbing aggressive thoughts such as murdering a loved one, such as a spouse, friend or child
Inappropriate sexual acts or sexual assault
Constant worry about infection from germs or environmental toxins
Intense fear that something catastrophic or fatal might happen to a loved one
Constantly wanting to reorder things till they feel ‘right’
The anxiety arising from these obsessions are managed by repetitive, ritualistic behaviour called compulsions.
An important distinction to be made between compulsions and habits is that they are and are time consuming and cause significant emotional distress, unlike habits. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or rituals that need to be done to relieve anxiety. They are performed not for the pleasure of doing them but rather to relieve the distress and anxiety that arises from not doing it. Individuals living with OCD show significant difficulty in controlling their thoughts and actions, in spite of knowing that they are irrational or excessive. Here are some examples of compulsive behaviour:
Checking - behaviours that give reassurance that something is done correctly, and safety si ensured for themselves and their loved ones
Rituals - mental rituals such as counting in a specific way, repetition of ‘good’ phrases to counter something ‘bad’
Touretic / Tic related movements - physical movements such as tapping, counting things, physical movements that ‘just feel right’
Washing and cleaning repeatedly, sometimes a certain body part or in a certain manner with excessive amounts of soap or cleaning. It also involves excessive grooming and routines related to hygiene
Management and treatment of OCD is facilitated by mental health professionals such as clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, based on the treatment method chosen. Here are the prevalent treatment methods you can explore while living with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder:
Psychotherapy is effective in managing the frequency and severity of OCD symptoms. Therapeutic methods such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Exposure and Response Prevention Therapy help in managing the symptoms and their severity. These work on the thought patterns underlying compulsive behaviour as well as the responses to situations that call for compulsive behaviour. Psychotherapeutic services are offered by clinical psychologists who can effectively diagnose and chalk out treatment plans based on the prevalent symptoms.
Medication is an effective tool in managing the symptoms of OCD. Medication and psychotherapy often go hand in hand, one augmenting the other. Approaching a psychiatrist can help in diagnosis and required medication is prescribed based on the symptoms present.
Psychotherapy and medication are highly effective tools for managing the symptoms of OCD. In addition to seeking out professional psychological help, here are a few self- help strategies you can adopt to manage your symptoms on your own:
Practice self care strategies that will help you cope with anxiety and stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger repetitive behaviour, so engage in activities that reduce stress and help you feel calm and relaxed. It can be a hobby, relaxing forms of entertainment or anything you find pleasure in doing.
Healthy lifestyle choices such as adequate sleep, regular exercise has proven to be effective in managing symptoms of OCD. Having a healthy diet also makes it easier to manage the symptoms you experience.
Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, deep breathing are highly effective tools that you can add to your relaxation routine. They help you bring yourself back from a state of stress and anxiety.
Support groups are a great source of social support, which goes a long way in helping you manage your symptoms. Support groups facilitate a sense of belongingness, a safe space to speak about your experiences and provides an opportunity to speak to people who go through similar experiences as you do.
Going through a mental health concern can be difficult and tiring. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be effectively managed with social support and professional psychological help.
Remember to take care of your mental health concerns as effectively as possible, and if you or anyone you know may be going through a mental health concern, kindly reach out for mental health support!",OCD
32,"The best way to treat OCD (Obsessive Compulsive disorder) is to try Exposure with Response prevention therapy. In this type of therapy a person is required to gradually expose themselves to their fear by not acting on their compulsions and sit with their distress till the time it subsides. Initially just after you expose yourself to the not performing a compulsion you will experience that your anxiety will surge up rapidly but you will just need to sit with it for sometime it will gradually decrease the anxiety after sometime. So the anxiety usually peaks then declines. Start with small things then increase it gradually. For example if you wash your hands 10 times just do it once and sit with the distress. Start with it for once a day then gradually increase the number of times you do it.
Another thing you can do is check your cognitions which means that when you get an intrusive thought check the validity of it. This can be difficult at first because thought-action fusion is a common component of OCD but if you keep doing it will be helpful. An example could be let’s say you have an intrusive thought that you have left the electric on in your house and it will burn your house down when you are out. Rate it on a scale of how likely this is to happen for example you think there is 85% chance of this happening. The question this thought and reframe it as ok what is the likelihood of electric kettle being left on and not burning the house and then think what is the likely hood of electric kettle not been left open. This can help manage the cognitive distortions present in the intrusive thoughts.",OCD
33,"Although I can't substitute medical advice, I would say that your symptoms most definitely meet the criteria of obsessive compulsive disorder. OCD consists of irrational and/or repetitive thoughts and compulsions which you must complete to relieve the obsession.
While giving in to these compulsions may relieve your OCD temporarily, in the long run it only reinforces it and makes it worse. If you do not want treatment, the only advice I can give you is ignoring it. It may be difficult at first, but you can do it. Think of how irrational it is. Research germs. Understand that you can't get sick that easily. You have to confront it. No matter how bad your compulsions get, DON'T FEED INTO THEM! Rationality is your friend.
Just confront the OCD and stay strong and rational. OCD thrives on irrationality.",OCD
34,"I am not a doctor, but if you have OCD it is probably a very mild case. Usually you'd be having a lot more symptoms if it's OCD.
For Example, you'd be obsessive about things like how neat your clothes are in the closet, or you'd be constantly doing things such as cleaning to occupy your brain.
The constant hand washing is common with hypochondriacs, and the nail biting and lip peeling could simply just be a bad habit.
It sounds a lot more like ADHD, but very mild. You could have a lot more symptoms for all I know. A little more information could help us guess what it could possibly be, but a doctor is the only one who can actually give you a diagnosis.",OCD
35,"Okay, so here’s the thing: mental quirks only become pathological if they harm your quality of life or cause you distress.
You aren’t distressed? You’re functioning well? You don’t want to change? Easy: don’t change! There’s no reason to.
Let me give you an example: Most people who have ADD or ADHD have trouble focusing on a single task. They flit from task to task. That’s me in a nutshell: so far today I have worked on two different books, worked on a new Web site I’m developing, leveled an alt in World of Warcraft, and worked on a new sex toy design. At the same time.
Right now, my computer has 3 book manuscripts, WoW, a 3D rendering app, and a Web editor all running at once.
Textbook ADHD? No. I like living this way. I get a lot done. I finish tasks. (I once had a girlfriend a long time ago tell me I should go on ADHD meds. I said “why?” She said “so you don’t keep switching from task to task.” I said “why would I want to do that? I get a lot of tasks done!”)

36,"Hi there,
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unreasonable thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress.
You may try to ignore or stop your obsessions, but that only increases your distress and anxiety. Ultimately, you feel driven to perform compulsive acts to try to ease your stress. Despite efforts to ignore or get rid of bothersome thoughts or urges, they keep coming back. This leads to more ritualistic behavior — the vicious cycle of OCD.
VICIOUS CIRCLE OF OCD-
OBSESSIVE THOUGHT — ANXIETY — COMPULSION--TEMPORARY RELIEF
Causes for OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) :
No specific cause of ocd has been established uptil now, researchers have found these following points contributing:
GENETIC - It runs in families, chances of you getting off are directly proportional to the number of parents, having this condition.
BIOLOGICAL - OCD may be a result of changes in your body's own natural chemistry or brain functions.
ENVIRONMENTAL - if you've experienced traumatic or stressful events, your risk may increase. This reaction may, for some reason, trigger the intrusive thoughts, rituals and emotional distress characteristic of OCD.
OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES - OCD may be related to other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse or tic disorders.
I would request you to kindly visit a psychiatrist(medication is needed in some cases) or a psychologist( for therapies) for the treatment. There are some good therapies which can pull you out of of without the negetive effects of medication like CBT, Exposure therapy etc.
Hope this helps.",OCD
37,"I don't suffer from OCD, although I have had a couple of friends who have worked with it and moved on. If I suspected that I had OCD, here's what I would do:
See a psychiatrist and pursue medical treatment for your symptoms. Prepare for the meeting by writing down your symptoms, concerns, and what relief would look like (i.e., how will you know when you're getting better, or how would you describe yourself before symptoms arrived)?
If you felt good about the psychiatrist, move forward with his or her treatment plan. However, if you had grave misgivings about your doctor, immediately make an appointment with another psychiatrist. I include this step because I've had some bad psychiatrists, ones with their own weird agendas, and I couldn't get away from them fast enough. Don't be afraid of this, though, as it was a small percentage of all the doctors I've seen.
Find a therapist. It is a combination of medication and talk therapy that relieves most mental illness. Your therapist can arm you with new ways of thinking that will protect you from your symptoms.
If you feel open around your therapist, continue going. If you feel frightened by your therapist or you don't trust him or her, pass on this particular person and try another. However, know that some anxiety is natural. Only move on if your therapist has lost your trust.
Keep going to both your doctor and therapist. Change can take time. You need to give the medicines a chance to build up in your system, and your new, healthier way of dealing with stress time to take hold and become habitual.
Some other things that can help:
Observe your thought processes. Don't judge, just watch and remember.
Keep a journal. Try keeping an objective record of how you are dealing with unwanted thoughts and behaviors.
Write a friend about it. It can help to have someone else's ear. You may not get to the bottom of the problem, but you can make some important discoveries if you get your theories out in the open to see.
Try to loosen up the grip of your emotions on your mind. If you're feeling in danger, it's going to be difficult to make real change. Try techniques like slowing your breathing and becoming hyper-aware of your senses.
Related to the last one, also try to bring your focus away from your mind and its rules to the outside world. What's in the room or space you're in? How does it sound, how does it smell? Sometimes exposing yourself to something that's overwhelming to your senses can cement your focus on the outside world, such as smelling lemon juice or feeling something soft under your hands, like a pillow.
You can try alternative therapies, like acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, or Alexander Technique. I've had psychological relief from certain sessions of these, but my diagnosis is different than yours, so results may vary.
Jump start your happiness. What makes you laugh? What show is your guilty pleasure? What movie have you seen more than any other (careful here--make sure it's a positive one)? Indulge in a great meal, or make time for a walk outside today.
I hope you find the answers you need soon. By the way, most of the psychiatrists and therapists I've seen have had a sliding scale for people who didn't have the money to see them. Don't suffer when you could be getting help. Good luck.",OCD
38,"Hello,
Your symptoms sound very familiar to me. I have experienced many of the things you described. I am not a doctor, but I think you may have OCD. There are two main treatments for OCD. One is cognitive behavior therapy, and the other is medication provided by a psychiatrist.
You don't have to be creeped out by a psychiatrist. They are no different from other doctors! Would you be creeped out to see a doctor if your leg was broken? Of course not! Don't let the stigma prevent you from seeking peace.
I suffered for many years before I told anyone and got help. Now, I feel so much better. I can live a happier life. It's like the clouds parted and the sun came out.
I hope you seek treatment. You can live such a happier life than the one you are living. You don't have to feel anxious and fearful all the time, you can be calm and peaceful if you get treatment.
There is so much hope for you to get better!
I think you should take Shweta's advice. Call a mental health helpline. See if you can get treated at a major hospital for low cost. It will be worth it when you begin to feel better.
It makes me very sad to hear about this. If you want to talk more, let me know.
Good luck.

39,"Don't worry about it, because you don't have OCD. If you did, you wouldn't have to ask what was wrong with it, and you'd also know that having OCD has nothing to do with tidiness. I have OCD and while I'm not, like, a hoarder, I'm also not an overly tidy person at all.
OCD is an ego-dystonic disorder. That means that its symptoms are invariably at odds with the self-image, and repugnant to the sufferer. If you think having OCD is positive or no big deal, you don't have OCD. Period, end of story.
Liking your closet organized and your books arranged by subject doesn't mean you have OCD. Feeling your closet needs to be organized, or your books need to be arranged by subject, or else something catastrophic will happen to you or someone you love — that would be more an indicator of OCD.
I suspect your idea of what OCD is comes from the stereotype of OCD sufferers all being germophobes who are just obsessed with tidiness and/or cleanliness.*
As someone for whom OCD manifests in a completely different way than organization, tidiness, or germophobia, I get so tired of that stereotype, and of the idea that the disorder is nothing more than being anal or uptight. That's not what it is at all, and plenty of people without OCD are neat and tidy.
Having OCD means that your mind is never fully at rest. I rarely sleep more than four hours a night anymore, and as a result I'm almost always exhausted. I just can't shut my mind off and fall asleep.
I count every step, every swallow of water, and am fixated on “good"" and “bad"" numbers. I check my stove several times before leaving the house, even if I know I haven't used it since the last time I left the house. I also check my front door several times to make sure it's locked, every time I leave the house. A couple of months ago, on my way to my sister's house, I got about five minutes from home and then turned around and went back to check the lock one more time. Just to make sure. Because if it wasn't, something horrible could happen and it would be all my fault.
Does that sound like fun to you? Having intrusive thoughts that are constantly telling you something horrible is going to happen if you don't do things exactly a certain way?
Again: you don't have OCD. Thank your lucky stars for that. And please don't cheapen its effects on those of us who actually do, and know what hell it can be.
(*The other possibility is that you could have OCPD, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is an ego-syntonic, Cluster C personality disorder characterized by a need for perfectionism and neatness, and in which you will not find your symptoms distressing. But you'd need diagnosis by a mental health professional to know for sure, and it's a distinct disorder of its own — not OCD.)",OCD
40,"It sucks. It is like there is a super annoying voice in your head that won’t leave you alone about matters of conscience. For example, Catholics speak of “mortal sins” while Protestants talk of the “unpardonable sin.” The voice tries to persuade you that you’ve committed such sin and that severe consequences are going to befall you. You try to “make things right,” but the voice always causes you to doubt whether you actually have, and you feel the need to confess the same things over and over or seek reassurance from a priest, pastor, or other religious authority. You desperately want peace but that voice never shuts up or leaves you alone. It plays on your weaknesses. It causes you to want to avoid the things that others find comfort in, whether that be confession, going to Mass/church, reading the Bible, taking Communion, etc. During those times, the “voice” pounces in you and makes you feel a nagging sense of having done something wrong, or at least makes you question whether you have. Unfortunately, you can never really find the certainty in these matters because there’s ultimately no way to “prove” you haven’t sinned or that God has forgiven you or accepts you. You always wonder, “Well, what if I did [this thing] [enough, correctly, unknowingly, genuinely, etc.]” and peace eludes your every move. You’re constantly walking with that that little rock in your shoe, which is the original meaning of a scruple.",OCD
41,"What is it like to have scrupulosity?
Well, you have OCD, like washing your hands over and over again. Life gets annoying. You take few drugs, the OCD gets reduced.
And now, think when it attacks your own beliefs concerning religions or epistemology. How would it feel? What drugs would you take to reduce your compulsive thoughts on these matters?
There’s no cure! You are on your own. It leads to extreme level of skepticism. Ordinary people who suffer from the religious crisis, embrace atheism and may find peace. But scrupulosity patients won’t find any peace even after leaving their religions. Hence, these people turned out to be some of the most devout religious pupils of all time.
Ordinary OCD looks nothing compared to scrupulosity!",OCD
42,"I cannot explain how awful it is.
I have had OCD since I was 5 and scrupulosity is my most common and worse type of OCD. Stress and anxiety makes it a LOT worse as well.
I am a very devout Christian protestant who adores Jesus so much…and so it attacks me to no end. That I don’t believe in any of it, that Jesus was not real…that I am not really saved…I’ve lost my salvation because I said this or that…I get overwhelming fears that I am going to wake up in hell because I might not be “properly” saved etc.
Even though I know in my heart I must be saved, with the broken mind, there is no reasoning. People around you think it so odd that you think like this because they can see my Christian lifestyle and how I hate sin and want to please God in everything I do. I try my best to re-assure myself of this is how I truly am, but the thoughts are relentless and I battle to find any peace.
My thoughts are in a constant loop, and even though I know what I have to do, that I have to try let the thoughts pass through, I often cannot do it because the feared consequence of ignoring the thoughts is just too overwhelming.
Some of the most amazing Christians had severe OCD including Martin Luther and John Bunyan (author of Pilgrim’s progress). John Bunyan however was worse than Martin Luther. I’ve just finished listening to John Bunyan’s autobiography on his suffering with the illness (they did not know it was OCD back then, but it was). He was used mightily by our Lord God, and that gives me great comfort, and I hope will bring comfort to many many believers in Christ suffering out there with OCD. Strange things is I do not see Christians mentioning his struggle with the illness. They know he was this great man of God, but no one seems to address the issue. It’s actually is suffering which is so fundamental to his closeness and dedication to God…it should always be mentioned.
Just know to anyone else suffering with scrupulosity, you are not alone. It is not your fault…the thoughts are not you and is contrary to your character, the love you have for Christ.
Jesus has you safe in His arms and will never let you go. He will be the one never to judge you, ever and knows your heart completely. He does not look at the mind…He looks at the heart.
Do not listen to anyone, including Christians, who judge you and your illness. Just know if they do that, they are behaving in contrary to how Jesus would and does treat you.
I do find reading 1 John brings me comfort, and reading certain scriptures. Some scriptures might make you worse, so when you are vunlerable, choose scriptures that you know won’t trigger you. Context of scripture is so so important.
JESUS DOES NOT JUDGE YOU. He is close to the brokenhearted…
The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them;
he delivers them from all their troubles.
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted
and saves those who are crushed in spirit.
The righteous person may have many troubles,
but the Lord delivers him from them all;
he protects all his bones,
not one of them will be broken.
Psalm 34:17–20",OCD
43,"Hell is a good description of it. I felt intensely guilty for every thought, action and feeling I had. I would lie awake in bed, praying to God to forgive me for everything, absolutely certain that he wouldn’t be able to forgive me because I knew that I would just do and think and feel those things again. And how can my remorse be genuine if I know I’ll just repeat what I’m remorseful for? I tore myself apart nightly, searching for the rot in me that caused this, but ever unable to pin it down other than the conclusion that I was the problem. This complex played a part in my self-hatred and, even though I’ve recovered from it to a certain extent, the desire to be good, to do what’s right has poisoned my decision making to the point that I’ll deliberately do what makes me miserable to prove a nebulous point of good to no one in particular. I’m still trying to prove that I’m a good person and failing utterly at actually being good because that would require giving up on being good. Because only in giving up on being good can I let go of the hatred I feel when I’m not good — the hatred I sometimes let loose at others when I feel that they’re being bad.
I think it’s a matter of prioritizing feeling good over being good. It’s not that I don’t value being good — I definitely value it. I just don’t think I can do it. Not without doing it for the wrong reasons and thus undermining the whole process.
I’ve largely discarded the whole good/bad thing and brought it down to a simple statement. Don’t deliberately hurt myself or others and, when in doubt, be kind. I can do that. It’s an easy guideline, much easier than the complicated mess of right thinking/right feeling/right action tangled up in the kind of goodness I was attempting when suffering from scrupulosity.
I think, ultimately, scrupulosity was just another way to hurt myself. If being good hurts you and leaves you bleeding out, then it isn’t good that you’re trying to be.",OCD
44,"I have OCD which manifests in several ways. My father has Scrupulosity. I never realised he had a problem growing up, he was just dad. He was weird though, I could see that and different to other friends dads. I was born into a religious family living in the Bible belt so not unlike many families we attended church. We went whenever the church doors were open-at least 3 times a week except for revival and summer vacation camps as I got older. From a young age children were to be seen but not heard. We (my siblings and I) were to be ridged little soldiers and listen to the ""Word of God be preached"" I was 4 my earliest recollection. On Sunday nights church would go so late for a little person. after 9 pm we would get tired and cranky or act up or hit each other, or talk. We would be taken outside to be ""dealt with"". When we got home dad's belt would come off and he would whip us for misbehaving in church. Dad would pray a lot of the time and he still does. We all had to bow our heads and pray before each meal. We were unable eat until dad had ended with ""bless this food and the hands that prepared it"" The prayers were always long winded and about how grateful we were to have food, etc. When Dad was especially serious he would fast and pray or spend time in his darkened bedroom on his hands and knees praying. This could last for days and we had to be quiet during this time as it was a solemn event. At other times Dad would sing religious songs or listen to religious programs on the radio. The radio always played softly in the background of a station that I actually enjoyed even as a child. It was WPCS radio station in Pensacola. Television was the ""idiot box"" he would call it so he would not buy a television. My father went to college and not just any college to learn a valuable skill! He went to Bible college. My father gave his free time to the church. He preached on street corners and spent money on printing brochures about the End or the Rapture coming soon. He believed in the bible as the infallible word of God. Dad's vacations from work were spent ministering to others. For a few summers dad would go to Mexico to minister to people who did not know Jesus to bring more souls to Christ. I liked it when dad was gone then because the house was happy and felt lighter. Mom was fun and not tyrannical like dad. Dad carried a gloom about him, an oppressiveness and he still does. Dad decided to become a missionary and everything we owned was sold or given away. We went to Texas where my parents went to school each day to learn Spanish and prepare for heading into Mexico. This lasted 3 to 6 months-I can't remember. This was a hard time because the church we had been attending in Florida did not support my fathers decision to leave. They refused to support us in this venture. Dad used up what cash reserves he had and when finally destitute without church support we left back for Alabama to live with my Dad's mom. She was cold and not fun. She held no interest in children. It must have been hard on her. Jobs were hard to find. I was 7 years old. Later he got a job and bought a trailer still things were financially so hard. I remember seeing dad place cash to tithe in the collection plate when we had no groceries at home. This made me angry. I was unable to do anything to generate income as a preteen in a rural town and believed this was not right. We went hungry while dad prayed for a job. As small children we were made to learn scriptures each week. We were made to have prayer meetings each night at home. We were just children I remember being aged about 7 through 12 or 13 during this phase. Dad would make us all get on our hands and knees in our living room to pray. We had to listen to dad read the bible and we all had to pray and do so correctly. We could not leave anyone out in our prayer. The prayer had to be begun and ended appropriately. We had to pray out loud, individually. I hated when dad prayed because he would go on and on and on. Dad would pray for at least 45 minutes to an hour so instead of helping us with homework this was his one and only focus. Many times I fell asleep on my hands and knees. I learned to like hard work early on having worked from the age of 12 and had to bail out my parents financially on many occasions. I still do. Meanwhile Dad has given up jobs that took him away from being available for church. Dad has had a vehicle repossessed and a mobile home due to his lack of enthusiasm with work. He is too old to work now but life is still a struggle. As a young child I had not been allowed to wear anything except dresses that went below my knees. Usually od and dated from the thrift shop. I remember being stared at when minisirts were fashionable. I was not allowed to wear make-up. I was not allowed to go to a cinema or, God forbid-to a dance or to a football game. At 18 I rebelled. My father found out that I was no longer a virgin. He told me that no man would ever want me and that I may as well marry the man. He said that I had ruined his good name. He could not look at me for 3 months. due to the shame he felt. If he saw me when he would enter the room he would look painfully at me then shake his head as if in despair then he would turn and look away from me. I remember thinking that by marrying the man I was going to right the wrong I had committed. I left home and did marry that man. 13 years later when I left my husband my father wrote me letters telling me that I was going to Hell because of leaving my husband. That I needed to repent and ask God to forgive me. All the books in our home were about the bible along with lots and lots of bibles, King James version and other versions I cannot remember or care to remember. Other religions were an abomination to the Lord. When I was 5 for Christmas all of us childen received a new Bible. I think mine was white. We had never been taught to believe in Santa. This was frowned upon. We were poor so I so looked forward to Christmas day. When I saw the unwrapped gift-no need to waste money on wrapping paper; I remember asking my dad why couldn't I have been given a doll as I could not yet read. I had not attended kindergarten because you had to pay to go to kindergarten and we had no money. Dad told me I would appreciate that Bible one day. I hated that Bible because I wanted a doll like my friends had. I did not cherish that gift at all. I resented it. For my 6th birthday I was given a cheap necklace with a mustard seed under a plastic dome. Not a glitter glitzy girly gift! You must have the faith of a mustard seed! It was not attractive but it was a necklace. Dad tried his hand at preaching and had small churches of approximately 40 to 60 parishioners. Numbers dwindled when he was preaching. He was not an eloquent speaker and paused and ummed and ahhed a bit. To be honest he was boring while being dogmatic. It was painful to listen to him even speak. He also had double standards which I found offensive. He spent hours of time studying the bible when he could have gone out onto our acreage land and planted a garden to feed his children which he did one year only. My brothers and I were industrious hard workers valued for our honesty and reliability. Eventually the property our house was on had to be sold before the bank repossessed it like they did the trailer. Dad refused money from the government agencies. He felt that was not living by faith. God will provide. Many is the day we children were hungry with no food except potatos and ketchup because my mom and I collected glass coke bottles and took them in for the change and were able to buy potatos and ketchup. One summer we were given a field of watermelons and told we could sell them and keep the profit. Dad would not be seen on the side of the road selling anything nor were we allowed to. What would the neighbours think? We ate them all instead as there was not much else to eat. I so disliked watermelon for years. Meanwhile dad prayed. Our water pump failed one summer and we had no money to fix it so we hauled water from the river in 5 gallon buckets sloshing all around in the back seat of the car to flush toilets. We visited a relative for showers each night for over 3 months. It was awful. Even washing dishes was so challenging. Eventually the church learned about the broken down pump. The church we attended replaced the pump motor because Dad never could. Dad was always behind on bills, always in a pinch yet when offered a cash job dad felt it was wrong to not claim the money on his tax return so he would actually pay tax on cash jobs. As children we could have had free lunches at school but dad taught us to keep silent. He felt it was wrong to complain or draw attention to yourself as that is not living by faith. First you must claim what you need and then God will provide. Dad would not hear of us asking for help. I believe that is morally wrong. Children should never suffer. We were not encouraged in school academically or to take part in clubs, sports or extracurricular activities. Dad believed that you should meditate day and night on the word of God. Dad was involved in the building of local `bank when he had a temporary job. On the day the bank was to open they had a clear plexi-glass cubical that cash was going to be blown around in. It was a big event and everyone in town seemed to be there. You had to put your name down and when the name was drawn the person would have 1 minute to get as much cash as they could with the blower going and dollar bills flying all over the place in the cubicle. Dad had prepared for this day by fasting and praying for over a week. Dad spoke about it as though it was going to be him that was called up to be in the cubicle and how he knew the best way to collect the money with the fan whipping the bills around. I remember asking Dad what if someone else's name is called but Dad said that was not having faith to even enter into that discussion and that God knew we needed the money. If you have faith God will bring it to pass. Dad's name was not called that day. On the way home in the pick-up everyone was silent. I asked Dad why his name was not chosen. He said that God must have known that someone else needed it more than we did. I remember looking at him with a bit of a sneer and contempt thinking that he must be a lunatic. Dad also made me terrified that I would be left behind in the rapture as I was always certain I was guilty of something. When I learned about masterbation I was made to pray and ask God to forgive me and was told to save it for my husband. I found it hard to stop and always felt I had to confess my sins to mom or dad. You must confess your sins to one another. I had to pray that my hands could find ""pious things to do"" instead of ""sinful behaviour"". I was also taught that as a woman my position was as a helpmate to my husband. I was to be meek and mild and subservient to my husband. I am just not cut out that way! When my marriage had visible cracks and I was verbally bossy or opinionated to my husband my Dad actually bought and delivered a book to my husband. I was most shocked that he actually b0ught a book as a gift when money is always tight but the book was about Being the leader in your home as God has designed and taking control of your family. I knew my dad was directing that to me. I told my husband that he could read it but he better not get any ideas cause I was not changing and I was subservient to no man. When I left my husband I left my country and live an entire continent away from all of my family now. The distance helps me however as they are my parents I miss them and love them very much. When they need help now I always assist financially and Dad believes it is an answer to prayer. That's okay with me. The repercussions of growing up under scrupulosity follow me through all of my life. I understand dad better since a therapist I saw years ago described him as being ""addicted to religion"" In his heart he is doing the best he can and in that era there was no help. Still, today I am spiritual yet I cannot attend church. I carry a different burden with OCD. Scrupulosity is not one of them.",OCD
45,"It never goes away. It always finds new forms to take.
Sometimes, it's thoughts. Jumping out of my chair, and running like a mad-man to get to the lavatory and come back on time, because the thoughts say that if you don't get back within thirty seconds, your whole family will die. It's illogical, it's irrational, but you can't help it. Your mother wants to know why you keep running out of your seat. You tell her it's because you really need the bathroom, for fear of sounding crazy.
I’ll be sitting in school, doing my work, when a thought tells me, “If you don't fit that whole sentence into one line, your grandmother will die of a heart attack tomorrow.” I know it's stupid, but if you read my book, you can see where my writing has become squished up. I have to obey the thoughts.
Other times, it's washing my hands compulsively. If I touch something that I perceive to be dirty, I feel a ping on my hands. If I touch a wall, I feel my hands ping. The ping stays until I wash my hands. The thoughts tell me, “Don't touch your face, you’ll become ill.” The skin on my hands feel like sand-paper because of it.
Sometimes, it's picking at my skin, to create sores. I can't stop it. Sometimes, I pick at my scalp, other times, I pick at my lips. Sometimes, I do it out of compulsion, other times, I do it unknowingly.
Recently, I noticed that my skin felt a bit smoother, and I realised that I hadn't been washing my hands as much. But, what I also realised, was that I wasn't washing my hands anymore, because I was picking my skin again. Here is what my lips look like.
It's disgusting, it's horrid and I'm deeply ashamed and embarrassed because of it. I wear lip gloss to hide the damage.
But, even though my lips are in a terrible state, the thoughts are much worse.
It's like a screaming match going on in your own mind. Have you ever had a friend, who constantly talks about something that makes you feel uncomfortable? You have to cover your ears and scream, “La la la.” That's what it's like in my head. I can't tell anybody about these thoughts, because I fear that they will come true- if I tell anyone. They cause me a great deal of anxiety, even though I know they're illogical.",OCD
46,"It was hell.
I was raised in a Christian fundamentalist environment (specifically, a Southern Baptist church), and as a result, I believed in fundamentalist Christianity for a long time. Eventually I had doubts about my salvation that wouldn't go away. I'm supposed to have faith. Why couldn't I have faith? I always felt I asked for my salvation wrong or that I would do it wrong if I tried. I had asked to be saved once and even been baptised. Should I be baptised again?
This doubt was the defining feature of my time as a believer. I thought that fundamentalist Christianity was fact, and was rude about it at times. I think my scrupulosity might have been related to my obsession / compulsion to do things the ""right"" way, because I had a total meltdown when I started attending university. I had to study, walk, do everything the ""right"" way or restart until it was done the ""right"" way. Yet the doubt about my own salvation persisted. There was a time I'd actually feel relieved at the end of a church service because I felt not responding to the invitation at the end for people with a desire to be saved somehow bought me another week. By the time I was earning my bachelor degree, that meltdown left me a total wreck. My GPA was bad enough that I couldn't attend the university during the calendar year 1998. That wasn't because of my religious obsessions alone but my OCD in general. That's long enough ago now that, to me, it seems kind of distant and hard to grasp, but at the time it was intense. I still have obsessions about doing things the ""right"" way, though my scrupulosity died that year. I'm not sure how, exactly. I just couldn't function any more that way, and finally did the research needed to move on. My scrupulosity wore itself out. Things are still rough for me, but I'm glad at least that is over.",OCD
47,"When I was suffering from scrupulosity ,I used to have compulsions like- 1) repeatedly praying, 2) saying thankyou to God, 3) confessing to God, 4) avoiding work and preferring prayer, 5) trying to stay away from people under the false belief that I will be closer to God.6) repeatedly looking at God’s photos.Also, I used to feel that I am different from normal people and neglected people’s advice.
Slowly, I changed myself by the following ways-
1) reminding myself that ‘Service to mankind is service to God’
2) I started by being more with family and friends, trying to serve , help and care about them
3) listening and understanding people when they speak
4) trusting God and acknowledging that fulfilling compulsions won't take me closer to God, but a proper mindset would help
5) focusing on work and duties with the aim of community service
6) Accepting the cravings in my mind and impurities in my thoughts, rather than denying them as sinful thoughts because in order to change, we need to first accept them.
These little steps helped me a lot to come out of that disturbed mental state and also resulted in the betterment and happiness of people around me. Curing from this is not about losing faith in God or stopping worship but pursuing God in a better way, and not out of anxiety and compulsions, also resulting in the well-being of you as well as society. Just trust yourself, make little changes and keep going, YOU CAN come out of this mental state👍",OCD
48,"Scrupulosity comes from the fear of abusing or denying belief in God's way of dictating a human life. Most of the times, the fear generated by it has no resemblance to practical life altogether.
Here's an interesting story about my scrupulosity.
I was in my early teens when I first learned about masturbation. I was fond of the new discovery and was keen on trying it multiple times a day. One day, some religious fellow told me that masturbating is a SIN and one would be burned in Hell for doing so. I was a devout religious fellow, and was scared Sh*t of the divine repercussions. I became scrupulous, and I gave up masturbating altogether. It took me some time to realize that masturbating isn't a SIN and I'd never go to Hell for doing it, for the reason that I realized that there's no Heaven, Hell or God.

It's an intense guilt, followed by fear of divine punishment and stress leading to possible depression. I wouldn't term it an OCD for the reason that it is neither obsessive nor compulsive, however, it might make someone a victim of OCD following an event. Scrupulosity comes from fear, and fear is an emotional byproduct.",OCD
49,"I’d never heard of it until recently, but I know exactly what it is, from my years as a priest. Just take the symptoms of ordinary OCD, but with significant obsessions and compulsive behavior or impulses about religious rules and practices, or moral ones. Many priests, and certainly clergy of other denominations, especially ones with lots of rules, are familiar with it. We just called it “scrupulosity.”
THE LECITHIN OBSESSION
Sue felt she had to observe all the teaching of the Catholic church, to the letter. Here’s one. Catholics were asked to avoid meat on Fridays, a gesture of simplicity and humility and self-sacrifice — something like that. Sue not only didn’t eat meat on Fridays, but also on Thursdays and Saturdays, precisely midnight to midnight, just to be sure. She also repeatedly washed and sanitized anything in the kitchen that could have touched meat, just in case a meat molecule remained behind. She frequently phoned the parish priest to be sure she was in compliance, though never much comforted by kind assurances.
One day Sue showed up at the rectory door in a panic. She had just learned about the common food additive lecithin and formed the fear that since this emulsifier was found in both animal and vegetable cells, even though she had been assured by by multiple trips to the library to check — assured that the food additives were derived exclusively from vegetable, not animal sources — it was possible, somehow that there were “meat molecules” lurking hidden in many processed foods. The priests tried to get help for her, but she wasn’t having it.
By this time Sue had decided she couldn’t eat meat on any day, ever, in any from. She also decided that manufacturers couldn’t be trust to list lecithin as an ingredient on labels, or that they’d use some sneaky substitute word.
And on, and on, forever.
There are as many examples as there are folks with OCD. In Sue’s OCD, because she was a strict, conservative Catholic, meat and later lecithin, took on huge importance (along with a few other things). Ultimately, the lecithin obsession was disabling and controlled a lot of her behavior, not just her eating practices.
Sort answer: the severity of the OCD is determined base on how much it interferes with the tasks of daily living, meeting responsibilities, enjoying life. It can be a living hell for some, though psychiatric intervention and behavioral psychotherapy can help, sometimes a great deal.

50,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

All showed regularly good partial success and sometimes full success.
The ‘why’ is in the nature of the beast. OCD occurs under circumstances that come together from all the 3 special fields. Success can come about if just one is addressed and the remainder falls into place thanks to NatURe being a self-repairing system.
So if I’d have to run a clinic (again) and these professionals would work there
a Mayr-Doctor
a Gaps-Practitioner
a Neuro Linguistic Programming therapist
I could manage OCD and ADHD cases with a success rate scratching at the 100% mark.
The hardest bit would be in getting together and then maintaining peace and cooperation in between the prima-donnas = ~ professionals.
As one can get sufficiently informed on each field (books, lectures, courses) I recommend DIY, perhaps with support of family and friends instead of entering a WW3 war-zone or just picking ‘one of the above’!

52,"The two most proven treatments for OCD are, at present, the following:
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy- multiple clinical trials and meta analysis showing CBT superior to sham treatment and superior to psychotherapy in general.
SSRI’s While the efficacy of SSRI’s in the treatment of depression is still a matter of some debate, there is quite strong evidence that medications such as Fluvoxamine, Sertraline and other SSRI’s are superior to placebo in treating OCD. Specifically, while the Serotonin model of depression and OCD is almost certainly oversimplified and incorrect, it is true that antidepressants with minimal effect on Serotonin are rarely helpful in OCD while Serotonin reuptake blockers like Luvox or Anafranil are clearly superior to placebo.
Combination therapy with CBT and SSRI.
Various adjunctive therapies such as CBT plus a NMDA agent such as NAC, or rTMS or adding a small dose of atypical antipsychotic have some modest evidence of efficacy at this time.
The decision of which treatment to use should be based on a collaborative approach with physician and patient, depending on severity of illness, impairment with psychosocial function, personal preference. In general there is no compelling reason to use medications first or vice versa.

53,"Shivaji, violence and war have little to do with aggressive behavior they are evoking.
There must some food you are consuming probably having too much preservative, canned food. After the heavy and mostly cloudy monsoon and now a foggy winter this year you may have grown deficient with Vitamin D3 (lack of sunlight) which may have further aggravated your mental health. Which also leads you aggressive and irritability initially on depleting levels. Having too much synthetic sugar, excessive meat, heavy protein diet, too much caffeine, excessive alcohol, excessive smoking leads to irritability and aggressive behaviors too. Some times the stomach flora and fauna may get destroyed and regenerates due to infections which causes the same.
Check you are in a room which has sufficient sunlight and well ventilated.
Get your Na and Mg salt levels checked. Try avoid high energy or heavy food post sunset. Do you sleep well? Inappropriate and bad food also lead to irritability and aggressive behaviors.
OCD unlike common cold which you contract with single violation, it develops over a period of time.
I think you should dissociate your current quest of knowing (any subject) with OCD. OCD wont let you focus for long or permit you so much freedom reading so much.
It gets pretty much mad when OCD strikes specially during winters.
OCD is ego-dystonic to you will very much know when it strikes.
Pass these little fixes and in case its more overwhelming don’t hesitate to visit your doctor who is able to prescribe mild anti-depressants. If he fails to rectify he may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist accordingly.

54,"It depends.Treatments include pharmacological and non pharmacological.Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay and it is routinely combined with psychotherapy.After the phase of acute illness resolves,Pharmacotherapy is gradually tapered and withdrawan and psychotherapy is continued.Pharmacotherapy has to be given for at least 6 months.",OCD
55,"I have not heard of any natural treatment. Surely somebody down the centuries would have discovered one for this age old disorder. But then it’s true that once you’re on prescribed medicines and therapy, there are some things that you have to do to cure yourself.

Acceptance of obtrusive thoughts is very important, otherwise you’ll keep feeling guilty and distorted. You mustn’t lose your patience because there is hope for you.",OCD
56,"How I controlled mine:
First and foremost, Tell that little voice inside your head that asks you to count numbers and do many irrational things to shove it up. (The voice are not hallucinations but are thoughts).
Ok so now the serious part:
Start learning more and more about anxiety and OCD. The more you learn, the more you know that its irrational. (Not that you already know that, most OCD patients already know that the fears or the obsessions and compulsions are irrational.)
Exposure : Expose yourself to your fears. Face them. This will be really very hard. But you need to do this. (For example, i was terrified of the dark, then i started meditating in a dark room. It was really hard in the beginning but the fear slowly subsided.
track your progress. write them down somewhere.
Do not avoid.
Do not rush and be patient.
3. Manage your stress with the help of breathing exercises, and whatever soothes you, like good music, etc.
4. You need to resist the urge to complete a compulsion.

57,"You are in luck! Treatments for OCD are very effective. The current evidence based practice for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The basic approach is to use some form of systematic desenstization wherein you learn to sit with the negative obsessive thought (i.e., “my hands are dirty”) without engaging in the compulsive behavior (i.e., washing your hands). This is accompanied thought stopping and cognitive rescripting in order challenge and replace the intrusive thought.
Some medications can also be effective, such as SSRIs/SNRIs. Therapy + medication is usually more effective than either one alone. In some acute circumstances your doctor might prescribe benzodiazapines (i.e., valum, clonopin, xanex) to reduce anxiety. If your state has medical cannabis, that can also be helpful in reducing the overall background level of anxiety, which is usually high in OCD patients.
Note**: Obviously when it comes to meds, do what your doctor says, not me. And always consult a health care professional before starting any healthcare intervention.",OCD
58,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
59,"Yes.
Only in your hands. With patience and perseverance. With lots of determination and foresight. You can. Overcome your compulsions and obsession.",OCD
60,"I am not competent about psychiatry but from my experiences, I think it's a complete soul sucker (dementor) sometimes. I can define it as our thoughts taking a role against us. The feeling of the incompleteness of the person who is not already perfect (an example of an oxymoron). It has to be taken under control before it becomes a personality disorder or it will take you under control and it can turn your life into hell.
OCD started showing itself when I was 17-18 years old. I have a perfectionist and obsessive mother. Whatever I do was always incomplete. My way to prove myself with my child mind was my exam successes. I wanted to be appreciated like every child. I hated myself even in the slightest failure. Panic attacks began… I have come to the point where I can get rid of my thoughts only if I kill myself.
I used medication for a while. While at university, my obsessions started which might be considered strange. Symmetry, always sitting in the same place, unable to withstand grammatical errors, not feel comfortable until I remember the name of something, misophonia (especially phone sound like torture), ... The oddest thing is that I felt like I shouldn't finish The Dark Tower series. I still couldn't finish.

Now I gotta think about it. While I try not to think about it. Around and around and around we go, whee!!",OCD
62,"It exists and it’s hell to live with. Things take sooo long to do because if you miss or mess up a step you’ve got to start all over again, or risk a huge panic attack.

63,"OCD is one of the mental health disorders that is most often minimized or dismissed by people who don't have it. They say things like:
“Oh, everybody has OCD”. (No, they don't. Worldwide, the prevalence of OCD is about 1.5%, and in the U.S., it's just over 2%.)
and:
“Just quit worrying so much"". (Oh, thanks, doc, I never thought of that. Hallelujah, I'm cured!)
It's been minimized to the degree that people now commonly use “OCD"" as an adjective meaning orderly or anal-retentive, and there are “fun"" online quizzes like, “how OCD are you?” These quizzes are almost invariably focused on neatness and tidiness, which many people seem to think equate to OCD, when the disorder manifests in various ways. Plenty of people with OCD, myself included, are not obsessive about tidiness and are not germophobes.
Basically, OCD is often seen as a minor, “cute"" disorder. Some people even say they'd like to have it because they'd keep their house cleaner. This completely misunderstands what OCD actually is, and is a slap in the face of people who actually live with the disorder.
There is nothing cute about OCD. It's not fun. People who obsessively clean their houses because of OCD aren't doing it because they like a clean house, they're doing it because of invasive thoughts telling them that something catastrophic will happen if they don't.
Likewise, as a checker, I check my stove and my door locks multiple times before leaving the house because my brain is telling me that the stove is on and the house will burn down, or the door is open and anyone can just walk in, and if those things happen, my life will be in shambles and it will be ALL MY FAULT. It doesn't matter if I know I haven't used the stove since the last time I left the house, and that my rational brain knows the stove is not on. OCD is not rational, and those of us who have it know it's not rational, which only makes it worse, because despite that knowledge, we can't prevent the thoughts and the anxiety they cause.
My obsession with “safe"" and “unsafe” numbers benefits me in no way whatsoever. Counting every step and every sip of water also benefits me in no way whatsoever. Constantly worrying that my house will burn down or be invaded does me no good at all. My obsessive thoughts and brain that refuses to rest bring me little but insomnia; it's very rare for me to get more than five hours of sleep a night, regardless of how tired my body is.
I don't know if “offended"" is the right word. “Annoyed”. “Irritated”. Those might be better. Sometimes I wish I could give all those people who make light of OCD the actual disorder for a week. Then they can tell me how cute it is.",OCD
64,"It never goes away. It always finds new forms to take.
Sometimes, it's thoughts. Jumping out of my chair, and running like a mad-man to get to the lavatory and come back on time, because the thoughts say that if you don't get back within thirty seconds, your whole family will die. It's illogical, it's irrational, but you can't help it. Your mother wants to know why you keep running out of your seat. You tell her it's because you really need the bathroom, for fear of sounding crazy.
I’ll be sitting in school, doing my work, when a thought tells me, “If you don't fit that whole sentence into one line, your grandmother will die of a heart attack tomorrow.” I know it's stupid, but if you read my book, you can see where my writing has become squished up. I have to obey the thoughts.
Other times, it's washing my hands compulsively. If I touch something that I perceive to be dirty, I feel a ping on my hands. If I touch a wall, I feel my hands ping. The ping stays until I wash my hands. The thoughts tell me, “Don't touch your face, you’ll become ill.” The skin on my hands feel like sand-paper because of it.
Sometimes, it's picking at my skin, to create sores. I can't stop it. Sometimes, I pick at my scalp, other times, I pick at my lips. Sometimes, I do it out of compulsion, other times, I do it unknowingly.
Recently, I noticed that my skin felt a bit smoother, and I realised that I hadn't been washing my hands as much. But, what I also realised, was that I wasn't washing my hands anymore, because I was picking my skin again. Here is what my lips look like.
It's disgusting, it's horrid and I'm deeply ashamed and embarrassed because of it. I wear lip gloss to hide the damage.
But, even though my lips are in a terrible state, the thoughts are much worse.
It's like a screaming match going on in your own mind. Have you ever had a friend, who constantly talks about something that makes you feel uncomfortable? You have to cover your ears and scream, “La la la.” That's what it's like in my head. I can't tell anybody about these thoughts, because I fear that they will come true- if I tell anyone. They cause me a great deal of anxiety, even though I know they're illogical.",OCD
65,"Imagine a person wielding a gun.
The gun is made of plastic but somehow you are convinced that it is actually real.
The person then asks you to do what he says and obviously you wouldn’t defy him owing to this belief that the person is wielding a real gun that can infact hurt you.
The man asks of you to go and check the lock for the door — about 50 times.
Then he asks you to check the knobs of the gas stove — about 100 times.
So the strange requests goes on and obviously you would oblige to these requests because you believe that if you don’t do as the person with gun says — you will get hurt.
This is OCD.
When your mind has somehow convinced you that if you don’t perform this compulsions, you can face dire consequences.
Despite the gun is made of plastic and incapable of hurting you yet you are somehow convinced that it is real and if you don’t obey the person who is wielding it — you will eventually get hurt.

66,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD

When I tapped my foot I had to do it a certain number of times with the other one. When I had an itch I counted how many touches or fingers I laid on my skin and did the exact same thing on the other side of me. Every time I touched a pen I would have to click it a number of times until I was satasfied. You get the gist. Mine was i n t e n s e. Like, so bad it hurts to recall. Then, every time I missed a step in my rituals I had a small panic attack. My mouth would dry out and I would constantly whisper, “let me do it again confirm confirm confirm, that didn’t matter, Redo redo, okay confirm.” Like a computer program kind of. I would do that until I felt safe. Some people when they do their rituals are afraid of something bad happening to them. Like a break-in or loss of loved ones. For me it was fire. I would be afraid that my family was going to die in a fire for so long, because on New Years my dad’s truck burned to the ground and we had to get out of the house. You get a lot of anxiety with OCD too, you are just so afraid of what ritual you may have to do next. You could get a mosquito bite and itch like crazy, you could bump a thigh on something or someone and have to awkwardly bump the other.

I have seen him button and unbutton his shirt a thousand times because he did not get it right.
He sits down, get up, smoothen the wrinkles on his pants, sit down again, get up, smoothen things, sit back down, get up again, smoothen some imaginary wrinkles till I make him sit down, hold his hands, and tell him to stop.
Did he stop? Hell no. Dude would do it thousand times just so he could get it right.
But dude! There is no right way to do it. Just stop already.
No, no. There is a way. It is my way. I have to get it right.
Traveling with him is a pain in the ass because he has to get things down to the last details right and in correct manner.
Look at him, going off on a rampage because his OCD freaking kicks in and it is sad to watch him living his life that way but I have got no control over it.
He often rejects going out with other people because people find him weird and wired to all the wrong places.
Dude, we can just hang out at your place. I am cool with it.
Ok, leave your shoes there. Walk this way only. No, no, Alia. Why do you have to step on that?! *goes slightly crazy, takes the mop and mop the spot a thousand times*

70,"OCPD and OCD differ. A lot of people confuse them, even professionals.
Easiest way to sort is:
You might call a OCPD, a jerk or worse because their personality sucks and is controlling. ""My way is the right way"". A personality disorder. They are going to remain that way because it has beliefs behind it. ""It is the only way for people to live, including you. If not, You're stupid.""
OCD is about fear. Not getting the Jaws theme music out of your ears unless you DO something perfectly. More like a superstition. Turn the lock 5 times and then you can move on.

I've listed the common Diagnostic components in the DSM IV
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder is:
A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:
(1) is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost
(2) shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met)
(3) is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)
(4) is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)
(5) is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value
(6) is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things
(7) adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes
(8) shows rigidity and stubbornness
Obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms include both obsessions and compulsions.
A. Either obsessions or compulsions:
Obsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4):
(1) recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress
(2) the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems
(3) the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action
(4) the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion)
Compulsions as defined by (1) and (2):
(1) repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly
(2) the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive
B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children.
C. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships.
D. If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an Eating Disorders; hair pulling in the presence of Trichotillomania; concern with appearance in the presence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder; preoccupation with drugs in the presence of a Substance Use Disorder; preoccupation with having a serious illness in the presence of Hypochondriasis; preoccupation with sexual urges or fantasies in the presence of a Paraphilia; or guilty ruminations in the presence of Major Depressive Disorder).
E. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.",OCD
71,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
72,"The main difference is that OCD involves a person having obsessions and compulsions. They end up performing a task over and over in order to satisfy some anxiety.
A person with OCPD has a personality trait/disorder versus an anxiety disorder. They do not have obsessions or compulsions. Just like any regular person, someone with OCPD may obsess a little over something from time to time, but not extensively or frequently.
OCPD is a whole lot more like a “perfectionist”. However, OCPD is usually perfectionism to an extra level. People with OCPD don't feel bad about it (usually). They are not bothered by obsessions or compulsions, and they see their excessive activities as necessary ways to increase efficiency in their lives.
A good concrete example of the difference?
OCD:
Obsession: fear that they will lose their job, and their family will then suffer, because they are not efficient enough at work.
Compulsive Action: Excessively makes “to do” lists and plans day religiously every morning for 2hrs, to maximize job efficiency, but to such a point that they even lose sight of what they are trying to make more efficient, or in spite of just getting the job done.
OCPD:
Excessively makes lists to maximize efficiency at work. Uses the latest tools and devices to increase efficiency. Etc.
They are not bothered by any of this. They enjoy it. I would definitely call OCPD the less severe in terms of really affecting the individual and causing life problems. However, the main issue with either of these is the rigidness. It will hinder relationships in either case because they will want people to bend to their ways and will usually not take no for an answer, or find compromise.
A person who can easily compromise for others needs, but thinks they have OCPD, is likely just what we would call a typical, “perfectionist” (which has none of the negative connotation of disorder attached to it).",OCD
73,"OCD and OCPD have similar names but they're not the same condition. OCPD is a personality disorder and OCD is an anxiety disorder. Both OCD and OCPD can be diagnosed by a mental health professional using the criteria in the DSM-5..
Differences Between OCPD and OCD
The main difference between these two disorders is that OCD can develop later on in life from certain factors or events, whereas OCPD is a personality disorder that a person is born with.
Those with OCPD have a lot of the same symptoms. But what makes these two disorders different is the fact that individuals with OCPD often lack self-awareness. This means that they're more susceptible to acting on their impulses without realizing them and causing harm to themselves or those around them.
Profound Contrasts
Individuals with OCD are bound to feel restless when explicit things aren't the manner in which they maintain that they should be. Individuals with OCPD are bound to feel irate in the event that things aren't the manner in which they accept they ought to be.
For example, Angie, who experiences OCD, is worried about how the dishes get washed in light of the fact that she feels restless on the off chance that they aren't in any way spotless.
Yet, Arthur, who experiences OCPD, demands that the right thing is to have the whole house all together constantly. Individuals with OCPD might legitimize their endeavors to control by attempting to demonstrate that their way is the correct way. They feel that they are attempting to make the best choice to improve life for everybody, and their endeavors can be useful. Be that as it may, by and large, they might become unbending in their activities, and, in opposition to their inspirations, they can make things more challenging for other people.
Individuals with OCD don't be guaranteed to limit their feelings. Be that as it may, they truly do attempt to control their contemplations (which can go from somewhat awkward to exceptionally upsetting) by doing impulsive things, like dull and formal cleaning and checking.
In any case, individuals with OCPD frequently attempt to get a grip on their feelings along with their current circumstance. They're known for postponing delight. They frequently give need to their work, dismissing connections and their own prosperity. The feelings they are generally mindful of are outrage, disappointment, and hatred. They are more hesitant to be helpless than those with OCD, and may not know about any basic uneasiness.
Angie gets restless assuming that the top is off the toothpaste tube since she fears microorganisms. Arthur blows up on the grounds that it's inappropriate to leave it off.
SHAME OR PRIDE ABOUT THEIR CONDITION
Individuals with OCD could do without their fixations and impulses and eagerly look for help.
Individuals with out and out OCPD, in light of the fact that they make a solid attempt to carry on with their lives as per moral standards, are extremely glad for the manner in which they live and don't comprehend that they have a problem. They will quite often look for help just when compelled to do as such by an accomplice or when they become so discouraged from attempting to live with such requesting norms that they can't go on that way any longer.
Inspirations
Individuals who have OCD are spurred to remain safe and to forestall fiascoes. Individuals with OCPD are more propelled by rules and hairsplitting. While they might legitimize their control by highlighting potential disasters, their hidden inspiration frequently has more to do with needing to keep away from reprimand, fault, or neglecting to satisfy their obligations.
Individuals with OCD are all the more plainly roused to assuage their nervousness. While individuals with OCPD may likewise have basic tension or an apprehension about being deserted, their cognizant concern is that they need to be regarded instead of scrutinized.
BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES
While individuals with OCD may frequently act in an uncertain manner in view of their fixations and impulses, individuals with OCPD might become tyrannical, attempting to conceal their weaknesses from themselves as well as other people.
Individuals who have OCD invest quite a bit of their energy in impulsive customs like cleaning and putting together. Individuals with OCPD invest more energy arranging and working.
OCD endeavors are normally maladaptive, with the exception of to the extent that it assists them with keeping up with great cleanliness. Conversely, some OCPD characteristics can be versatile in a reasonable manner, permitting them to prevail in the external world, regardless of whether it makes them exceptionally despondent. Since they are exceptionally scrupulous, careful, vigorous, and committed, they can make critical commitments in many fields, from craftsmanship to public assistance to bookkeeping. Best entertainers and competitors are urgent somewhat.
DIFFERENCES AMONG COMPULSIVE PERSONALITIES
There are wide varieties in the level of wretchedness among individuals with habitual characters, in light of how controlling, perfectionistic, and unbending they are. Some, who don't actually have OCPD however just have a few impulsive characteristics, have not many maladaptive side effects and can be extremely useful in arranging, coordinating, and finishing things.
Furthermore, there are wide varieties in the style of enthusiastic character: some are oppressive, some are obsessive workers, some are urgent accommodating people, and others are so over the top about getting things on the money that they can't finish anything.

74,"Both sound the same but there are two different disorders falling under two different category.
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder, while obsessive compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder.
Personality disorders are “enduring, patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts”, and “are inflexible and maladaptive, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress”. While Anxiety disorder are “disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat.”
With this I hope you get to know they fall under two different categories of mental disorders.
The criteria for each does differ a lot. (Check out the footnotes for further reference).
Further differences between these two disorders are
OCPD and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are two distinct conditions even though there is some overlap.
OCD patients have insight, while people with OCPD do not.
In OCD they view their thoughts as abnormal, unwanted and distressing. In OCPD they view their way of thinking as normal and beneficial.
A person with OCPD may seek out help from a healthcare professional due to interpersonal problems, but not about their way of thinking or acting.
Thus, the main difference between these two is an OCD patient experience anxiety if the compulsive act isn't performed while an OCPD patient doesn't experience any such anxiety.
The etiology also differs from each other. OCD is usually a result of “Thought-action fusion” and other nurture factors, while OCPD is usually a result of nurture, the way of their up bringing.
The success rate of treatment is high in OCD but very low in OCPD.

75,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

76,"The two disorders are very different but have similar names because Freud believed they were connected. OCD is well named because people with it have obsessions and compulsions that take up time, cause distress and interfere with functioning. People with OCPD don’t have obsessions or compulsions but are rigid, rule bound, so caught in the details they mis the big picture and lose the purpose of an activity. The are likely to think they are right and the rest of the world should be like them. While it is possible to have more than one disorder and many panoply who have one mental disorder will meet criteria for more than one.",OCD
77,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder for me is that when you even don't want or like, but you would do things in a certain way, or do certain things. And the important point here is that you don't feel pleasant or comfortable when you doing that. you are just simply been compelled by an inner force to do that, otherwise, you feel or expect that something horrible would happen. And that fear is based on our repressed experience rather than a rational one. It seems like something had programmed you to behave that way, and that program is in charge of your life. The content of the program is about your unique reacting style in each different situation. (it really far more than tidy or order) Sometimes people call this way a routine that gives us security.
But the essence of this disorder is, you lose lots of amount of control (autonomy) about your life due to this ingrained pattern. Some people see that there is a similarity or deep connection between Compulsion and Addiction. Both of them can make us engage in a certain activity or do things in a certain way. And we are so powerless to control the whole process. But I think the difference is that OCD originates from some repressed deep fear, whereas Addiction is developing from the buried unmet emotional need deep in infancy.
Cause of OCD in my view: our history, especially our childhood experience shapes us that way, in our childhood situation, or the early relationship with our parents. there is some invincible feeling of insecurity pervasive alongside this type of disorder. that means we may feel some threat or uncertainty in our situation when we were so powerless and vulnerable.
We need to adapt to the requirement of the environment or parents to survive if we were not been loved by our parents unconditionally. A child can only be who he truly is when he is been loved and accepted unconditionally, and have our real autonomous emotional development. that's the essence of being the real version of ourselves and truly free and liberating.
But if we haven't been that lucky, then our experience and the environment would mold us in a certain way. That pattern form from that mold is our struggling to survive, and it reflects our survival strategy. And when we are young and still live in the same or similar situation of that mold, then our pattern of reaction or behavior won't bother us so much, because it works and helpful for our daily issue, even though we ain't truly free and autonomous, that means been our trueself. Many people live in a backward and conservative community, for example, a thirty world village or small town, they simply unconscious continue that pattern they develop in their childhood experience all their life. Sometimes they project their inner fear and impotence about their situation to the relationship between nature. And develop a certain way of life-style base on the idea of superstition. And don't label it as a mental problem. I think maybe that's why OCD is usually related to religion.
the hidden fear about some coming threat and the intrusive thought maybe the very similar mental process a religious people had a hundred years ago. And therefore they need the idea of “God” to help them coordinate their chaotic situation.
Now we live in a world of changing, we must sustain all our autonomy to be who we are to make the proper choice or deal with daily work more rationally and efficiently. Then our ingrained pattern and the certain compulsive behavior related to it become our problem and torment us. But awareness is the first step to change, evolve, and heal ourselves. and I am still struggling a little bit, trying to search the roots in my childhood experience and try to liberate myself from this inner prison.",OCD
78,"OCD is known as ego-dystonic--that is, it does not align with values, needs, and goals. This is a distressing disorder often driven by fear.
OCPD is characterized a lot by perfectionism and is considered ego-syntonic. Often, those with OCPD think there is a Right Way to do everything and if everyone in the world just followed what they thought, all would be well. This one is in line with values, needs, and goals, so it feels good to complete some compulsions.
I am a part of two different groups on Facebook: one for OCD and one for OCPD since, when I was first diagnosed, I was told I had OCD tendencies. At a later assessment, I was told that another disorder was covering the reality of OCPD traits, instead. I am not fully convinced that I don't have OCD tendencies, though I am not a professional, trained in identifying these behaviours.
In the OCD group, there is a general feeling of distress and anxiety in most posts, which generally focus on the poster talking about some specific subtype of OCD (i.e., contamination, relationship, harm). In the OCPD group, there is sometimes distress, though I tend to notice it is focused around rigidity issues in relationships and things Not Being Perfect. In the OCPD group, I freely post about silly things like people not eating their food The Right Way and grammar or punctuation errors, whereas I would never do such a thing in the OCD group.
OCD, I believe, has many more brain structure abnormalities and heritable traits than OCPD, though there likely are similar differences in the latter, just in different ways. OCPD, and personality disorders in general, tends to be considered rigid adaptations or responses to environmental demands.
If someone has clarification or confirmation of the claims I have made about OCD, kindly let me know. I love to learn more about psychology in general, and these two disorders in particular.",OCD

BP.... BP will fluctuate automatically.. But in different different levels... Like if some mother whose child is deployed on border.. And a normal women..
Bp level will be difference.. But why?
Because our subconscious mind like memories system know the consequences of war..
Same.. Your consciousness depends on the memories... Every disorder related to subconscious mind.. Because it has duty to serve thoughts like a restaurant..
Your all cells of body depends on the consciousness feeling..
..evert disorders is fault in machine..
Already spirituality has been declared that..
You are “cheetana“and your body is “jadh “
Jadh means no feelings in this body.. Only your consciousness has power to feel..

80,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD
81,"At a basic level. You can look at something that is supposed to be a certain way and not register in your head that you seen it. You need to then reinforce that it actually is there, this can turn into a very strange ritual with counting and prodding and self talk. This can occur maybe only with certain things and situations. Or some new situation can crop up.
This can make task performance at times slow and well nigh impossible. very difficult to do a maths exam if your head is unsure of the calculation you just did all further joined up thinking then takes a back seat.
Sometimes it is worse than others but it can get into the various lifestyle grooves we have on a daily basis and take up many hours in a day .

82,"I was a very ambitious and motivated guy who went to Delhi for JEE coaching. I took admission as a dropper in Resonance Mayur Vihar.
Initially 1–2 months went very well with good score in mock test, good rank and all. My teachers were also very happy from me and i was confident to crack JEE with very good rank but all my hopes shattered once i got to know that I'm suffering from OCD. My test score went down and down and down. From Top 5 to Top 10 to Top 20 and Top 30. I was really panic about my situation. I wasn't able to sleep at night, used to do stupid things like Taking Screenshots of random things…..as random as my home screen too. Right now I'm having around 12000–15000 screenshots of random things.
While studying i used to write the conversation of my friends (when they used to talk). My books, sheets, notes were filled with these conversations more than my study material. But the worst phase of my life i can imagine took place in December. That night i was roaming on my terrace in cold night full of fogg. I was there whole night, called my parents at late night and they were very worried. I decided to leave back to home, but my parents suggested …..as Jan JEE Mains is coming and you have a test in 3–4 days…..after giving your mock you can come but i keep on saying that i have to come. I didn't even had a proper breakfast and came to my home( Around 250 km). I stopped studying around 3 weeks before Jan JEE. I scored 88 percentile🙁🙁🙁. After that this corona came and during lockdown my symptoms increased and i fucked up my September Mains Too with a 92.8 percentile. I also fucked up my JEE Advanced with a score of 97 marks and around 16K rank🙁😶😶.
I decided to go for a third drop and do self study but I'm still not able to study😔😔. I dedicated my 3 years to JEE. Going to an IIT was my biggest dream and it was my passion but OCD fucked up everything. I even thinking of doing suicide many times…..almost every night but some how i used to stop my self. My parents are convincing me by saying you can do MTech but i wanted my UG from an IIT. And it's not about IIT it's about my life, my happiness, everything is shattered very badly.
Sorry for the long answer, i just wanted to write my heart out.
So this was mine story about how OCD Fucked my Ambitions.
Edit :- I got a seat in Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, with my JEE Advanced rank. My compulsions did improved for a short span of time but they're still as worse as past days.

85,"OCD is by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and is most certainly debilitating. OCD isn't wanting to have tables lined up straight. It isn't wanting your pens in colour order. It isn't wanting to have a tidy room. OCD is a debilitating disorder that can take over your life, and is incredibly difficult to recover from.
OCD can manifest itself in so many ways, but it usually revolves around a set of phobias, or obsessions, that usually have a common factor. For me I feel the need to have control over every aspect of my environment in order to keep myself safe. I'm terrified of germs, bugs, and anything where I'm out of control or not myself, such as alcohol or carnival rides. Contact with any of these things used to make me feel overwhelmingly panicked.
It's not simply a matter of having a few phobias and avoiding them. They're called obsessions for a reason. You spend hours of your day thinking about how to avoid every thing that you obsess about. Then the compulsive side comes in. If you come into contact with any of these things that worry you, you then have to something to advert the danger you think you have put yourself in. It's not a choice, in your head it's a matter of life and death, removing this danger is necessary.
By giving into the compulsion you continue the cycle, where the only thing that help a certain obsession is to give into the compulsion. It's incredibly overwhelming, spending hours thinking about how to avoid a certain thing, going out of your way to avoid said thing, then when you inevitably come into contact with it having to do something awful to get rid of the panic.
For me my main obsession was germs. I had to about them at all costs. Otherwise I'd get sick and die. I'd only eat from dishes that had been washed in the dishwasher, because the sink water was filthy. I'd hold glasses up to the light to make sure they were clean. I'd get new cutlery if mine touched the table. I'd refuse to use my drink bottle ever again if anyone else drank from it. I refuse to swim in anything but the ocean. If anyone touched my toothbrush I'd start crying. I wouldn't hold on on the train, because people's dirty hands had touched the railing, instead I'd lean against the door in everyone's way. I had to make all my food fresh myself, so none of the ingredients were off. If I touched anything that worried me I'd scrub my hands with soap. Eventually my hands were cracked and raw from all the soap. I'd refuse physical contact with people, in case they were sick or hadn't washed their hands. This stuff was just the tip of the iceberg.
The social impact is also devastating, as no one wants to spend time with someone who has such intense anxiety around so much. You also drive your friends away, as you don't think they'd be any help. I know I ended up becoming depressed, feeling like so much was wrong with me and I had no one to go to. I'm a teenage girl, and so far I've never been in a relationship. I've been asked out by people I've liked, and I've wanted to ask people out, but if hugging a family member is worrying because of germs, the thought of kissing someone, let alone going any further is absolutely terrifying.
Then there's recovery. In order to recover from OCD you can have talk therapy or medication, often in combination. I was to scared to go on medication because I thought it might impact my thoughts to much and I'd stop being me. A method called cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT, is often used by psychologists. This basically involves exposing yourself to the exact thing that terrifies you in order to make it stop scaring you. Whatever your worst fear is think of it. Imagine having to expose yourself to it every single day, and feel that overwhelming fear that comes with that phobia in order to get better. Medication can help, but in the end without CBT you won't really get better. It's a horrible experience, trying so hard to go against everything your brain is telling you to do.
If you work incredibly hard eventually it does make a difference. You're less overwhelmed, and actually have the time to think about other things. As hard as CBT is, it certainly helps. But despite the fact it gets better you live in constant fear of relapse, of being miserable again, as without constant effort OCD can creep up on you again. And OCD isn't something you cure. It is something you learn to cope with, and work around in your life. You're not trying to get rid of OCD, sadly that's all but impossible, you're trying to get to a point where it doesn't interfere with your day to day happiness.
I hope from this you can see that despite the lack of obvious physical symptoms OCD is most certainly a debilitating disorder, that is able to seriously damage your way of life. And please, whatever you do, don't use OCD to describe your quirks, don't say you're so OCD about your pencils or your wardrobe. Hearing people describe your disorder as if it's a quirk to laugh about is devastating.",OCD

87,"It never goes away. It always finds new forms to take.
Sometimes, it's thoughts. Jumping out of my chair, and running like a mad-man to get to the lavatory and come back on time, because the thoughts say that if you don't get back within thirty seconds, your whole family will die. It's illogical, it's irrational, but you can't help it. Your mother wants to know why you keep running out of your seat. You tell her it's because you really need the bathroom, for fear of sounding crazy.
I’ll be sitting in school, doing my work, when a thought tells me, “If you don't fit that whole sentence into one line, your grandmother will die of a heart attack tomorrow.” I know it's stupid, but if you read my book, you can see where my writing has become squished up. I have to obey the thoughts.
Other times, it's washing my hands compulsively. If I touch something that I perceive to be dirty, I feel a ping on my hands. If I touch a wall, I feel my hands ping. The ping stays until I wash my hands. The thoughts tell me, “Don't touch your face, you’ll become ill.” The skin on my hands feel like sand-paper because of it.
Sometimes, it's picking at my skin, to create sores. I can't stop it. Sometimes, I pick at my scalp, other times, I pick at my lips. Sometimes, I do it out of compulsion, other times, I do it unknowingly.
Recently, I noticed that my skin felt a bit smoother, and I realised that I hadn't been washing my hands as much. But, what I also realised, was that I wasn't washing my hands anymore, because I was picking my skin again. Here is what my lips look like.
It's disgusting, it's horrid and I'm deeply ashamed and embarrassed because of it. I wear lip gloss to hide the damage.
But, even though my lips are in a terrible state, the thoughts are much worse.
It's like a screaming match going on in your own mind. Have you ever had a friend, who constantly talks about something that makes you feel uncomfortable? You have to cover your ears and scream, “La la la.” That's what it's like in my head. I can't tell anybody about these thoughts, because I fear that they will come true- if I tell anyone. They cause me a great deal of anxiety, even though I know they're illogical.",OCD

In summary, people with obsessive-compulsive disorder often have thoughts or things that compel themselves to do, that cause them suffering but are difficult to ignore or get out of their mind.

Therefore, if you suspect yourself or a loved one has signs of depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder, the patient should seek help and advice from a doctor to get treatment and avoid bad consequences. disease caused.",OCD
89,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

90,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
91,"You are not your mind, your thoughts, or your senses, you are the one in control of them, they are the ones influencing you to do karma in this world.
Spiritual thought, isn't it?
Wait.
I will give you a perspective.
It's midnight, you went to the kitchen to get some hot water, you switched on the stove, and after putting the water in the jug, you switched off the stove.
Wait, did you switch it off?
What if it isn't switched off?
Certain death for the one who lights the stove in the morning.
You check it again. It's shut.
Your mind refuses to believe your eyes, wisdom and sensory inputs.
What if this is the on-button and not the off-button? Your basics get shattered.
You switch it on again and then switch it off and confirm the off button.
Wait, did I switch it off or not? Your mind brings another thought.
You keep repeating the act out of fear and confusion.
How did you manage to defy a simple logic?
It's powerful negative thoughts.
You are reacting to the negative thoughts and not on logic, facts or your input receptors.
How to correct yourself?
Say to yourself-
“This is the correct way to shut the stove, I did it right now. There's no gas or flame now, I am done. Any insecure confused thought is the negative child born out of my mind. These thoughts are compulsive and incorrect, not my actions, I trust my actions. There's no threat.”
You would still have some doubts at that moment, but when you practice this habit, you slowly numb these thoughts.
The critical points here are-
Recognizing the completion, the end, I did it, it's complete now, no need to check or repeat any further. Whenever you complete any task, keep your focus on the endpoint and realise that you did it, you can say that to yourself and feel relaxed.
Recognising thoughts as compulsive thoughts and not the wisdom of your mind. “I have OCD and these thoughts are a result of it, they are false and trying to conquer my mind, I should let them pass and believe in reality and my acts.” Once you learn to differentiate, you recognise and keep yourself separate from such thoughts, they would cause the anxious fight or flight response, but if you are clear and determined, they slowly fade away and you can focus on other things. The more you practise lower the potency of these thoughts becomes.
Reducing fear in your mind. Accepting death as the ultimate reality, accepting diseases, mistakes and losses as an inseparable part of life, having faith in your ability to cope with the downs of life, and realizing that bad events are not the factory settings of life, they are not prominent than normal or good events, live a little casual and free life. You can afford to not be perfect.
Try to identify yourself as the wisdom controlling your life, and stay separate from the body, life, world and your mind and thoughts, you have to control them or they shall control you. Controlling them is really difficult and needs practice and momentary suffering in form of anxiety or panic, but it's for the overall betterment of your life. Start the pursuit to conquer your mind now.
Don't feel shy or delay. Get professional treatment if it's getting over your mind.

92,"Came back to quora for a brief time, so I’m gonna give out the steps that are brutal, effective and painfully grinding.
OCD can be very subtle, or very obvious. It depends.
But it all has the same pattern. You use compulsions to calm your anxiety from your obsession. It’s an anxiety reducing behavior, mental or physical, automatic or completely conscious. Once you stop committing them, OCD goes away. It’s that simple. Except it’s not.
My first and utmost important advice - never, ever google. You are wasting your precious, limited time. Do not look up OCD on the internet. It gives your obsessions power, like they are something meaningful. “How do I learn to overcome it then?” Find an OCD-specialized therapist, or if not able to look up cognitive-behavioral therapy. Regardless, I’m gonna present the main jist to combating it. Second advice: Reflect on your compulsions. This can take a long time, don’t worry about it. What do you do to reduce your anxiety? It can be something veery automatic or subtle as I said. Find it, bring it to awareness, and don’t do it anymore. Third advice: Don’t think about how long anxiety lasts. It will go away.
Example: Obsessive thought -> Notice it, acknowledge it as a thought, “Oh, an obsessive thought.” go on about your life like it never happened, just as any other thought -> Be fine with anxiety, no MATTER how long it lasts. Do NOT slip into anxiety reducing behavior. Do not tell yourself you are gonna be fine. Do not tell yourself it’s gonna go away. Do not take medications - unless you REALLY have to, then take them just to get back on track. Do not try to stop it. It’s anxiety, that’s what it is. If you compulse again, don’t be harsh on yourself. Train your brain not to do it, it takes time. A LOT of it.
Fourth advice: Grind it ‘till you make it - it can last anywhere from a few days, weeks, or even months. Then it goes away. This can be extremely hard, as anxiety will strike you like it has never before - push through.
Fifth advice: It might resurface as many other forms of OCD during times of great stress. The process is the same. The beauty of OCD is that it has one simple cure, no matter which shape or form it takes.
Sixth and final advice: Rumination is a compulsion. Arguing with your obsessions is a compulsion. Trying to disprove your obsessions is a compulsion. Responding to your obsessions is a compulsion. Anything that gives cognitive meaning to your obsessions is a compulsion, as it desperately tries to classify the irrelevant thought to solve it or normalize it. Get rid of it.
It’s hellish and takes a long time and torture, but you’ll come out as a big damn winner after this. Finally realizing the thoughts have no power over you is an AMAZING feeling, well worth the time. Do not give your OCD power over your life. It’s an aspect of your personality, just THAT, and NOTHING more. Fight for recovery, and you’ll get it.",OCD
93,"I’m finding my own way out of the compulsive and intrusive thoughts, more of OCPD. I’d suggest not to take these tips on face value alone.
Do not stay in bed for long. It’s a trap, it’ll leave you alone with thoughts for longer time. GET OUT OF YOUR BED
When you feel the compulsive urge of doing something taking over- shut your eyes, squeeze a piece of paper. Throw it out. Go out for a walk. Do not give in to the urges, it’s not worth it
Have a routine that you stick to: Not a routine that’s absolutely inflexible, but one that includes some of your best interests. Mine is making coffee, reading something, writing something, sitting with my breakfast near a window.
Whenever you feel you are losing your mind - Remind yourself of you. The real you. Look at old pictures of you, look at the human you were - the fierce young soul you were. And you are that - no matter what your mind is tricking you into
For the love of hell and heaven, please workout heavily. Join a gym if you want, please start shaking your body to senses.
Eat a very good diet. Your diet rules everything. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT mess with your food
Take a bath in the first hour or two of waking up. Feel fresh and confident
Change your wardrobe to a more confident, yet comfortable clothing style
Meditate for a while. It helps a lot. It helps you to calm down.
Pray - That’s something you can do your own way. But it’s always okay to ask universe to send some help.
Train your brain to do better than this. Take absolute control over your brain again - remember, nobody can get away by tricking you; not even your own brain. Take control of the thoughts.
You are not crazy. It’s all right. You are absolutely amazing.",OCD
94,"I do not know your situation, nor if you truly do suffer from OCD, or some other disorder. I am not a psychologist, and what I am saying should not be construed as medical advice. But I'll share with you how I overcame it, and hopefully that will be enlightening.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is what made my symptoms minimize nearly to nothing.
I was driving my my head through a wall (figuratively) as well as my fists and feet (literally) trying to figure out how to stop the intrusive thoughts from taking over my life from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning, to the moment I fell asleep at night. Sometimes, the thoughts and obsessions manifested themselves in my dreams as well.
It took me 7 years of being locked in my room, failing through classes in high school, dodging social interactions and professional duties, trying with every ounce of strength I had to straighten my mind out, before I realized there was a fundamentally simple answer to the problem:
I was pushing, where I should have been pulling.
It sounds like an enigmatic answer, but it is the one that best fits the solution to my particular set of issues with OCD. I spent every waking moment of my day repressing. Pushing away horrific thoughts of violence and socially unacceptable scenarios that seemed to pop into my head at random intervals throughout the day. If you are suffering from OCD, I'm sure you don't need me to tell you the mental energy spent on keeping these thoughts at bay. I was pushing with everything I had.
Eventually I saw a therapist, who helped me try a new tactic. She had me sit down, and for an hour a day, with no outside distractions or noises, close my eyes and will the thoughts to me. She told me to welcome the thoughts in. To become okay with them. To usher them into my head, instead of waiting for them to do so. To mentally envelope myself in that which I once found repulsive. To essentially pull, where I had pushed.
The results were tangible after the first hour of employing this tactic. I felt a lightness in my head I hadn't felt since I was a child. It was as though the stress of intrusive thoughts was still there, but only as an echo. That which we are constantly exposed to becomes commonplace. And that which becomes commonplace, loses its ability to horrify us.
The intrusive thoughts came back, of course. But not as intensely. I continued to do the exercise daily, seeing stronger results each time I did so, until the thoughts became so inconsequential that I hardly noticed they were there in my daily life. I became so good at the exercise, that I started to make it comedic, and soon, what once kept me anxiously holed up in my room became something I could sincerely laugh at. That turnaround was one of the best feelings I had felt in years.
I still feel echoes of OCD from time to time. It manifests itself slightly differently, but I recognize it all the same. I sometimes fall into bouts of unrealistic anxiety. I always fall back on that exercise, and it hasn't failed me yet.
I grew up thinking that those seven years of torture were going to be my life. Now I know that that's not the case. I always thought I was alone in that fight, that no one else was experiencing what I was. It would have helped me so much if I could have had someone who understood this thing, to be there for me and tell me that it didn't have to be that way.
Seek help from a cognitive behavioral therapist. Reach out to a community who understands it. Don't give up hope.",OCD
95,"I'm speaking from experience here.
My journey with OCD started when I was a teenager. At first, it seemed like harmless habits – checking the door lock multiple times and arranging my belongings in a certain order. My parents were so happy that I was so particular about cleanliness and kept not only my room but the entire house clean. But soon, I realized this was more than just cleanliness.
I tried to hide this from others, my family, my friends and even my girlfriend. But deep down, I knew I needed help.
So the turning point came when I finally mustered the courage to seek therapy. Opening up about my OCD was terrifying, but it was also liberating. For the first time, I felt understood and supported. My therapist helped me finally understand who I was and what I was going through.
But recovery wasn't easy. It took time. There were moments when I wanted to give up when everything felt so unbearable. But I refused to lose myself again. I clung to the glimmer of hope that things could get better, even when I thought they wouldn’t.
Slowly but surely, I began to feel more “normal” again.
3 major learnings I had from therapy is - To challenge my thoughts and recognize them for what they were – false thoughts.
And practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques every single day without a miss to calm myself.
Perhaps the most crucial learning was to accept myself, flaws and all. I realized that having OCD didn't make me broken or defective – it made me human.
Today, I can proudly say that I've made peace with my OCD. I still have it, but it no longer consumes me or my life.",OCD

Every time I got triggered, instead of trying to run away from that experience with a compulsion, I reminded myself of the following:
1. I am beyond all this. (An example with an analogy here) What's happening in my mind and body now is nothing more than the execution of programs in a computer. I can change those programs by simply realizing that I am equivalent to the electricity that enables them, and not the programs themselves. I can stop here, and flow where I want to go. See where I want to see, and BE where I want to be.
2. Awareness is the actual truth, and the present moment is the only reality. Now is the only way out of this, so I am choosing that way.
3. God has created nothing ugly or unpleasant. I do not deny that my direct experience is totally unpleasant, but I believe in the larger truth that God has only created goodness. I believe and know that God is with me here, loving me infinitely and helping me overcome this.
4. (Now this is when you can distance yourself from yourself a little and talk to that part of you which is suffering) ""Oh my baby, the part of me that's feeling unbearable... I am with you dear... I acknowledge you... I love you... you're so pure, and nothing can happen to you. I am with you always, and no one else can understand you as much as I do."" Showing self-love, self compassion... tbh this is what helped me the most.
It is more of a realization than belief that “I am beyond a body-mind.” I have shared the smaller portion of my own very large reddit post here (in case someone calls this answer plagiarized.)
There's much more to what is called God, Awareness or the present moment here. The whole thing was an inner experience instead of a belief in an authoritative entity. I had a moment of epiphany which started me on this process of not just my own personal recovery from a myriad of mental disorders, but also of understanding a lot more in life - my own loved ones, family and friends, job and passion, in essence… my real self. It was literally like waking up from a nightmare of years only to find that it was all but an illusion, and the beauty of life is waiting to be experienced, right here, right now.
My reddit post was much much longer, and far more emotional. I don't wish to share that much here for the most obvious reasons: my loved ones are here on Quora, and I am already anonymous on reddit. If you wish to see that post, DM me.
I hope this helps. My best wishes for your recovery!",OCD
97,"BUCKLE UP BECAUSE YOU ARE ABOUT TO KNOW SOMETHING AMAZING
I suffered from OCD for more than 4 years with a very high severity, and I must tell you, there is no fixed way to treat OCD. Most people try a common method only but that is not how I overcame it.
IF YOU WANT A PROPER WAY TO OVERCOME IT, here it is.
OCD started to dominate me back in 2018 when I knew a little about this disorder. Because I was very sensitive about my hygiene, morality, and religion, OCD saw an opportunity to grab on those things. Despite having a determination for wonderful dreams and goals, I started struggling.
I became a slave to feelings and urges. Allowing them to dictate me when I was studying, working, reading, and doing other life activities. The HUGE BOMBS of intrusive thoughts often created a HIGH LEVEL of anxiety, leaving me to question my own beliefs and thoughts.
Even though I knew I had OCD, I just couldn’t stop contemplating those distressing thoughts. Rumination, reassurance, and avoidance became a daily part of my life. I was BURNING inside. I tried resisting compulsions in a lot of ways that exhausted me to the point where sometimes I almost cried.
I did not want to take therapy or medications because I didn't want to ‘manage’ my OCD and be in the belief that intrusive thoughts could attack me anytime and I had to take help of some coping techniques or medicines to help against it.
No. Absolutely, No.
Instead, I wanted my mind to automatically ignore those intrusive thoughts and urges so that I could live, play, enjoy, and do things without interruption. I wanted myself to be unbothered by those thoughts.
I knew resisting compulsion was the key and I wanted to do it, but not with a limiting amount of beliefs and actions (e.g. - practice exposure). I wanted to know what people all around the world are doing in this, and what other strategies or practices OCD sufferers from different places are applying to control themselves doing compulsions.
There had to be something that could help me that could be effective enough to make me live in peace and control.
Then one day, while looking for some help online, I came across a counselor from the Middle East who was addressing OCD situations in his clients, in a very smart way.
He was not telling them to do exposures or take medications that most people from the West and other developed countries do, instead, he was just making people see what was going on with them and what they had to focus on to let those intrusive thoughts pass without engaging in compulsions.
I tried this, and it didn't show instant results but after some time it started working. His clients were also getting better using this way. My OCD severity level reduced a lot, but it didn't get to the point where I was doing every activity without any interruption. Some amount of difficulty in resisting compulsions was still there.
I wanted to make my mind unbeatable against OCD.
Then, I studied psychology and observed in-depth human thinking and behavior, in which I tried a mindset strategy coupled with the counselor one with some important techniques that I learned along the way in my OCD journey. AND IT CHANGED EVERYTHING.
After applying it regularly, my OCD severity level reduced so much in such a short amount of time, that there came a time when one day Intrusive thoughts and urges didn't even bother me. They just came and went away like passing clouds, while I was doing my work without taking any action on them. As a result, my anxiety decreased to almost nothing.
Today, I can’t explain the feeling. The control and peace that I was trying hard for have finally been rewarded.
I can live, study, read, have fun, spend time with friends, families, and loved ones, and work on my goals without any interruption.
Now, my goal is to help all OCD sufferers all around the world to achieve recovery, and with recovery, I do not mean, trying some form of common coping techniques, when they get attacked with distressing thoughts, instead helps them develop themselves to the point where OCD don’t even bother to mess with them and they can live their life to the fullest.
Therefore, I created a 3-step Method from my experience in which I have explained how you can go from your current situation to the point where you can live your life the way you want.
What is amazing about this method is that you can apply this regardless of your OCD theme or your current treatment.
Also, this method does not focus on the problem, but on an effective way to solve it.
I hope you recover soon with this and I’ll be happy to help you if needed.

98,"Very Long Answer ahead but worth reading
OCD ( Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ) is a serious psychological condition in which a person suffering from it loses control over his own thoughts and perform some rituals or same actions repeatedly. This makes his life so miserable that the person can even endeavour to commit suicide sometimes.
What causes OCD ? : Medical Science is not quite sure about the cause of OCD. But, some studies suggest that this is caused by low amount of Serotonin ( a type of neurotransmitter) in the patient’s brain.
So without wasting any time let’s come to the main point-How to overcome OCD ?
BELOW ARE THE 4 STEPS TO OVERCOME OCD. THESE STEPS ARE TAKEN FROM Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz's FAMOUS BOOK ON OCD: BRAIN LOCK.
This book has helped thousands of OCD patients to get rid of it. I would highly recommend you to read this book.
Step 1: Relabel
Step 2: Reattribute
Step 3: Refocus
Step 4: Revalue
The goal is to perform these steps daily. (The first three steps are especially important at the beginning of treatment.) Self-treatment is an essential part of this technique for learning to manage your responses to OCD on a day-to-day basis. Let's begin by learning the Four Steps.
Step 1: Relabel
The critical first step is to learn to recognize obsessive thoughts and compulsive urges. You don't want to do this in a merely superficial way; rather, you must work to gain a deep understanding that the feeling that is so bothersome at the moment is an obsessive feeling or a compulsive urge. To do so, it is important to increase your mindful awareness that these intrusive thoughts and urges are symptoms of a medical disorder.
Whereas simple, everyday awareness is almost automatic and usually quite superficial, mindful awareness is deeper and more precise and is achieved only through focused effort. It requires the conscious recognition and mental registration of the obsessive or compulsive symptom. You should literally make mental notes, such as, 'This thought is an obsession; this urge is a compulsive urge."" You must make the effort to manage the intense biologically mediated thoughts and urges that intrude so insistently into consciousness. This means expending the necessary effort to maintain your awareness of what we call the Impartial Spectator, the observing power within us that gives each person the capacity to recognize what's real and what's just a symptom and to fend off the pathological urge until it begins to fade and recede.
The goal of Step 1 is to learn to Relabel intrusive thoughts and urges in your own mind as obsessions and compulsions~and to do so assertively. Start calling them that; use the labels obsession and compulsion. For example, train yourself to say, ""I don't think or feel that my hands are dirty. I'm having an obsession that my hands are dirty."" Or, ""I don't feel that I have the need to wash my hands. I'm having a compulsive urge to perform the compulsion of washing my hands."" (The technique is the same for other obsessions and compulsions, including compulsive checking of doors or appliances and needless counting.) You must learn to recognize the intrusive, obsessive thoughts and urges as OCD.
In the Relabeling step, the basic idea is: Call an obsessive thought or compulsive urge what it really is. Assertively Relabel it so you can begin to understand that the feeling is just a false alarm, with little or no basis in reality. As the result of much scientific research we now know that these urges are caused by biological imbalances in the brain. By calling them what they really are--obsessions and compulsions--you begin to understand that they do not really mean what they say. They are simply false messages coming from the brain.
It is important to remember that just Relabeling these thoughts and urges won't make them go away. In fact, the worst thing you can do is to try to make them vanish. It won't work because the thoughts and urges have a biological cause that is beyond your control. What you can control is your behavioral response to those urges. By Relabeling, you begin to understand that no matter how real they feel, what they are saying is not real. The goal: to learn to resist them.
Recent scientific research on OCD has found that by learning to resist obsessions and compulsions through behavior therapy, you can actually change the biochemistry that is causing
the OCD symptoms. But keep in mind that the process of changing the underlying biological problem, and by doing so changing the urge itself, may take weeks or even months. It requires patience and persistent effort. Trying to make these thoughts and urges go away in seconds or minutes will cause only frustration, demoralization, and stress. It will, in fact, tend to make the urges worse. Probably the most important thing to learn in this behavioral treatment is that your responses to the thoughts and urges are within your control, no matter how strong and bothersome they may be. The goal is to control your responses to the thoughts and urges, not to control the thoughts and urges themselves.
The next two steps are designed to help you learn new ways to control your behavioral responses to OCD symptoms.
Step 2: Reattribute
The key to our self-directed behavioral therapy approach to treating OCD can be summed up in one sentence: ""It's not me--it's my OCD."" That is our battle cry. It is a reminder that OCD thoughts and urges are not meaningful, that they are false messages from the brain. Self-directed behavior therapy lets you gain a deeper understanding of this truth.
You are working toward a deep understanding of why the urge to check that lock or why the thought that ""my hands are dirty"" can be so powerful and overwhelming. If you know the thought makes no sense, why do you respond to it? Understanding why the thought is so strong and why it won't go away is the key to increasing your willpower and enabling you to fight off the urge to wash or check.
The goal is to learn to Reattribute the intensity of the thought or urge to its real cause, to recognize that the feeling and the discomfort are due to a biochemical imbalance in the brain. It is OCD--a medical condition. Acknowledging it as such is the first step toward developing a deeper understanding that these symptoms are not what they seem to be. You learn not to take them at face value.
Deep inside the brain lies a structure called the caudate
nucleus. Scientists worldwide have studied this structure
and believe that, in people with OCD, the caudate nucleus
may be malfunctioning. Think of the caudate nucleus as a
processing center or filtering station for the very
complicated messages generated by the front part of the
brain, which is probably the part used in thinking, planning,
and understanding. Together with its sister structure, the
putamen, which lies next to it, the caudate nucleus functions
like an automatic transmission in a car. The caudate nucleus
and the putamen, which together are called the striatum,
take in messages from very complicated parts of the brain--
those that control body movement, physical feelings, and
the thinking and planning that involve those movements and feelings. They function in unison like an automatic transmission, assuring the smooth transition from one behavior to another.
Typically, when anyone decides to make a movement, intruding movements and misdirected feelings are filtered out automatically so that the desired movement can be performed rapidly and efficiently. There is a quick, smooth shifting of gears.
During a normal day, we make many rapid shifts of behavior, smoothly and easily and usually without thinking about them. It is the functioning of the caudate nucleus and the putamen that makes this possible. In OCD, the problem seems to be that the smooth, efficient filtering and the shifting of thoughts and behavior are disrupted by a glitch in the caudate nucleus.
As a result of this malfunction, the front of the brain becomes overactive and uses excessive energy. It's like having your car stuck in a ditch. You spin and spin and spin your wheels, but without traction you can't get out of that ditch. With OCD, too much energy is being used in a frontal part of the brain called the orbital cortex. It's as if the orbital cortex, which has an error- detection circuit, becomes stuck in gear. This is probably why OCD causes people to get a ""something is wrong"" feeling that won't go away. You have to do the work to get it out of gear-- to shift the gears. You have a manual, rather than an automatic, transmission. In fact, the person with OCD has a sticky manual transmission; he or she must shift the gears. This takes great effort because the brain tends to get ""stuck in gear."" But, whereas an automobile transmission is made of metal and can't fix itself people with OCD can teach themselves how to shift gears through self-directed behavior therapy. In doing so, they can actually fix this broken gearshift in the brain. We now know that you can change your own brain biochemistry.
The key to the Reattribute step is to realize that the awful intrusiveness and ferocious intensity of OCD thoughts are due to a medical condition. Underlying problems in brain biochemistry are causing these thoughts and urges to be so intrusive. That is why they won't go away. By doing this Four-Step Method of self-directed behavior therapy, you can change the brain's biochemistry. This takes weeks or even months of hard work. In the meantime, understanding the role the brain plays in OCD thoughts and urges will help you to avoid one of the most demoralizing and destructive things people with OCD almost invariably do: the frustrating attempt to ""get rid of"" the thoughts and urges. There is nothing you can do to make them go away immediately. But remember: You don't have to act on them. Don't take them at face value. Don't listen to them. You know what they are. They are false messages from the brain that are due to a medical condition called OCD. Use this knowledge to avoid acting on them. The most effective thing you can do something that will help you change your brain for the better in the long run--is to learn to put these thoughts and feelings aside and go on to the next behavior. This is what we mean by shifting gears: Do another behavior. Trying to make them go away will only pile stress on stress--and stress just makes OCD thoughts and urges worse.
Using the Reattribute step will also help you to avoid performing rituals in a vain attempt to ""get the right feeling"" (for example, a sense of ""evenness"" or a sense of completion). Knowing that the urge to get that ""right feeling"" is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the brain, you can learn to ignore the urge and move on. Remember, ""It's not me--it's my OCD."" By refusing to listen to the urge or to act on it, you will actually change your brain and make the feeling lessen. If you take the urge at face value and act on it, you may get momentary relief but within a very short time the urge will just get more intense. This is perhaps the most important lesson that
people with OCD must learn. It will help you avoid being the ""sucker"" and taking the false bait of OCD every time.
The Relabel and Reattribute steps are usually performed together to bring about a deeper understanding of what is really happening when an OCD thought or urge causes you such intense pain. You Relabel it, call it what it is--an obsession or a compulsion. Use mindful awareness to get beyond a superficial understanding of OCD and to gain the more profound understanding that the thoughts and urges are nothing more than fallout from a medical condition.
Step 3: Refocus
The Refocus step is where the real work is done. In the beginning, you may think of it as the ""no pain, no gain"" step. Mental exercise is like a physical workout. In Refocusing, you have work to do: You must shift the gears yourself. With effort and focused mindfulness, you are going to do what the caudate nucleus normally does easily and automatically, which is to let you know when to switch to another behavior. Think of a surgeon scrubbing his hands before surgery: The surgeon doesn't need to wait for a timer to go off to know when it's time to stop scrubbing. After a while, the behavior is simply automatic. After a while he gets a ""feel"" for when he's scrubbed enough. But people with OCD can't get the feeling that something is done once it's done. The automatic pilot is broken. Fortunately, doing the Four Steps can usually fix it.
In Refocusing, the idea is to work around the OCD thoughts and urges by shifting attention to something else, if only for a few minutes. Early on, you may choose some specific behavior to replace compulsive washing or checking. Any constructive, pleasant behavior will do. Hobbies are particularly good. For example, you may decide to take a walk, exercise, listen to music, read, play a computer game, knit, or shoot a basketball.
When the thought comes, you first Relabel it as an obsessive thought or a compulsive urge and then Reattribute it to the fact that you have OCD--a medical problem. Then Refocus your attention to this other behavior that you have chosen. Start the process of Refocusing by refusing to take the obsessive-compulsive symptoms at face value. Say to yourself, ""I'm experiencing a symptom of OCD. I need to do another behavior.""
You must train yourself in a new method of responding to the thoughts and urges, redirecting your attention to something other than the OCD symptoms. The goal of treatment is to stop responding to the OCD symptoms while acknowledging that, for the short term, these uncomfortable feelings will continue to bother you. You begin to ""work around"" them by doing another behavior. You learn that even though the OCD feeling is there, it doesn't have to control what you do. You make the decision about what you're going to do, rather than respond to OCD thoughts and urges as a robot would. By Refocusing, you reclaim your decision-making power. Those biochemical glitches in your brain are no longer running the show.
The Fifteen-Minute Rule
Refocusing isn't easy. It would be dishonest to say that dismissing the thoughts and urges and moving on does not take significant effort and even tolerance of some pain. But only by learning
to resist OCD symptoms can you change the brain and, in time, decrease the pain. To help you manage this task, we have developed the fifteen-minute rule. The idea is to delay your response to an obsessive thought or to your urge to perform a compulsive behavior by letting some time elapse--preferably at least fifteen minutes--before you even consider acting on the urge or thought. In the beginning or whenever the urges are very intense, you may need to set a shorter waiting time, say five minutes, as your goal. But the principle is always the same: Never perform the compulsion without some time delay. Remember, this is not a passive waiting period. It is a time to perform actively the Relabeling, Reattributing, and Refocusing steps. You should have mindful awareness that you are Relabeling those uncomfortable feelings as OCD and Reattributing them to a biochemical imbalance in the brain. These feelings are caused by OCD; they are not what they seem to be. They are faulty messages coming from the brain.
Then you must do another behavior~any pleasant, constructive behavior will do. After the set period has lapsed, reassess the urge. Ask yourself if there's been any change in intensity and make note of any change. Even the smallest decrease may give you the courage to wait longer. You will be learning that the longer you wait, the more the urge will change. The goal will always be fifteen minutes or more. As you keep practicing, the same amount of effort will result in a greater decrease in intensity. So, in general, the more you practice the fifteen-minute rule, the easier it gets. Before long, you may make it twenty minutes or thirty minutes or more.
It's What You Do That Counts
It is vitally important to Refocus attention away from the urge or thought and onto any other reasonable task or activity. Don't wait for the thought or feeling to go away. Don't expect it to go away right away. And, by all means, don't do what your OCD is telling you to do. Rather, engage in any constructive activity of your choosing. You'll see that instigating a time delay between the onset of the urge and even considering acting on it will make the urge fade and change. What is more important, even if the urge changes hardly at all, as sometimes happens, you learn that you can have some control over your response to this faulty message from the brain.
This application of mindful awareness and the Impartial Spectator will be empowering to you, especially after years of feeling at the mercy of a bizarre and seemingly inexplicable force. The long-range goal of the Refocus step is, of course, never again to perform a compulsive behavior in response to an OCD thought or urge. But the intermediate goal is to impose a time delay before performing any compulsion. You're learning not to allow OCD feelings to determine what you do.
Sometimes the urge will be too strong, and you will perform the compulsion. This is not an invitation to beat yourself up. Keep in mind: As you do the Four Steps and your behavior changes, your thoughts and feelings will also change. If you give in and perform a compulsion after a time delay and an attempt to Refocus, make a special effort to continue to Relabel the behavior and to acknowledge that this time the OCD overwhelmed you. Remind yourself ""I'm not washing my hands because they are dirty, but because of my OCD. The OCD won this round, but next time I'll wait longer."" In this way, even performing a compulsive behavior can contain an element of behavior therapy. This is very important to realize: Relabeling a
compulsive behavior as a compulsive behavior is a form of behavior therapy and is much better than doing a compulsion without making a clear mental note about what it is.
A tip for those who are fighting checking behaviors--checking locks, stoves, and other appliances: If your problem is, say, checking the door lock, try to lock the door with extra attention and mindful awareness the first time. This way, you'll have a good mental picture to refer to when the compulsive urge arises. Anticipating that the urge to check is going to arise in you, you should lock the door the first time in a slow and deliberate manner, making mental notes, such as ""The door is now locked. I can see that the door is locked."" You want a clear mental image of that locked door; so when the urge to check the door seizes you, you will be able to Relabel it immediately and say, ""That's an obsessive idea. It is OCD."" You will Reattribute the intensity and intrusiveness of the urge to check again to your OCD. You will remember, ""It's not me--it's just my brain.""
You will Refocus and begin to ""work around"" the OCD urges by doing another behavior, with a ready mental picture of having locked that door because you did it so carefully and attentively the first time. You can use that knowledge to help you Refocus actively on doing another behavior, even as you Relabel and Reattribute the urge to check that has arisen, as you anticipated it would.
Keeping a Journal
It is important to keep a behavior-therapy journal as a record of your successful Refocusing efforts. It need not be anything fancy. The idea is simply to have a written record to remind you of your successes in self-directed behavior therapy. The journal is important because you can refer back to it to see which behaviors most helped you to Refocus. But--and this is equally important--it helps you to build confidence as you see your list of achievements grow. In the heat of battle against a compulsive urge, it isn't always easy to remember which behavior to Refocus on. Keeping a journal will help you to shift gears when the going gets tough, when the obsessive thought or compulsive urge heats up, and will train your mind to remember what has worked in the past. As your list of successes gets longer, it will be inspirational.
Record only your successes. There is no need to record your failures. You have to learn to give yourself a pat on the back. This is something people with OCD need to learn to do more of. Make sure to give yourself encouragement by consciously acknowledging your successful use of Refocusing behaviors as a job well done. Reinforce that success by recording it in your behavior- therapy journal and giving yourself a little reward, even if it's only to tell yourself how terrific you are for working so hard to help yourself.
Step 4: Revalue
The goal of the first three steps is to use your knowledge of OCD as a medical condition caused by a biochemical imbalance in the brain to help you clarify that this feeling is not what it appears to be and to refuse to take the thoughts and urges at face value, to avoid performing compulsive rituals, and to Refocus on constructive behaviors. You can think of the Relabel and Reattribute steps as a team effort, working together with the Refocusing step. The combined effect of these
three steps is much greater than the sum of their individual parts. The process of Relabeling and Reattributing intensifies the learning that takes place during the hard work of Refocusing. As a result, you begin to Revalue those thoughts and urges that, before behavior therapy, would invariably lead you to perform compulsive behaviors. After adequate training in the first three steps, you are able in time to place a much lower value on the OCD thoughts and urges.
We have used the concept of the ""Impartial Spectator,"" developed by 18th-century philosopher Adam Smith, to help you understand more clearly what you are actually achieving while performing the Four Steps of cognitive biobehavioral therapy. Smith described the Impartial Spectator as being like a person inside us who we carry around at all times, a person aware of all our feelings, states, and circumstances. Once we make the effort to strengthen the Impartial Spectator's perspective, we can call up our own Impartial Spectator at any time and literally watch ourselves in action. In otherwords, we can witness our own actions and feelings as someone not involved would, as a disinterested observer. As Smith described it, ""We suppose ourselves the spectators of our own behavior."" He understood that keeping the perspective of the Impartial Spectator clearly in mind, which is essentially the same as using mindful awareness, is hard work, especially under painful circumstances, and requires the ""utmost and most fatiguing exertions."". The hard work of which he wrote seems closely related to the intense efforts you must make in performing the Four Steps.
People with OCD must work hard to manage the biologically induced urges that intrude into conscious awareness. You must strive to maintain awareness of the Impartial Spectator, the observing power within that gives you the capacity to fend off pathological urges until they begin to fade. You must use your knowledge that OCD symptoms are just meaningless signals, false messages from the brain, so you can Refocus and shift gears. You must gather your mental resources, always keeping in mind, ""It's not me--it's my OCD. It's not me--it's just my brain."" Although in the short run, you can't change your feelings, you can change your behavior. By changing your behavior, you find that your feelings also change in time. The tug-of-war comes down to this: Who's in charge here, you or OCD? Even when the OCD overwhelms you, and you give in and perform the compulsion, you must realize that it's just OCD and vow to fight harder the next time.
With compulsive behaviors, simply observing the fifteen-minute rule with consistency and Refocusing on another behavior will usually cause the Revalue step to kick in, which means realizing that the feeling is not worth paying attention to and not taking it at face value, remembering that it's OCD and that it is caused by a medical problem. The result is that you place a much lower value on--devalue--the OCD feeling. For obsessive thoughts, you must try to enhance this process by Revaluing in an even more active way. Two substeps--the two A's--aid you in Step 2: Reattribute: Anticipate and Accept. When you use these two A's, you are doing Active Revaluing. Anticipate means ""be prepared,"" know the feeling is coming, so be ready for it; don't be taken by surprise. Accept means don't waste energy beating yourself up because you have these bad feelings. You know what's causing them and that you have to work around them. Whatever the content of your obsession--whether it is violent or sexual or is manifested in one of dozens of other ways--you know that it can occur hundreds of times a day. You want to stop reacting each time as though it were a new thought, something unexpected. Refuse to let it shock you; refuse to let it get you down on yourself. By anticipating your particular obsessive thought,
you can recognize it the instant it occurs and Relabel it immediately. You will simultaneously, and actively, Revalue it. When the obsession occurs, you will be prepared. You will know, ""That's just my stupid obsession. It has no meaning. That's just my brain. There's no need to pay attention to it."" Remember: You can't make the thought go away, but neither do you need to pay attention to it. You can learn to go on to the next behavior. There is no need to dwell on the thought. Move ahead. This is where the second A--Accept--comes in. Think of the screaming car alarm that disturbs and distracts you. Don't dwell on it. Don't say, ""I can't do another thing until that blankety-blank car alarm shuts off."" Simply try to ignore it and get on with things.
You learned in Step 2 that the bothersome obsessive thought is caused by OCD and is related to a biochemical imbalance in the brain. In the Acceptance substep of Reattributing, you realize that truth in a very deep, perhaps even spiritual, way. Do not get down on yourself. it makes no sense to criticize your inner motives just because of an imbalance in the brain. By accepting that the obsessive thought is there despite you, not because of you, you can decrease the terrible stress that repetitive obsessive thoughts usually cause. Always keep in mind, ""It's not me--it's the OCD. It's not me--it's just my brain."" Don't beat yourself up trying to make the thought go away because in the short run, it will not. Most important, don't ruminate and don't fantasize about the consequences of acting out a terrible obsessive thought. You won't act it out because you don't really want to. Let go of all the negative, demeaning judgments about ""the kinds of people who get thoughts like this."" For obsessions, the fifteen-minute rule can be shortened to a one minute rule, even a fifteen-second rule. There is no need to dwell on that thought, even though it lingers in your mind. You can still go on--indeed, you must go on--to the next thought and the next behavior. In this way, Refocusing is like a martial art. An obsessive thought or compulsive urge is very strong, but also quite stupid. If you stand right in front of it and take the full brunt of its power, trying to drive it from your mind, it will defeat you every time. You have to step aside, work around it, and go on to the next behavior. You are learning to keep your wits about you in the face of a powerful opponent. The lesson here goes far beyond overcoming OCD By taking charge of your actions, you take charge of your mind--and of your life.

Oh, wait…",OCD
100,"Thanks for the A2A. To answer the last part of your question first, it is a common observation that the obsessive thoughts can disappear when the mind is occupied with something productive. I had a client who had recurrent thoughts about contamination, and wash his hands repeatedly to allay them. But, while being engaged in sports, he would have no difficulty diving in mud, without a second thought. So yes, it is definitely considered a useful strategy to incorporate in the treatment plan.
To answer the question about the best treatment options available for OCD, the strategy which is considered to have the highest success rates the world over, based on international multi centre research projects, is a combination of Psychotherapy and Medication Management(Allopathy).
Psychotherapy (commonly, and somewhat incorrectly, referred to as counselling in common parlance) for OCD can be simply explained as a non medicine based process through which the mind can be trained to control the undesirable thoughts and actions. It often can be useful by itself in Mild OCD, but when combined with medicine, even severe OCD can show dramatic response.
Now, to answer the first part of the question, homeopathy appears to be helpful in a subset of cases, generally with mild OCD, especially in the initial stages. As far as I am aware, there aren't any large scale international trials establishing the efficacy of homeopathy in OCD.
Hope this helps.",OCD
101,"Yes it can. However, the most wholistic and comprehensive way is to heal yourself on the physical as well as energetic level. A little homeopathy coupled with a few rounds of healing would really serve you well in treating the ocd from the very core. Then, for long term effects, I would also recommend that you practice meditation atleast thrice a week. This advice is all based on how I, myself benefited in dealing with anxiety and ocd.
www.thesilverlining.co.in can help you connect with the right healers and meditation experts, if you're inclined to start your journey. Also, if you want to connect specifically with a very very caring homeopath come mental health expert, Dr. Monika Maheshwari, please read more about her on http://thesilverlining.co.in/Homeopath/Dr-Monika-Maheshwari/52. I've worked with her personally and I assure that you'll find the comfort you seek when connecting with her for your well-being concerns.
Stay strong.",OCD
102,"Homeopathy works in all cases of everything. We don’t treat the condition/disease. We treat the patient who has the condition - which means their immune system is struggling.
OCD is a serious condition and would need the expert guidance of a professional homeopath as well as patience on your part. But the results can be excellent - far better than any other therapy.",OCD
103,"The actual answer is: it depends, though mostly it wouldn’t.
Homeopathy is going to be ragged on because it’s outside of science, and almost exclusively doesn’t have measurable effects for whatever it’s being used against.
There are times however, that a placebo effect, as you would get from a homeopathic measure, could indeed work on someone with some form of OCD, provided they are not aware they are being treated with a placebo.
Just realize homeopathy is not a valid means treatment for anything beyond having the placebo effect.
All that being said, if you want the person with OCD to have some measure of valid treatment that should/would work in most cases, seek professional help.",OCD
104,I’ve seen it work in many cases including a 70+ year old psychiatrist who had a severe OCD since childhood and it drove him to study the field. Conventional medicine was never helpful for him. He happened to be a textbook case of homeopathic Arsenicum. By 6 weeks mark he reported 70% improvement in his symptoms (happily confirmed by the family). Had he been treated in his childhood he could have had a much happier life.,OCD
105,"Yes, homeopathy can be effective in treating OCD.
To the author of this question and other people posting answers, please remember that the FDA grandfathered homeopathy into the medical system in 1938. If you want, you can use PubMed to look up studies on homeopathy .",OCD
106,"keeping busy or occupied when you have thought based ocd symptoms( non physical version) do work and will be suggested by your doctor too. Thats why they ask patients to take up active hobbies ( not watching tv or something) like reading, gardening, painting ,crafts and do physical exercise with meditation . This definitely works and can be part of your treatment strategy
On the query of homoepathy, I am not very sure since homeopathy works in different manner including some amount of placebo effect , so if you believe in it pls go ahead and try it out. But if you see any increase in your symptoms ( recurring thoughts in your case) pls go back to your allopathy doctor and take medications if needed , homeopathy can be used with allopathy in most cases.
Daily physical exercise ( even 15-20min of walking) and meditation ( 15-30 min ) will definitely help you in any case
take care ( ps: hv u checked your vit D levels, check if u hv not done that)",OCD
107,"Your observation that your OCD almost disappeared when you were mentally active is a very valid observation which can be used to your advantage.
Many of the mental illnesses are associated with repetitive activation of certain brain circuits which result in overthinking and negative mood. Productive mental activities (including meditation) which require attention, concentration, learning, and memorizing can activate alternate healthy brain pathways and reduce the symptoms.",OCD
108,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
109,"The placebo effect is a very powerful aspect of psychopharmacology. About half of depressed patients will show improvement in their symptoms with a placebo. Homeopathic medications will therefore effectively treat about half of all patients with depression. There is no real placebo effect with psychosis. People afflicted with psychotic disorders that are suffering with hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking do not really have the capacity for showing improvement with placebos. So, mild mental disorders might be treated with ineffective medications but severe mental health disorders would not be effectively treated with homeopathic/placebo medications.",OCD
110,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD) is an anxiety disorder where some people have unwanted, recurring thoughts, ideas, or sensations ( obsession) that makes them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsion)
These compulsive acts if not performed, causes a great amount of distress. For instance, an individual will feel the need to have only 3 teaspoons of sugar with their morning coffee, with three different spoons. They need to open-and-shut the door or the light switches a certain number of times before they leave or come back home, or else they feel that something bad might happen to someone they know or the world.
These thoughts, behaviors, and actions are a result of certain cognitive deficits.
When you see a kitchen counter dirty, your brain gives a signal to clean it up. People with OCD get these signals repeatedly.
Some cognitive deficits associated with basic learning processes, executive functioning, attention, and decision making are a result due to communication error in some parts of the brain like orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, etc., And abnormalities in the neurotransmitter levels. These lead to cognitive deficits.
Everyone experiences intrusive thoughts but people with OCD misinterpret these thoughts and take them to have personal significance, with catastrophic consequences.
Some common deficits in the cognition are:
Inflated sense of responsibility where the person believes that if they follow the compulsions, they can save others from some catastrophic consequences.
Control of thoughts where they believe that it's necessary and possible to control their thoughts.
Overestimation of danger where they believe that danger is possible and will lead to bad.
Perfectionism where they believe that one simply can't make mistakes.
Over importance of a thought where they believe that thinking about a negative event might increase the possibility of it's occurrence.
These cognitive dysfunctions lead to huge amounts of distress in day-to-day functioning and a normal day routine too becomes an ordeal.
Thus a person is not able to function properly and cognitive functions are hard to perform.",OCD
111,"Hi Alessio! OCD is most pervasive mental disorder. It is very disturbing to the sufferer’s daily performance, their perceptions, their thinking, their decision-making, their time-management, their family and other emotional life. In this disorder, we find these two components “obsessive” and “compulsive” at an equal distribution. We all may be a tiny bit obsessive about certain things, but we are unlikely to also be compulsive.
OCD is listed in both diagnostic manuals, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (the DSM IV plus a an addition, mostly used in the United States) and the International Classification of Diseases (Version 10, used in Europe) as “Disorders”, which means it lacks signs and symptoms seen for instance in Schizophrenia, but its presentation and manifestion is far more pronounced than, e.g. in neurotic or stress-related disorder.
The disorder has as its main characteristic most intrusive recurrent involuntary thoughts and ideas which the sufferer often feels shocked and frightened about as they may present as a suggestion of doing something dangerous. One former patient felt drawn to kitchen knives as a means of injuring a particular family member.
The second manifestation of OCD is the compulsion to wash, count, check. The urges are so powerful und compulsive that ANY activities of daily living, even the simplest ones such as getting dressed, cannot be petformed. Time - management is lost. Getting dressed may be impossible or take hours as most activities are most frequently disrupted by some OCD routines.
A patient with OCD may not find sleep at night due to a recurrent need to get up to check water taps, light and mains switches, doors and locks.
You will take from this description that the patient with this condition tends to be UNABLE to maintain functions of daily living. This includes petformances of personal care, work-related and household tasks, preparation of meals, maintanance of a normal sleep-wake cycle, etc. The disorder is so deeply ingrained that there is literally no mental space left for any acts of recreation or simply paying attention to persons and events going on beyond the own person.
The patients suffer incredibly. They are aware that they themselves are highly disfunctional (although not dis-integrated as in the Schizophrenias) and they watch their family live falling apart. It is widely recognised that simply suggesting to them not to pay attention to their compulsive thoughts as this almost always causes them to feel intolerable levels of anxiety.
You may be aware that the condition is difficult to treat. Therapies need to comprise different approaches.",OCD
112,"OCD makes it harder for you to focus on anything
I’d be watching a movie,or reading a book,and then there comes intrusive thoughts,so I need to focus twice as much to actually understood what’s happening. But even if it happens,nothing is as enjoyable anymore as it used to.
And It can actually reduce or shrink the size of hippocampus which is responsible for processing memories and emotions.",OCD
113,"When people with OCD aren’t obsessing, their brains work fine, just the same as anyone else’s.
BUT when they are obsessing, they are highly anxious. And anxiety interferes with attention and concentration, it interferes with EVERYTHING; so of course you can’t think properly, as nobody who is very distracted by anxiety can.",OCD
114,"When you are fallen in a loophole of OCD cycle for a long time, your brain is in continuous effect of anxiety.
During the refocusing step of CBT where you have to shift your focus to anything apart from performing the compulsion ritual, it not only takes the utmost pain but actually puts your neural connections work in a reverse manner to break that chain of OCD cycle. And it depends how strong your connections have developed over time so its actually very difficult to rewire your system.
Till then your attention span and range including information processing and overall cognitive function with memory etc is deteriorated.",OCD
115,"I don’t know if I’d call it a “defect”, exactly, but brain scans of people with OCD are different than those of people without it - the prefrontal cortex of the brain is overactive in people with OCD. It also appears to be related to an imbalance in the levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, with serotonin levels being abnormally low and dopamine levels, abnormally high. Certainly, though, the OCD brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, uses far more energy than the non-OCD brain.",OCD
116,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

117,"Your brain processes things faster than a supercomputer does already. Improving on that would not only take ages, it would also lead to very minute results.
However, when we look at your results (in this case, working, learning and reacting faster) then we should look at the opposite side of the coin.
If our brain is such a supercomputer, then why does it sometimes feel like it is lagging behind?
It’s because we have too much junk floating around our minds.
It’s not about increasing your speed but about removing the blocks inside your head that will make your mind move faster.
So… how do we go about doing that?
Well, there are a few things you can do:
Become more aware of what you are doing - Be in the moment and pay attention to what you are doing right now! Relieve your mind of all the other crap you are thinking of at the time and just focus on what is currently happening.
There is a time and place to think about the other things later.
RELAX & ACTIVATE - Try this right now: stare at a wall in the room and relax your eyebrows, your forehead and the top of your cheekbones. Then open your eyes as wide as you can without straining them. Take 5 DEEP breaths while you are doing this. Do this while standing and/or stretching and you will feel you are able to focus far easier. Practice this often.
Stay fit and active - Drinking loads of water, breathing deeply and exercising regularly are all things that will increase your blood flow and energy, allowing your body to deliver more oxygen to your brain, which it thrives upon.
Eating lean helps your body stay light, which also means your mind stays light. The more your body has to deal with the more your mind has to deal with, even if it is not conscious for you it will still make things harder on you.
Write down what clutters your mind - Worried about grocery shopping? Anxious about that next test? Not sure how to impress your boss at work? Write it down! This removes it from your mind, puts a plan into action to deal with it and allows your mind to focus on more important things.
First, write down what is distracting you. Stick to ONLY the facts.
Second, write down when you can think about it. Give yourself an exact time and day. Schedule a meeting with yourself.
Third, create a plan during that meeting of what you will do about it. Do not focus on what you could do but make a plan of what you will do that will solve the problem.
Get OBSESSED - Spend every waking minute on it, learn as much as you can and force yourself to stick with it as long as possible. Research only that what interests you and grow your like into a passion and your passion into an obsession. Once you are obsessed about it you will work on the level of a high-performer!",OCD
118,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD
119,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
120,They are the opposite of who you really are. What is happening is the fear center of your brain the amygdala is malfunctioning or misfiring sending you an anxiety spike by mistakenly warning you that you are in danger of the thought. When anxiety happens your brain then tries to solve the question of this thought. You tell yourself wait a minute that’s not me that’s bullshit. Your brain will then again test you with the thought. Because the amygdala is primal and cannot be reasoned with it fires another anxiety spike perhaps bigger than the first one warning you that you are in danger of the thought. It gets stronger because you flagged it as important by reacting to it. Trying to solve the thought starts to create a loop where you get the thought as a test. You then repel from the thought. Your amygdala responds because you have shown it that it is correct for sending you the anxiety by your actions of avoiding and questioning the thought as well as your severe non acceptance of this thought. Since the amygdala is a non reasoning part of the brain and only learns from your actions it’s response gets just gets stronger. It’s really just acting as your best friend warning you of the danger you are in because of the thought that you keep showing it through your actions of avoidance and disdain is so very important to you. Basically it’s your actions of avoidance that are the food the amygdala needs to show it that it is correct to keep warning you. The constant anxiety makes you doubt yourself and think that it’s real and you are what these thoughts are telling you. Your not. This comfort and truth won’t really help you however. In a twist of cruelty reassurances that you get from yourself or others only feed the disorder by reinforcing to the Amygdala that it is indeed right to warn you every time you have the thoughts. Through the proper therapy you will learn to teach the amygdala that you are not afraid of these thoughts and in fact welcome them from your actions of accepting them and running toward them using exposures to teach your amygdala that you are perfectly okay with having them. After a while the amygdala learns that you are not afraid of the thoughts and it stops sending you all this discomfort. The thoughts then lose their power and since they are not important to you anymore they stop bothering you with them.,OCD
121,"Everything you are is real, therefore your thoughts too, are real. I am diagnosed with OCD, and my thoughts are very much real. As real as “What should I have for dinner?” or “I need to go to the bathroom”. But the OCD thoughts aren’t who you are. Let’s for the sake of expleining this easy that you have a little annoying devil sitting in your mind with a megaphone and yelling your worst fears to you. It’s your head and your mind, but it’s not your thoughts. I would think “This is nasty, better go clean it off.” My devil will say “You need to clean it three times, with hot water and soap, or else it’s not clean and I will make you feel dirty forever.” The OCD twists the thing you are afraid of into something so much more bigger that it really has to be.
The problem is though I know they are real, I also know they are not rational. They are demanding and intrusive. Like for instance: I felt like I touched the side of my pants, so I need to go wash my hands now. The thought is real, the feeling is real, the fear is real and the anxiety is real. But the thought is not rational.
Let’s look at it from a logical standpoint. Every OCD thought spires from something once logical or partially logical. Let’s take the above example for instance. If you greased your pants and touched it and got grease on your hands you surely would wipe it off or rinse your hands, maybe even use soap to get all the oil and grease off, and then you would go about your normal day as nothing ever happened, right? So what I feel in this situation is indeed logical that if you indeed touched something actually dirty or sticky, you should clean your hands. Me, who has OCD (and in treatment for it) would stop and think while knowing my pants are fresh out of the closet this morning and not spilled on. “Did I somehow spill microbes of grease on my pants? What if I touched there while going to the bathroom? What if I bumped into something? What if, what if, what if?” And then I think, surely nothing would happen. I am not afraid of contagious deseases or anything, but I am so terrified of feeling dirty forever that I just want to remove the threat by changing clothes and cleaning my hands so that I don’t touch other things including myself, and no longer have any control over where the “grease” went. Because I know deep down that it would result in washing EVERYTHING in my apartment.
This concludes that the thoughts are real, but all the layers you need to dig through to get to the real thought is just illusions. You have to’s and what if’s. It’s simply not true.
What I’ve learned in treatment is that basically every time my hands or some part of me feel dirty ,touch it and then touch everything else near you, including your hair, face and what not’s and just sit there and feel your skin crawl until it passes. Then do something else and don’t shower until next morning. The clothes shall be reused the next day. This has helped me tremendously. I still have OCD thoughts, and are not done with therapy, but the situations and anxiety reduces from each time a thought appears, to each day it appears.
So to conclude. YES, the thoughts are VERY REAL. It’s the actions and why the thoughts are the way they get profiled in our minds that’s not rational. And we are painfully aware of this.",OCD
122,"Absolutely. It is one of the most interesting and perplexing condition I work with. It is not the same as someone being a neat freak or wanting things their way. It is symptoms of obsessive and repetitive thoughts and actions related to severe anxiety. Grandiose ideas, fixed beliefs, severe depression and low self esteem all at the same time. Thoughts in your head telling to do things over and over that are illogical. Rituals of counting. Inability to leave the house. Obsession with news religion sex and politics are the most popular. Thoughts paralyzing to get day to day activities complete. It is debilitating.",OCD

Sorry if this is too sarcastic..
Well, actually, the DSM is always on permanent revising, so we should take that by rules written in stone. But… The newer ones are more open to argument.
OCD is a very real, documented, issue.
It isn’t about tidy things, like pens must all have be parallels. It’s about the anxiety that comes if some ritual isn’t performed, if something isn’t ‘as it should’.
In the end it may be a kind of magical thinking. But knowing this doesn’t help much with the pain.",OCD
124,"It's very real. OCD is not just wanting something to be straight. It's taking ten+ minutes to put tables together because they aren't even. It's washing your hands with burning hot water until they bleed. It's locking a door twenty times to make sure your family is safe. It's using so much hand sanitizer that your hands are dry and reek of alcohol. It's having non stop intrusive thoughts about wanting to kill those you love. It's taking forever getting ready because you have to do everything three times, the five times, then one last time. OCD is not wanting things to be perfect. It's your brain controlling your life and breaking you.",OCD
125,"Usually not.
People with OCD have to use objective measures to assess how accurate their thoughts are, because the nature of the disorder is such that thoughts with no basis in reality can become stuck in the mind of the patient.
Some examples of reality checks:
If you have obsessive thoughts that you are gay, ask yourself: Have I ever had intercourse with a person of my sex? Have I ever masturbated to someone of my same sex?
If you have obsessive thoughts that you are a danger to children, ask yourself: Have I ever harmed a child?
If you have obsessive thoughts that you ran over someone with your car, ask yourself: Do I have evidence that such a thing occurred? If I’m identidying every speed bump as a possible person I ran over, can I think of all the other times where I have gone over speed bumps and not run someone over? (Perhaps I am seeing meaning in randomness…) etc.",OCD
126,"None's thoughts are real. Our brains filter a lot of reality out. Our memories can feel very real but they are just a very filtered version of what really happened, and with time we even lose a lot of the details although they feel as real as if it had happened yesterday.
The brain is designed to do whatever it needs for you to survive long enough for reproduction ( and not to make you happy) so what memories you keep and how those memories are filtered depend greatly on the emotions you felt at the time, how tired you were (brain activity requires a lot of energy), how much focus you had on what happened, your serotonin levels (low serotonin levels make you lose perception of positive aspects of reality) and mostly on what you need to be kept safe.
This is affecting everyone, not just people with OCD. Your thoughts are highly dependent on the memories you have of your experiences, and the brain brings thoughts to you as what you are experiencing at the moment triggers them, even though you might not be remembering your past experiences themselves, they are based on them, as it is needed to keep you safe.",OCD

128,"OCD thoughts are very real -- but they are about irrational or imaginary issues.
For instance, I am a compulsive over-thinker. The 'thoughts' I'm having are very, very real, but the act of thinking about them over and over and over, is the OCD.
On top of that, PTSD and anxiety adds thoughts which can be thought about even more. If you start to think of ""What if's ..."" (as they are called), it's the ""What ifs...."" that start to clog you down.
There is non-narcotic and non-habit-forming medication available for OCD thoughts ... if you can calm the anxiety (OCD is anxiety-related), you can often quell the ideas.",OCD
129,"I certainly hope so; otherwise I've been suffering for nothing all of these years.
OCD is very real. You can even elicit the same behaviors with amphetamines, which likely points to neurochemistry as one of the components (or at least contributors) of the disorder. It's also common in my family, as is depression, which reinforces the notion that genetics may also play a part.
In actuality, though, it is a very complex disease caused by various factors ranging from biology to psychology. It is very much real, though I'm sure anyone afflicted by it wished it weren't.",OCD

Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.

131,"In my experience, severe OCD responds only to medication. Perhaps the other people opining on this question have not seen cases as severe as I have. When OCD is really severe it is the most crippling psychiatric disorder. I think it is often worse than schizophrenia. Sufferers cannot function and their lives are ruined. When they occasionally gain some temporary relief from ERT they usually experience symptom substitution. However, with good medication management they can go into remission and live normal lives.
Again, we are not talking about the milder cases that go directly to psychologists and respond to exposure therapy, we are talking about the severe cases that end up ruining the lives of the sufferers.",OCD
132,"Hi sweetheart. Of course you can. I am at the end of my Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT), and it has worked wonders. I have almost no OCD left.
The one thing that people misunderstand with this treatment is that they tell you that you will never recover completly. Well, they’re wrong. Let’s say that your OCD is 100%, mine is now 20%, and the average normal person is 5%.
Everybody has 5% in terms that everybody get intrusive thoughts now and then, and everyone has the feelinh that “Ugh, it’s not good enough. Better do it one more time.” The difference is that they don’t bother with the self loathing. They just do it, or just ignore those intrusive thoughts like anything else or think it’s rather funny that they were capable of thinking of drowning their friend in anger. That is where we come in. We never let it go, or vi so our compulsions until our hands are raw and bleeding. We feel like we are forced to, instead of feeling that it would be good to to it.
So, no one is 0% OCD. And you need to remember that. This will help you. Because you will get urges and thoughts like everyone else, but with the list under you will also learn how to ignore those thoughts and go about your day as everyone else. 5% is good. Embrace your 5%, okay?
Now. How to get to 5%?
First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems. The best treatment is Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT). Because if you do try to overcome this alone, you will relapse multiple times resulting in a worse relapse every time. I can speak on behalf of my self and thousands of other people with OCD or compulsive behavior.
Second you should make a private list of your goals and then work it out together with your appointed doctor. The list should include:
* Why do I want this?
* Who am I doing it for? (The answer should ALWAYS be yourself, but you have to mean it a 100%)
* A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
* Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
* Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
* Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
* As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
* Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
* If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
* Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your...

133,"Yes I think it would be worth a try. When I went through my OCD episode I was prescribed setraline. It’s an antidepressant but is mainly prescribed for anxiety disorders. It has mild side effects like a rash, dizziness and fatigue. The initial rise in depression/anxiety can be hard but after a few weeks it will go down. Doctors may start you on a 25/50mg dose depending on your age. If this has little affect they will slowly up the dose.
For me the sertraline lessened the intrusive thoughts to a manageable level where I could work on the compulsions. After 5 months of CBT and medication I could see a slight difference. It takes a lot of work but now compulsions and intrusive thoughts don’t plague my day.
Of course there is always the chance of a relapse. Sometimes a random scary thought sticks for a little or I feel an urge to do a compulsion. However I feel I have the tools now to cope. You can too and I think taking medication can help you to begin your journey to recovery.
Good luck! X",OCD
134,Not usually. The exception to this might be if there are clear symptoms of a clinical depression in which case antidepressant might be prescribed prior to starting Exposure Therapy. This is because there is some evidence that the presence of a clinical depression can inhibit and even prevent the habituation that normal occurs with repeated exposure to the situations that provoke the OCD behaviour. So failure to treat the clinical depression might slow or undermine the psychological treatment response.,OCD
135,"It can be cured
First of all let me clear this there is no cure for many other diseases like if you had a heart attack there will always be a chance that you'll get it if you don't take proper medicine fpr a life time . So it goeswith OCD actually its a lie because phichiatrist want patient they can not live with out them so they make excuses like taking medicine will help you .
Actually you don't even need a medicine if you want you can take it'll help you there is no shame about 10 in every 50 americans take anti depressants soo everyone has something that disturbs them for ocd patients its just a myth that they have categorized it in ocd it can be cure i mean it is literally very easy but hard to accept as you would have heard from people that when i want to forget something it comes back … So do everyone have OCD ? Noo may you also don't have it. Step to over come it easily it takes time may be 10 days not more .
Whe you get the thought accept it yeah its ohk am doing it just go through every where your mind takes you .
When the thought pops up by anything just say ohk yeah right . (Deep inside you know you have full control over your mind) soo just go with the flow and i garanty you that thought will vanish . And if after some time it hits you repeat the process.
Don't be to scared by what if ? What if? Because you won't do anything you are a normal human being and no matter how bad is your thought everyone would really have thought about it once in there life so its not outta this world .
Face your fear ohk ? Don't ever fight with I knoe it won't be easy because you will think may be I'll be the way you r thinking right now but blve me you will be normal .
The main point about OCD your mind wants you not to fear so just don't fear accept it . There's nothing what you think is going to happen .
Now you are free from it so just be calm ,write and memorize every point that is against your thought that why you shouldn't think about it . Why it is not right to do or to think about it .
It can be cured treatment and cure are the same things every health issue can come back So don't worry treatment is itself a cure . It just disturbing the number of times it comes back is more . And am sure when you'll get the key that accept it that'll be a joke to you after words like how foolish i was . Hope not out :)",OCD
136,"Unfortunately there is no “medicine” for OCD. There is no known cause of OCD, there is no cure, and there is no way to objectively define or diagnose OCD, therefore there is no specific medicine available to treat it or counteract it. There are drugs that may or may not reduce some symptoms for some people but the exact mechanism behind how they function is not known.
Because of these facts I would suggest that people don’t take drugs to treat OCD as they are only temporarily masking the symptoms of OCD not doing anything to treat the condition.",OCD
137,"It depends on the severity. My son started taking medication when he was 6 to manage his anxiety. His symptoms became more manageable over time and he stopped medication after 4 years. He has been in remission, no apparent symptoms for 10 years.
So, if you feel that you are not able to manage, consult your doctor and he/she will be able to advise.
All the best",OCD
138,"Although SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are traditionally classified as ""antidepressants,"" they also help with panic, and with what I might call ""obsessive worry."" For example, a woman gets off the phone, wonders if a particular remark might have upset her friend, frets about whether she should call the friend back and make it right. When she is taking her SSRI, she's more likely to think, ""well, if it really bothered her, I guess I'll hear about it later.""
One description of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) is that the person has trouble stopping his compulsions because he is anxious and worries about them until he gives in and carries them out. The medication helps lessen the anxiety, and makes it more tolerable when he resists the compulsion.
Generally the effective dose of SSRI is higher for OCD than for depression or panic disorder. And even then, it's not magic. The patient still has to make the effort to resist his compulsions. The SSRI only improves his chances of winning the battle. Therapy improves his chances further (usually specific therapy for OCD, like response prevention).
The questioner asks about negative thoughts. Usually I would advise someone with obsessive negative thoughts not to try to eliminate them, but to identify them as such and learn to tolerate them. (""There I go again, worrying about the end of the world. Back to vacuuming..."") Again, the SSRI tends to make this easier.",OCD
139,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD
140,"I found that management was demanding. People with OCD crave certainty, and when we deal with people, there is no certainty.
Technical and work dealing with exactness tend to be a good fit for some people that I’ve known with OCD. My position required many hours of study and writing each week. That part of my job fit well for me.
Exactness in an environment that does not require quick interaction with a variety of people is considered by some to be an excellent vocational possibility.
Photography is one of my hobbies. I’ve been told that professional photography can be a good vocational choice.
I've read that vocations requiring goal setting and meeting deadlines are not a healthy pursuit for a person with OCD. Positions requiring intense personal interactions tend not to be a good choice.
I’m told that often public speaking is not a good choice for the person OCD. However, it was a major part of the position that I held for 43 years, and many people have told me that I did it well.",OCD
141,"One of the easiest ways to start a business is online. Not only can you do so with little to no budget, but it doesn't require any prior experience.
While there are various methods to start your career online, I suggest having a website for the best impact. For a website, you will need a domain name, web host, and a platform to build it. Don’t worry if it sounds difficult, you will see that it's actually quite easy!
If you already have a website, feel free to skip this part. If you don't have a website, then I highly recommend reading this through.
Domain name. Since it will be your website's address, it's essential to make it memorizable. It can also help a lot with branding if the domain is your business name. Make sure it's short and catchy. To check whether the domain name you came up with is taken or not, feel free to use a domain checker.
Web Host is needed to have your website online. Choosing the most suitable provider might be difficult; therefore, here are some of the features I recommend to look for:
Uptime. A web host provider who offers a 99.9% uptime guarantee assures more stability to your website.
Performance. When choosing a hosting provider, I suggest looking up what they are offering to improve your website's performance. A good example would be a provider that is optimized for WordPress, offers a plugin like LiteSpeed Cache plugin, and uses solid-state drivers (SSD) rather than hard-disk drives (HDD).
Customer support. 24/7 customer support is important so you could get help at any time. Not only will you feel more comfortable, but also save lots of time, by getting help in understanding where the issue is.
Price. Online business is very accessible because it doesn’t require a big budget. Shared hosting is the most popular choice for starting, it is often used for small to medium-size websites as it has all the needed features for it and can cost as little as $1.99/month.
Platform. There are a variety of platforms you could use to build a website online. Surely you can code it yourself as well. Although, if that isn't your preference, I recommend trying a content management system WordPress.
It's widely known and used CMS, and has a lot of customization options. While it takes some time to get used to it, you can create astonishing things with WordPress.
And that’s it. Don’t hesitate and register your website now. Then, you can finally start your own online business.
Ways to start a business online:
Affiliate marketing. These days, it's a popular method for people who wish to start their career online. To simplify the idea, being an affiliate means promoting a product or service of a company of your choice.
Since it's something you will have to be dedicated to, choose a company whose products you enjoy. Some people write reviews on their website, include affiliate links, and even make videos. It's up to you to come up with ideas on how to do it.
Blogging. Starting a blog can be quite a profitable business, since not only could you place ads, but also gain sponsors, and implement affiliate marketing too. Placing ads is easy. Google AdSense is a popular choice due to its effectiveness and simplicity.
While it takes time to write content for your blog, it will eventually bring traffic and sponsor offers that will help with exposure. In the end, blogging can also help with affiliate marketing business, as you can write reviews about the products you are an affiliate of.
Starting a store. This choice is quite flexible, as you don't necessarily have to sell your own products. If you choose dropshipping, all you have to worry about is finding a wholesaler and creating a marketing strategy.
If you decide to choose WordPress, WooCommerce plugin will be a great help in building your online store. Make sure you choose a niche you are passionate about; this will help you develop ideas that would make you unique from your competitors.
Those are some of the most popular ways to start a business online. I wish you the best with your business!",OCD
142,"I’ve treated several hundred people with OCD, and they have had many and varied occupations and none.
The best occupation is one that the person likes, and that they find meaningful. Yes, OCD can interfere with the performance of those duties - a pharmacist who had difficulty dispensing due to checking and re-checking springs to mind, also a shop assistant who did the same and kept a running total of what was in the till in his mind - but the best occupation is one that suits you.
Having a meaningful life is the best motivation to work on getting rid of the OCD.

143,"Hi Cagatay! A person with this condition will feel far better adapted to a working place, where they are on their own. She or he will be looking for a place where they can set up and maintain their own order, which will be respected by colleagues. They are best left to their own devices, being so-called lone workers. They often feel most comfortable working with computers, clocks, (small) machines. This is because these are so very highly predictable, and this is what they need most in order to feel comfy.
They are unlikely to get great satisfaction from working with people because it often means too much commotion, restlesness, unpredictability, randomness - no day may be the same as yesterday or two weeks ago. It needs to be predictable!
They will probably severely dislike being touched, even if it was for a shake-hands.",OCD
144,"People with OCD often thrive in jobs that allow them to use their natural strengths—attention to detail, organization, and precision—while also offering some structure and clear expectations. Roles that require meticulous work or offer a high level of focus and routine can be a great fit. For example, jobs in fields like accounting, bookkeeping, or auditing can be ideal, as these roles require a strong attention to detail, an ability to work methodically, and a knack for spotting inconsistencies or errors. Similarly, careers in data entry or quality control, where accuracy and consistency are key, can provide a structured environment that works well for individuals with OCD. Many people with OCD also excel in research positions, whether in science, technology, or academia, as these roles often involve deep focus and a methodical approach to solving problems. Creative fields, such as graphic design or editing, can also be a good fit, particularly if the person enjoys working with specific guidelines, formatting, or structure while still being able to express creativity within those boundaries. Other jobs, such as library science, archiving, or museum curation, offer a quiet, organized environment where attention to detail and systematization are important, but the work can also be relatively predictable and consistent. Healthcare jobs like laboratory technicians or medical records management may also appeal to individuals with OCD because they require precision and adherence to protocol. While people with OCD often have a strong work ethic and a desire to do things ""right,"" it's important to find a role that doesn’t become overwhelming due to perfectionism or excessive checking, which can lead to burnout. Jobs that offer flexibility in terms of pacing or the ability to take breaks when needed—along with supportive workplaces that are understanding of mental health needs—can help create an environment where someone with OCD can thrive. Ultimately, finding the right job for someone with OCD involves choosing a role that taps into their strengths without triggering excessive stress or obsessive behaviors. The best jobs allow individuals to apply their natural talents for organization, detail, and structure, while also maintaining a balanced, manageable workload.",OCD
145,"A therapist, psychologist, or social worker that specializes in OCD is the first thing that comes to my mind.
Otherwise, jobs that put your mind to work which then distracts your mind from your tendencies has worked for some people. Using this, this means jobs that don’t require mental work and can make you suspect to your mind wandering and getting into the tendencies would not be recommended.
That all being said, obsessions often target things one finds values in, meaning any job can become a hinderance. Thus, it really depends on how the individual’s obsessive compulsive tendencies manifest and how they can manage it.",OCD

148,"Answering this as someone who's been a nurse dealing with OCD for the past 7 years.
I can share my experience on how this condition has shaped my career. Initially, OCD made me hyper-aware of cleanliness and detail. As I started to build my career in nursing I learned to channel my triggers into maintaining great hygiene standards and ensuring every patient's needs are met.
Through therapy and self-awareness, I turned what could be seen as a challenge into a strength. Like, my attention to detail helps me catch small changes in patients' conditions early, leading to better outcomes.
It's about understanding my triggers and using them to improve patient care.
In my group therapy sessions (through ‘MantraCare’, 100% recommend), I've met professionals from various fields who, like me, understood how to take advantage of their OCD. One of them, an editor, is great in his role due to his perfectionism.
Beyond nursing and editing, OCD can also benefit careers like accounting, where precision is needed, or software development, where thoroughness is valued in coding and testing. Even roles in research and quality control are great.
Ultimately, finding the right job involves understanding how your OCD manifests and aligning it with roles that value those qualities.

150,"No. They are entirely different diseases. Autism affects children and is characterised by:
Impaired social interaction and communication loke loss of eye to eye contact
Language developmental delay
Restrictive, repetitive stereotyped behaviors like hand wringing
OCD can arise in any age group but most cases have onset during adolescence. It is characterised by recurrent, unwanted, intrusive thoughts called obsessions which will give rise to anxiety followed by a compulsive urge to perform certain actions/rituals/behaviours repeatedly inorder to alleviate the anxiety.",OCD
151,"You may be confused because OCD and Autism are both characterized by repetitive behaviours. However, the difference is in their source. The underlying cause of OCD is usually anxiety. In fact in earlier editions of DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th ed) OCD was included under Anxiety disorders. The underlying cause of Autism is a neurodevelopmental abnormality with predominant language and communication impairments. OCD is not associated with any language impairment. There are biological differences too. Moreover, the onset, that is the time when the symptoms first manifest are different for both. OCD is more likely to be diagnosed in adults. Autism can be detected by 2–3 yrs i.e, it has a childhood onset. Prenatal detection is also possible, but perhaps with diminished accuracy. OCD is triggered off by a stressful event. OCD also responds to CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy). Although available genetic data show a significant inheritable trend for both, OCD is more contaminated by cultural and environmental factors than Autism. I could go on but I think the difference is clear.",OCD
152,"I think there's a connection between autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
I collect lots of things related to my interests. I collect terabytes of digital information. I also love collection of computer devices - desktops, laptops, smartphones, USB sticks, memory cards (mostly SD and MicroSD), tablets, mouses, keyboards, photo and video cameras. I prefer not to throw out old devices because it would reduce my collection. I wish my idea with Virtual Reality timelapses of weather comes true so that I'd lose the fear that I run out of money needed to pay for my idea (it's not necessary to pay for the idea if it's made not at my cost) - then I'd extend my collection of computer devices even more - for example several 2.5"" external HDDs even if I don't need more storage - just because I find the devices beautiful.
If such big collection is related to special interests (one of signs of autism) and big collections are considered ""obsessive-compulsive disorder"" then the connection between autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder is proven. Both states aren't diseases - autism has its own advantages - same with obsessive-compulsive disorder. I even asked before whether obsessive-compulsive disorder has advantages - the answer was positive.
Are there any advantages of being obsessive-compulsive?",OCD
153,"Q: “What is the relationship between autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder? What might explain why OCD is the most common comorbidity in ASD?”
ASD (although I dispute the ‘spectrum idea) represents issues in the developed capacity to ‘symbolize’ - not artistic symbolization (although related), but the primary symbolic functioning - crudely the cognitive and emotional ability to allow one thing or idea to stand in place of another thing or idea (which thing may be absent or abstract).
So, instead of Salvador Dali and melting clocks, think ‘mother leaves the room that baby is in and is ‘gone’; baby either has a symbolic representation of her mother in her mind, or she does not’.
From this baby example you can imagine that developing the capacity to symbolize - allowing some other object or idea to stand in for an absent mother - is an emotional as well as a cognitive achievement. Although the baby is substituting a mental object so as not to be totally bereft, she is also ‘allowing’ that the mother is absent - an existential reality for her. Along the way to achieving this capacity we find the famous ‘security blanket’, or ‘transitional object’, or ‘concrete equation’, which is half symbol, half hallucination (perhaps).
The development of symbolic capacity then allows the possibility of separation from the mother to be tolerated. The mother is ‘gone’, but ‘kept in mind’, and so long as she returns in time, our symbolization of her existence has protected us from the fear of her permanent absence, which is equivalent to a later fear on a par with the fear of death or annihilation.
This symbolic development is probably essential in learning to communicate through speech. Language is composed of symbolic tokens - words which stand in for ‘things’ (you cannot get ‘things’ into your head to ‘think’ with) - and in a similar way to the mother example, we must trust that we can ‘let go’ of the things themselves so that the words can symbolically represent them. This is why severe autism often affects language capacity.
But further, think on this. The word ‘table’ is a symbol. We use it to describe all the millions of tables in the world. We do not need to have seen all the tables in the world. When we come across a new table we have not seen before it is not a problem. But if you cannot use symbols consistently, it is not so straight forward. What you eat breakfast off in the kitchen is in almost infinite detail different from that other object with four legs in the dining room. Without being able to use the category ‘table’, how do you know that far from being what you may eat off, the one in the dining room will not rear up on two of those legs and eat you?
To the extent that our autism compromises our symbolic capacity, we may need to learn ‘by rote’ every ‘object’ (things and people) quite separately in order to feel existentially safe. This is an impossible task and this is why many autistic children fly into rages of terror when routines, details and environments are changed. It is symbolization that grants us the capacity to tolerate the infinitely varied reality of our world.
OCD symptoms in non-autistic people arise from a different source (unconscious fears and fantasies about the destructiveness of our thoughts), but all existential fears, whatever their source, threaten to overwhelm our capacities to contain them, and lead to concrete ritualistic behaviors, in the same way that the much more benign ‘security blanket’ solution is produced in infancy for the absent mother.
In sum ASD is an effect in the area of symbolization. The capacity to symbolize contains much of the primitive anxiety we all have to experience in life and development. OCD is a more or less ‘concrete’ attempt to relieve those anxieties - in most people representing a partial and often temporary breakdown in symbolic capacity, but in severely autistic people a relative deficit or fault in such capacity.",OCD
154,"I am formally diagnosed with both ASD and OCD so I will attempt to answer this question: What is the relationship between autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder? What might explain why OCD is the most common comorbidity in ASD?
While I've always felt like these two conditions are separate and affect me in different ways, I can actually see connections upon further reflection. For example: I can be quite rigid in my thinking; I can get fixated on the idea that certain things should be done in certain ways (I try really hard to avoid this as “should” thinking can be quite toxic); I'm also really resistant to change. All of these traits that I feel stem from my autism directly affect my ocd which mainly revolves around doing things in a particular way.
I haven't heard that OCD is the most common comorbidity or even that there is much inter-connection (not disagreeing, just saying in my experience of not actively seeking out this information, I haven't come across it). My psychologist said that some studies suggest up to 80% of people with ASD also have ADHD but often go undiagnosed as the symptoms overlap so much and often people aren't looking for additional causes. This is her area of study, I know she doesn't know as much about OCD. Of course it doesn't work the other way around as many, many more people have ADHD than ASD. I can't really comment on this part of the question but I'm also formally diagnosed with ADHD and do feel a lot more overlap with that than with my OCD. My nearly 82yo dad is not formally diagnosed with any of them but almost certainly has all three as well so it feels to my limited personal experience that there is definitely a bit of interconnectedness going on.",OCD
155,"ASD is always comorbid and thats the nature of ASD, but no one person is the same.
Both myself and my son have been guinea pigs in ASD research and in one study it, was
discovered our hearing sensitivity in sound discrimination was so sensitive , it takes Universities
upto ten years to find ASD people with our level of sensitivity around hearing and so on.
However we never complained or were bothered by sound or noise when we attended school.
My learning barriers were mainly physical and focus based. Other ASD people who are alot less sensitive react strongly to sound and are far less sensitive. OCD you are correct in saying is a very common comorbidity with ASD , but it’s the same thing , every person is different in relation to how that manifests itself in a person.",OCD
156,"No.
But it can be, and often is, co-morbid (occurring at the same time) with disorders on the autism spectrum.
The good news (if you can call it that) is that although there is no treatment for Autism, OCD can be treated with medicines and therapy. And if you can treat the conditions that are co-morbid with Autism, you can free up time and energy to find ways to cope with the Autism a little better.

If you look at the older OCD literature, you can see hints that they knew something was up… case histories talking about lack of friends, or listing schizoid personality as a co-morbidity. The assumption then was that doing the rituals or hiding them was causing people to be isolated socially.
When I went to Kaiser, they recommended The OCD Workbook. That book lists “Being easily bothered by the feel of clothing or other textures on the skin”. This isn’t mentioned on most OCD symptom lists, but sensory issues have been added to the symptoms of autism in the DSM 5",OCD

Autism is different from OCD. Autism affects the children from the early childhood. Autistic children do have symptoms very similar to OCD. There can be an overlap of Autism and OCD sometimes.
Very good information between the difference between the two can be found in the following link.

160,"OCD can be harmful at any level. It becomes harmful when it directly affects daily living activities and quality of life. At the lower end of the spectrum
it can consume one's thoughts and mental activity. At the greater end
of the spectrum it can consume multiple hours of the day performing
compulsions to the point where one is trapped in their own home unable
to work, maintain relationships and stay healthy.
The anxiety associated with OCD can place mental and physical stress that can be quite taxing and destructive. Without proper guidance and education OCD can harm marriages and families. Many spouses and family members lack an understanding of OCD which can negatively affect relationships. Many of
these problems can remedied by educating family members about the
symptoms and difficulties of OCD and and understanding of what to
expect.
Often times OCD can start out with minor symptoms of checking and
washing. If not treated properly, the symptoms can become more severe to
the point of consuming one's day with rituals of checking and washing.
It is important to find treatment early on before symptoms worsen.

We have worked with a step-by-step scientifically grounded and clinically proven
approach for OCD that harnesses the brain's untapped potential. Founded
at UCLA, this method combines Cognitive Behavioral Method (CBT) with
Mindfulness. To learn more about this method visit http://www.tendingsouls.com/four-step-method/.",OCD
161,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
162,"I can talk about myself and that might give you some insight about OCD.
I first experienced a very mild form of OCD when I was around 16 and that was due to academic pressure at school and by the hullabaloo about the colleges I should get in after I graduate from school.
By the time I reached 19, I gained some obsessions and compulsions — still I didn't realise just yet I might have had developed OCD and took it — as something that everyone around my age experiences.
At around 20— after many nervous episodes due to OCD — when my compulsions started hindering my life — I recognised my OCD and started working towards mitigating and controlling it with proven methods and mental restraint.
Now at 21 — after researching significantly and extensively on mental health — fought my way through a very mentally infuriating time due to OCD — I came about two conclusions about how OCD is developed.
One, the genetic inheritance — I realised it late but observing my dad and grandma’s actions and some memories from my childhood — I realised that they are also in a way suffering from OCD — my dad’s paranoia when a certain compulsion of his is not fulfilled and my grandma’s sudden anxiety attacks due to overthinking fell in the range of obsessions and compulsions. I believe that the OCD that I had cultivated is in some or the other way is inherited through genetics.
Second, the environment around you plays an important role as well. In my case — I had the genes that by getting triggered by outside factors resulted in OCD — that took me by surprise. The pressure of being in an engineering college was daunting and thus my mind began to cultivate notions, obsessions and compulsions — assuring me if I will follow a certain routine — I would be able to survive college.
There are genes and there are many outside factors that our brain perceives as dangerous which helps trigger OCD.",OCD
163,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
164,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

165,"One of the criteria stated in the DSM-IV for OCD is that the obsessions or compulsions cause marked stress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day) or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships.
So basically, whenever the person's everyday, social, academic/occupational life is impaired (this is something the sufferer would have to determine) it is harmful.
Also, perhaps rather obvious, when the compulsions include inflicting physical harm to oneself or others.
OCD sufferers usually experience a large level of discomfort (due to the constant need of having to perform rituals, if they can not perform them, they experience a big amount of stress ) which could also be seen as harmful.
I hope that answers your question.",OCD
166,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
167,"My OCD isn’t as severe as others but my mother tells me she has seen my behavior when I used to play with my toy cars. She tells me how she’d seen me arrange them by color, size, and looks (coolest to suckiest). Even today, my room is a bit more cleaner and organized than the rest of the house bedrooms. I’m the one that is constantly checking things like 3–4 times, just in case of some accident. But my most difficult challenge is unwanted sexual thoughts (everyday), I can’t make them stop and I get really frustrated sometimes because they get too out of hand. It really annoys and bothers me when someone says “Oh yeah I get OCD when this and that”. I’m like, bro, do you even know what OCD means? It’s not something you get every once in a while!

169,"What is the difference between passion and obsession?
Obsession is desultory (uncontrolled jumping from one topic to other, non-cohesive (distraught sometimes elusive, digressed thought, generally lacks strength and purpose) and compulsive in case of OCD.
By the way, OCD and Bipolar are anxiety disorders and are ego-dystonic which is opposite of ego-syntonic disorders (ego-syntonic = blissfully unaware what inconvenience is being caused to others, ego-dystonic = aware and causes irritation to self and others)
People employ bodyguards to protect and feel secure.
Similarly if you monitor your thoughts consciously like a security guard and do activities where focus and obsessive attention is required, you can achieve what ordinary people cannot even contend with you.
Guided obsessive thoughts can do things which cannot be achieved by the ordinary folks. My boss gets very unique solutions which he often doesn’t get from elsewhere and he credits my brain and I credit my OCD. If life gives you lemons make lemonade.
Misguided rockets lands in the Bay of Bengal (under ocean), guided rockets gets to the moon and more.
Work on protein synthesis, by having amines (vit-AMINES). This produces serotonin (natural anti-depressant) and having plenty of sunlight (vit-D3) and vit-B12. The above also produces tryptophan. Avoid synthetic sugar post sunset, excessive alcohol.
Unless it is extra deep rooted it may take many years to get rid of OCD.
But having you (super hero) at the helm of things it can be guided. Its a known fact that generally people with higher IQ are target of mental disorders.
Which also means that if you have developed OCD you have a higher IQ than average.
I hope that helps. Good luck with the way you deal with it.",OCD
170,"I got possessed by some unseen supernatural powers when I was young. Hailing from a decent family, everyone including myself thought it to be a psychiatric issue and sought help from my uncle who was a neurosurgeon. Even after 6 months of meds, my condition never improved. I felt drugged all the time due to severe side effects of the psychiatric meds I had been prescribed. Belonging to a hindu family, I was taken to a saint who was a Krishnaa devotee. He treated me with holy water , asked me to chant Lord Hanuman's name (god's name) in meditation. Though it took 5-6 months , but finally I got treated.
As pointed out by the saint, the reasons for possession are->1) Not being chaste/ celibate
2) Eating meat & non-veg food, which are the foods of ghosts/ jinns/ bad spirits
3) Not meditating on God's name, which is the biggest deterrent against possession and invisible powers
[One can chant any God's name of his/her religion/faith, but should be done in meditation with eyes closed to see instant effect. The longer one does it, the more benefit one will see(min 15 minutes a day). Also strict physical celibacy is needed; else meditation on God won't show results]
The Mental disorders that I got rid of after following the above rules->
1) Heavy head
2) Sleeplessness/ severe insomnia- I could not sleep for 8-10 months in a row & no meds could make me fall asleep either
3) Vivid nightmares , which occurred every time I tried to sleep. [Bad supernatural powers cause bad dreams, like falling from cliff, you/ family members getting killed]
4) Shouting violently when asleep even for a moment
5) Throwing arms & legs in dreams
THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS MOSTLY CAUSE MENTAL DISORDERS , WHICH RESEMBLE A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. SO ITS DIFFICULT TO DETECT.
According to the saint, jinns/spirits are in the form of air in this world & are invisible to humans on an average spiritual level . (But once a person comes on a very high spiritual level through strict 'celibacy' & meditation on God over lifetime, he/she attains spiritual powers to see these evil creatures) . Also, these jinns/spirits can attack only the people at low/average spiritual level (ie, who are not chaste/ don't meditate on God's names), that means, they can attack almost everyone on earth, as most of us don't lead a spiritual life. They attach themselves to the person's nervous system as well as circulatory system. They tend to play with the two organs- brain & heart.
The reason for attachment is to get Pleasure out of your body. So, to get pleasure , these powers first enter your physical body via air & once inside the lungs, move into circulatory system and attach themselves to heart, brain, spinal cord etc. Once attached to your body, they get the pleasure that you're getting through food etc (So celibacy is a strict criteria as these creatures like sex pleasures through one's body).
Possession varies ( the % of body getting possessed), & thus can be classified into partial possession and complete possession. Partial possession if not controlled through strict celibacy & meditation will surely move to a full possession in which the possessed person will lose entire control over his body & mind.
Also possession never starts from full directly; it always progress from slight to partial to complete. However , if one reached to a complete possession state, the jinn/spirit has complete command over your body & can do/say anything through your body. In that case, the victim's claims of seeing other beings, creatures, etc. is not what the victim sees, but what actually the spirit sees
After going through the possession, I now believe in both science and spirituality. It has made me much stronger. I also cracked CAT in my first attempt & converted 3 of the IIMs (prestigious MBA college in India).
Also , I've extensively written this article so that anyone who faces any such issue , easily identifies the same & applies the above remedies to his/her benefit. :) :)",OCD
171,"Yes, when you are trying to direct your life from fear, you become compulsive, etc. It is acting out from the lack of accepting “ Thy Will Be Done.” I can not play God, or protect me, I have to surrender to the love of the universe for my needs to be met and I can rest in the presence of love. give up your fears, resentments, and anger to allow your heart to open and fill you with love and direct your way.
In the last few days, I found out more about my OCD which caused me a big concern. I found it comes from me from trying to be perfect as I always felt I was less then others. If I am perfect maybe I would be loved and liked.
This is also called pride or wearing a mask to look good to others when inside I am totally distraught trying to be part of life. I had to get honest with myself and release the pride which is a false cover and drop the mask to look good and feel that I am good enough to others. My actions did not support the real me that always has been good enough in God’s eyes and love me with all my short comings.",OCD

173,"While I am not a psychologist I can tell you my personal opinion and experience says yes. Being Buddhist we speak much about this. I think if you read a bit about Buddhism, specifically Tibetan Buddhism you will find that this is a root belief. One can go further in says it is not only a belief or theory but fact. I will not attempt to argue that but I will try to explain it.
At my Temple we have had Many doctors attend on various occasions. They are more open minded to Buddhist philosophy than in the past.
In Buddhism we have 31 planes of existence. The Thirty-one Planes of Existence
There are Hellish realms, ghostly realms, animal realms, our realm known as the plane of desire, and higher realms as well.
The realm in which we reside, is the 5th of 31. The goal or belief is to avoid rebirth which would have us return to this realm. Rebirth is not the same as reincarnation. It is also possible that we descend into a lower realm due to anger, aggression, desire or other bad thoughts and practices.
If you think about it, in our everyday life desire has a lot to do with all that runs society Globally. I generally say Psychology is the most powerful agent in society.
It is most often about what we want. What we seek. We desire, pleasure, calm, and being content and happy.
Companies use advertisements to try to persuade you to purchase their products, they use psychology in doing so. Just as someone running for a position of power desires your vote, they use psychology to try and earn your vote. This is all based on desire.
There are many other examples, but if you look around we always desire. It is hard to avoid. What can happen with OCD is one becomes obsessive in what they can not have. Be it a situation, a feeling, an object or anything else. Desire feeds desire. This is a feedback loop and a cycle that is difficult to break. Suffering and desire generally go hand in hand.
From a Buddhist perspective this is one of the more difficult challenges we often face. This is why we practice meditation. There are many forms of meditation. The one that has the most benefit is the empty mind. Concentration on nothing, clearing all thoughts and purging our subconscious of these thoughts has a lasting effect.
These are techniques used by some psychologist, generally as part of CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
It does work however as with anything it requires effort. So often now we want to take a pill and change the chemistry of our brain to solve a mind issue. In some cases that may be the only solution so I never disagree with that. It is however important to try to resolve issues with other approaches that do not require medication or a combination of both.
From a Christian perspective, yes it there is also a spiritual component as well. There are many verses that speak of different desire and obsession in the Bible. I lean a bit more toward the Catholic perspective on this ( while today that may seem like a contradiction in terms. LOL).
Any good Priest would speak to great length about this topic as it is one that is embedded in just about every religion.
Is a spiritual approach the correct approach? Well not for everyone. It really depends on the person. From a Buddhist perspective we believe to live is to suffer, we want to avoid that, but we must accept it.
I would not try to push a spiritual solution upon anyone that is not spiritual, it will not work. The person has to be open minded and willing to accept this into their therapy.

I think in the end the answer to your question is it depends. It depends on the person. Each Religion or Philosophy will say yes in almost every case. That however does not mean that each and every person will accept that. Is that wrong? No, An atheist would say , your crazy just go to a good psychiatrist and try the medication he prescribes. And , that has worked fine for some.
I do believe it is important to find yourself and understand what you believe and have faith in. That can be an important cornerstone to the success of any treatment be it for addiction, behavioral issues or just life in general.

176,"Howdy Sean,
I’m not sure if anyone is following this anymore. But I feel that I might be able to help as I have suffered with OCD for many years and have made significant progress in the last 6 months.
I have read so many articles and watched countless videos on the topic of enlightenment as well as other psychology and spiritual material trying to find answers, which in some ways has contributed to the sufffering that I have gone through because there are a lot of different points of views and beliefs etc.
Having said that, I cannot comment on enlightentment and if you will achieve it or if I will, because I haven’t experienced it yet. But from what I have read and viewed, they do say that enlightenment is total dis identification with thought. Not meaning that you no longer have thoughts, you’re just no longer effected by them in a suffering way.
I, myself have found something that really does work, as Jon mentioned above, and that is awareness and where you place your attention.
I have found that every thought that I have automatically grabs my attention because for so many years, being identified with thinking, every thought has been important. They’re not, trust me on that. So basically what I do is when I become aware of a thought coming up, I accept that it is there, and divert my attention to the feeling of my breathing in my nostrils. If there is any feeling (emotions or slight pain) in my body, I allow them to be there without resisting them or judging them in any way at all.
The thing is, whatever you resist, will persist. So if you have a thought process that you don’t like, and you think, I don’t want this, or why am I experiencing these thoughts. They will continue, because you are feeding them more energy by thinking about them. But if you acknowledge that they have come up, don’t judge them and see them as only a thought and gently divert your attention to your breathing, they eventually get the picture that there is no need for them to be there. I have released a lot of thought process that I use to have that use to control me.
I will be honest with you, some days are harder than others because as I said earlier, thoughts have a way of being seductive and pulling your attention in, but if you remind yourself to divert your attention back to the breathing, then you’re doing amazing each time and making progress to dis identifying with your thoughts.
I also believe that most of our thought patterns, we have learnt from everyone else and can be unlearnt as well. because at one point in our lives, we weren’t thinking some of the horrible shit that we think now. but those people we learnt how to think from, they done the same thing from others that they trusted and it goes on and on and on. No-one is at fault. it is all unconscious learning of useless beliefs, opinions and views of the way things are or how they should be, when in reality, everything is as it is. Simple
Anyway, I hope this helps somewhat :)",OCD
177,"No. OCD is a learned disorder. It can be cured by psychiatric treatment.
It is time we stop believing in spirits/possession in this modern world. Your question uses the word ""spiritual"" is a wrong meaning. Spiritual has nothing to do with ghosts and spirits.",OCD
178,No . Dimensions are something a different topic to talk though. OCD is just a error in the filter in your brain which filters out intrusive thoughts. For me it's not even illness it's just a behaviour pattern for some individuals . Btw it hurts too much . It tortures me daily but i will conquer it .,OCD
179,"Does OCD (Obsessive Compulsive disorder) have a spiritual dimension?
I would say so, yes — if you are willing to see it in this way.
OCD is experienced as a lack of autonomy, helplessness, the feeling of having no choice or power, the feeling of being forced — compulsion.
“I feel like I just have to do these things, even if I don’t want to.”
“If I don’t keep re-locking the door, it just doesn’t feel safe.”
It is also experienced as doubt.
“Did I lock that window? … I did, but it doesn’t feel locked, let me lock it again.”
“Are my hands clean? I just washed them, but they don’t feel clean. Are they really clean? Let me wash them again.”
The experience of autonomy—or not—and the experience of doubt, clearly have a spiritual dimension, no?
Who has not wrestled with the question of whether or not we have choice or free will, the degree to which our behavior is determined?
Who has not wrestled with doubt in God or in spiritual realities, in general?
The particular emotional syndrome, of which OCD is an exaggerated manifestation, is very similar to what one experiences during a spiritual crisis. However the “spiritual version” of OCD, if I can talk about it that way, is less robotic, more refined, more heady/hearty as opposed to the behavioral syndrome that is OCD.
Look at an insect, perfectly programmed like an OCD victim. Whatever its program tells it to do, it does. I am hard pressed to believe that insects have any experience of autonomy.
Look at a human—filled to the brim with the experience of autonomy (whether or not they have it, absolutely). Yet frequently finding that in practice, their habits and programming make them feel almost robotic.
Do we have autonomy, or not?
Is there a God? And if so, do I have any choice?
Is it All God? And if so, is my choice an illusion?
Are we forced, or is there true Freedom?
These are potent spiritual questions.
May all sufferers of OCD feel these powerful questions in their heart and make maximal value of their affliction!",OCD
180,"It makes no sense to divide up a non-uniform category in that manner.
There are already some great answers here talking about stressors and pattern formation and neurofunctional implications as well as genetic predispositions and how environment is fundamentally an integral component in gene expression and what someone’s genetic and biofunctional traits mean for their own lives and experiences given circumstances. However, something not discussed nearly so much is how “OCD” is a nonsensical category to try attributing more to one nexus of causes or another.
The idea of “obsessive compulsive disorder” is an imaginary line drawn around a variety of experiences and behaviors which do not all function in the same way and do not all have the same origins. Your question explicitly acknowledges the prospect or a multifactorial origin for these things, but something just as important is acknowledging that no two people will necessarily be having the same experiences or be having experiences for the same reasons or ratios of reasons.
It is a bit like asking “how many people are tall?” — what definition of ‘tallness’ are we using? Should we account for age and population averages and so forth? What we say “OCD” covers or doesn’t cover is arbitrary, changes over time, and inevitably involves heterogeneity. The best we can really do is talk about minimums: what is absolutely required, and what range of contributors is absolutely necessary? To that end, here are a few factoids:
There are no genes or gene combinations required for someone’s experiences to meet the diagnostic criteria for “OCD”. Though genes can be important in some cases, the bottom line is that no genetic component whatsoever is inherently required. This is in addition to how what genes may predispose someone to having certain experiences will depend on their life and situation, so what is or is not a ‘stacked deck’ can partly depend on many things other than the genetic profile itself.
Misdiagnosis is a really big issue with psychiatry. Diagnostic criteria demand that professionals carefully eliminate all medical explanations and pharmacological explanations before giving a psychiatric label instead, but this is rarely done (and even when done well, may still miss a medical problem). This means that some of what gets on the books as “OCD” is actually something else, and genes can often play a bigger role in some of those causes, eg hereditary autoimmune conditions.
There may well be mediators other than or between environmental factors and genes. Insofar as we can even pull those two things apart, perhaps other factors, like personal choice, may be conceptualized as additional actors here. Choice can alter both environment and epigenetic regulation, after all. Perhaps ‘nature vs nurture’ was never a legitimate bifurcation in the first place, even if we were dealing with a unitary phenomenon (which, as explained, we are not).",OCD

But, and a big BUT! ;
If you think about the real meaning of OCD, it is wanting things in their place, the need to do things to make things orderly, etc. etc.
We all have out little ways of doing things, we would hate it if someone came along, in our private space, and disrupted our order.
I know I like certain things in certain places so I can find them. If I put something down in the wrong place, I know I am looking all over for it. When I was young I would have certain things in a certain order to suit me, not you, or my parents, or Joe Blog. MY WAY.
Yes I do realise that OCD is a problem to some people and every single thing must be just so, and it is classed as not being Normal, whatever that is supposed to mean, but should we be allowed to do things our way?
I know that when we are at school we have to follow orders and keep thing flowing, same as when working.
If you think about MacDonald’s, they have their method of putting a burger together to give the end result, but was that OCD of the person who started it?
All companies have their procedures, the way it is supposed to be done to create productivity and make things look good to eat/use.
Hitler and all the others wanted it their way, but it was the way they did it, that made it a bad thing.
To me the worst person of all people who owned one of the now, largest companies, was Walt Disney.
He was the only one that could have any facial hair, everything had to be done his way, not anyone else’s, and the rules and regulations go on and on, to the point of being ridiculous, in my opinion.
Did he have Bad OCD? or was he just a person who wanted to Rule his world?
This is the way I see OCD being a problem, just because we like to do things out way and not in what some call “normal.” That is why I say What is Normal?
I am still waiting for some brain box who thinks they know what Normal is to tell me. As I see it, it is not the way other people see things, not me, not you.
I will admit it can be a problem and classed as a mental health problem, but I do not see it that way. I think all people should be allowed to organise their space, their way. Who are we to say differently?
The problem becomes a problem when it affects other people and the work routine.
This is my opinion on the Subject of OCD.",OCD
182,"OCD is a serious Neuropsychiatric disorder, one of most difficult disorders to treat.
Like most chronic illnesses, risk factors aren’t only genetic but combination of both genetic ( 50–60%) and environmental.
There are very few 100% genetic disorders like Down’s syndrome, Cystic fibrosis and others.
OCD can be caused by infection and trauma as well. And it is know what areas of the brain are involved in OCD , about 10% of the patients don’t get better and this disease become so disabling that some of them opt for neurosurgery.
I would say some are more biological and some are more environmental, overall 50/50.",OCD
183,"No health problem can be seen simply as either genetics or environment. There is always an interaction between the two. Even cancer has been shown in animal models to not just be a disease of genetics and environmental factors such as viruses and bacteria, but also human handling affects the probability of the cancer developing.
While someone’s predisposition to OCD will undoubtably vary depending on genetics it will also vary on how the person was brought up, their ability to cope with anxiety (emotional regulation strategies), learning experiences and attachment style from key early relationships.",OCD
184,"Hello Jeff. Like most important mental health abnormalities it is usually both with the genetics setting the stage for high anxiety, over-thinking and repetitive rituals. The environmental factors can be beliefs that are cultural, religious, and parental instruction on what a good person looks and acts like. Sometimes these expectations are excessive leading to OCD to prevent catastrophes in the mind of the sufferer. When fears are abated by hand washing (unless Covid-19 instructions) or filling your purse with every imaginable object for an emergency or never throwing anything away, anxiety is momentarily decreased which is a form of negative reinforcement which is environmental.",OCD
185,"The following research indicates that 4 genes have been discovered that are significantly associated with OCD. Researchers Have Finally Discovered Genes That Are Linked to OCD. ‘ These gene variants are predicted to disrupt synapse development and interfere with neural pathways in an area of the brain called the cortico-striatal loop, messing up things like serotonin and glutamate signalling’. Not everyone with these genes will develop OCD though. Two of these same genes have also found to be of relevance in studies looking at Autistic Spectrum disorder.
There seems to be overlap with genes affecting one mental health disorder also affecting others. In the following recent article: Anorexia not just a psychiatric problem, scientists find ‘The study revealed eight genes that linked anorexia to anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, all of which was expected. ( But it also flagged up DNA involved in burning fat, being physically active and having resistance to type 2 diabetes’)
I don't think it is known which — the genes or the environment is more likely to cause OCD. Mental health illnesses are now considered to be biopsychosocial i.e. in a person with mental illness there is likely to be an combination of biological (including genetic and epigenetic) psychological and social risk factors which are interrelated. ‘Environmental factors such as adverse perinatal events, psychological trauma and neurological trauma may modify the expression of risk genes and, hence, trigger the manifestation of obsessive–compulsive behaviours’. Obsessive–compulsive disorder: an integrative genetic and neurobiological perspective
Thanks Jeff for the A2A",OCD
186,"It’s both. An individual is born with obsessive compulsive tendencies. If the individual experienced early childhood adversity and reacted with a stress response that later became chronic into adulthood, then yes, those tendencies could later express as OCD.
I have O-C traits. I like order and like my belongings to be sorted accordingly. And my thought process is organized accordingly as well. But it just ends there. No full disorder.
So yes there are genes for OCD; however, only chronic stress will allow their full expression.",OCD
187,"OCD can be caused by a number of things, and can be a combination of the following:
A chemical imbalance in the brain
Hereditary factors
A trauma you’ve experienced and/or internalized, especially if you were never able to work through it
PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune disorders associated with streptococcal infections), which is a newer area of interest for a sudden onset of symptoms
Learned behaviors
Other disorders
The cause and factors can vary for each person, which is why it’s important to consult a licensed professional. Treatment can include medication (which will help chemical imbalances) and cognitive behavioral therapy (which helps to retrain your brain on how to handle stress, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts.)",OCD
188,"The ansewer to your question is “yes”. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) causes structural, chemical and functional changes in the brain. It is a biological brain illness. The onset of the illness can be anywhere from a pre-school age up into middle age and beyond. Medical science has found that errors of “communication “ between the frontal lobe (the “thinking” and “executive functioning” part of the brain) and the“reward” and “motivation” part located in the ventral striatum. Even though medicine has developed medicine to lower one’s obsessions and compulsions and even though therapy has been developed to assess and redirect those same things, there is still a lot of the disorder and it’s triggers that we don’t know. So the answer to your question is yes, environment can influence the development of OCD behaviors and obsession in genetically predisposed individuals.",OCD
189,"OCD has nothing to do with genetics. It is a psychological symptom due to a deep (and powerful) feeling of guilt.
These same feelings of guilt are present in neurosis* / Ptsd + Anguis (stronger than anxiety) and too, aggressiveness ( dues to anguish). Thus, when a neurosis is treated, the feelings of guilt disappear and so. OCD.
In psychology as in physical medicine, when you remove the causes (here: neurosis with guilt feelings), the symptoms stop.
*Term still used in psychoanalysis. Strict psychoanalysis ( on the couch), is recommended for cure neurosis / Ptsd and all the many symptoms it generates: anxiety, anguish, addictions, OCD / manias, phobias, feelings of guilt, of inferiority / low self-esteem, eating disorders, excessive shyness, self-sabotage, anti-social behaviors, aggressiveness ( physical and verbal), make down other people, etc …",OCD
190,"Yes, you can do it.
To cure your ocd by yourself you can practice ERP therapy by your own.
By doing ERP you can break the cycle of ocd and once you are break this cycle and then you will be ocd free.
In ERP we face our fear and we will restrict ourself to perform compulsion. which gives us lots of anxiety but slowly slowly you will see that the impact of that fear will become weak if you will not do compulsions and you will observe that with the time and practice of ERP your anxiety is reducing day by day.
Whatever your ocd say , do exact opposite of that thought, don't listen to that thought.
Actually we have programmed our sub conscious mind by doing ocd compulsions, doing one thing repeatedly, or we can say that all our habits are now stored in our sub conscious mind, our sub conscious mind don't ask any questions, it has no logic, it simply stores whatever activities we are doing on daily basis.
So in our mind we have stored doing one thing multiple times because of ocd, now to overcome ocd, we need to reprogram our mind with the right habits of doing anything once only.
To reprogram our sub conscious mind we need to stop doing the compulsion, like Washing hands multiple times.
If we are able to reduce our compulsion, then are able to overcome with this ocd.
All you need to do is to not to do compulsion and if you feel anxiety because of not doing compulsion then you need to replace your anxiety thought with a positive thought and you need to tell your mind that nothing will happen if I will not wash my hands 10 times, nothing will happen and you will see that slowly slowly you will be able to convince your mind with good thought and as sub conscious mind don't question so it simple do whatever you tell.
So in this way you can reprogram your sub conscious mind with new habits and with the practice of ERP regularly you can live a ocd free live.

192,"Ocd can be dealt with using various methods. Meditation, medication, therapy, diet etc. Or so they say. In my opinion, nothing beats therapy or a combination of therapy and medicine.
If you want to beat ocd without going to a psychiatrist, firstly determine that it is indeed ocd. How do you know it is? Sometimes self diagnosis may prove counter productive. But you can do the ybocs test and find out. Free test, available online.
Secondly, read up on exposure and response prevention. It isn't easy but you can try doing it yourself.
Then, read Brain Lock. It tells you how to beat ocd at home. Again, not easy, but theoretically, can be done.
But the best way is to of course consult a professional.
All the best. If you want you can write to me privately for more clarity. My id is in my bio. All the best.",OCD
193,"Actually Abishek Iyengar is right. Seek professional help immediately...!
But here are some tips and techniques to control your urges of ritualized behavior...!
1. Recognize : Recognize your anxiety, compulsive behavior... This self realization goes a long way in controlling the compulsive urges..!
2. Re-attribute : The recognized compulsive behaviors, urges or intrusiveness needs to be attributed to OCD. Its like keep telling yourself... ""This is not me.. My OCD is making me do this... I should stay away from my OCD...""
3. Refocus...: Do something else, when you anticipate a OCD ... For example... if you are a compulsive checker... i.e. like if you keep checking the locks several times ... tell yourself.. I am not responsible for securely locking... Its someone else's responsibility...I am doing a favor checking it for him..."" or just tell someone to lock the door and don't do it yourself...!
4. Revalue : The obsession or OCD is not significant in itlsef. Keep telling yourself that its not me.. its my stupid obsession...! Revalue the intensity of your anxiety.
How would you do that?
Write down your obsessive thoughts or worries
Anticipate OCD urges
Practice relaxation techniques
Adopt healthy eating habits
Exercise regularly
Get enough sleep
Reach out for support like family, friends, support groups...!",OCD
194,"Depends on a lot of things. I don't know how severe your OCD is, I don't know if you've been formally diagnosed, I don't know how long and in what manner your OCD manifests itself. So, keep all these things in mind as you read the answer. I don't think you can make it completely go away but you can definitely learn to manage it better.
So, if your main concern about going to a psychiatrist is that they may prescribe medication then I think you should go to a psychiatrist and get a formal diagnosis and you should also address your concerns to the psychiatrist about why don't want medication. Usually if it is extremely severe and debilitating, medicine is prescribed. Medication is prescribed because it will help you to calm your anxiety when you don't engage in your rituals and this in turn will help you to free yourself a bit from these rituals (your compulsions).
If that doesn't sound good to you, you may also go to a clinical psychologist who will be able to diagnose you. If you've already been diagnosed, you can go to a clinical psychologist or a counsellor and they may help you with techniques you can use to manage your OCD more efficiently. I strongly recommend you go ahead with this option.
If you want to try something at home, you can try practicing mindfulness at home. What is done in mindfulness is that you're encouraged to live only in the present moment completely. Engage in this moment with all of your senses eyes, ears, nose, skin and tongue. When you get an anxious thought, don't try to push it away or work against it. Just acknowledge it and feel it as it is in the moment. This may be painful initially, but as you keep acknowledging and accepting it, you'll learn more about your anxiety. You could even try talking to your anxiety and asking it what it wants and take it further from there. It is best if you do this with a counsellor.
Second thing you can do at home is practice relaxation. So there's something called progressive muscle relaxation that counsellor's teach you. You can try finding how to do it online and practice it everyday.
If you go to a counsellor they can help you change your behavior and learn new more adaptive behaviors. So despite everything I've said you can try please please please I urge you to seek help from a mental health professional. If you want, you can message me and I may be able to help you in that regard.",OCD
195,"To be honest. I did it with shear will-power it wasn’t easy at all. I just told myself that i need to accept it every morning until one day it was completely gone without me knowing. Then i actually remember it’s been quite a well since i had any intrusion thoughts. it took me about 2 months to accept it and till this day i’m perfectly fine.
It’s different for everyone and not something i’d wish upon anyone. My mind was working overtime 24/7. But i’m glad that will power actually worked, because i didnt want medication.
But please remember to get over OCD. you need to accept that you have it to move forward.",OCD
196,"Hi sweetheart. Of course you can. I am at the end of my Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT), and it has worked wonders. I have almost no OCD left.
The one thing that people misunderstand with this treatment is that they tell you that you will never recover completly. Well, they’re wrong. Let’s say that your OCD is 100%, mine is now 20%, and the average normal person is 5%.
Everybody has 5% in terms that everybody get intrusive thoughts now and then, and everyone has the feelinh that “Ugh, it’s not good enough. Better do it one more time.” The difference is that they don’t bother with the self loathing. They just do it, or just ignore those intrusive thoughts like anything else or think it’s rather funny that they were capable of thinking of drowning their friend in anger. That is where we come in. We never let it go, or vi so our compulsions until our hands are raw and bleeding. We feel like we are forced to, instead of feeling that it would be good to to it.
So, no one is 0% OCD. And you need to remember that. This will help you. Because you will get urges and thoughts like everyone else, but with the list under you will also learn how to ignore those thoughts and go about your day as everyone else. 5% is good. Embrace your 5%, okay?
Now. How to get to 5%?
First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems. The best treatment is Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT). Because if you do try to overcome this alone, you will relapse multiple times resulting in a worse relapse every time. I can speak on behalf of my self and thousands of other people with OCD or compulsive behavior.
Second you should make a private list of your goals and then work it out together with your appointed doctor. The list should include:
* Why do I want this?
* Who am I doing it for? (The answer should ALWAYS be yourself, but you have to mean it a 100%)
* A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
* Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
* Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
* Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
* As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
* Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
* If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
* Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your...

197,"You can't. You really can't. You might be able to manage your symptoms, even survive through the pain, but the real answer is that you can't wish away or think away an essentially physical problem, which is what OCD is.

198,"It’s very unlikely. I guess anything is possible, but OCD is, for some people, a severe and disabling condition. It’s not a character flaw or a bad habit that can just be overcome by sheer willpower. I suppose to some extent, everyone can (or at least should be able to) control their behaviors. So if anything, you may be able to reduce or stop yourself from performing some compulsions, since those are generally (but not always) actions/behaviors. I don’t think you can control your obsessions because those are thoughts. If thoughts were easy to ignore or stop, then there would be no need to psychologists or psychiatrists, right?
Also, if you are able to stop your compulsions, which might be behaviors or actions, what might end up happening is that you develop mental compulsions. Since those are thoughts, no one but you would know that you are doing them. So to onlookers, you might appear better, but you might actually be worse - more consumed by unwanted thoughts and mental rituals.
Also, my understanding is that the more you try to push away unwanted thoughts, the more they occur. Therapists have always told me when OCD thoughts are really bad, don’t try to argue with the thoughts. Don’t try to push them away. It just won’t work. The better option is distraction, but not actively fighting the thoughts. Let the thoughts be there, just don’t focus on them. But don’t ignore them. It’s hard for sure. So I guess I don’t know how you’d even propose overcoming OCD with ‘force of will’. If that means arguing or fighting with the thoughts, I’d have to say no, that won’t work. If it means distracting, not giving into the compulsions, noticing the thoughts, but not focusing on them…then maybe.",OCD
199,"Premise : I have OCDs; not one, not two, but dozens of them. But I have trained myself to have full self-control.
Main : The truth about OCDs is that not all OCSs are bad. Take the case of 1 hour compulsory gym/yoga everyday which turned into a healthy habit, or washing hands thrice before eating food. These are actually good in a longer run. Other OCDs can not only be unhealthy but also lead to unnecessary wastage of time(in case of masturbation) and money(in case of shopaholics).
In order for anyone to overcome OCDs, one needs to practise self-control. These might help :
Note down your OCDs, be true to yourself. List them.
Observe yourself in a passive manner, judge your actions and add points to the “The list of OCDs to conquer”.
When you are in a situation that your behaviour begins to fall into the pattern of one of the OCDs, do nothing. Literally stop doing whatever hou are and think. Why are you doing this, would it give you three things : Time, Health, Money? NO? Stop doing it, Say it to yourself. Try saying this infront of mirror looking directly into your eyes.
Contemplative meditation is a good way to practice self-control, unless this itself appends to the list.
Do NOT believe in making lists. Shun every chain, break the shackles of your mind by taking control over it. Thus, once you control your mind, you shall have full control over your body, and as a result control over the OCDs.

200,"Oh Sir! I have exactly the same type of OCD. I often see people connecting OCD to germs and cleanliness, but I also dont have that kind. Mine is exactly the same as yours, the repetition one. I am 23 now. I remember approximately, that when I was in 9th grade my repetitive writing started, and when I was in 1st year of college(during treatment), my repetitive writing stopped. I have to compulsively think a lot of things, before doing some work, and also multiple reassurances needed. There is one difference, I did not reach the position u r at, I have completed engineering and am struggling in my job since the past few months. Since the past few days, I am thinking this only that how could I complete my studies if I cannot do my job, and found the answer that, if people need more time that others, then they can complete studies and assignments and courses, but in the industry, competition exists and slow minded people like me cannot work at that pace. My mind runs fast, and I have to think so many things, that productively, i get slow. I got my job 10 months back as a software developer, from that I degraded to testing, and now I am just a test executer, and sometimes I have to listen a lot from my seniors for my mistakes, in that work too. I seriously dont know what to do now or in the near future, was just searching for answers for questions like mine, on quora, and found yours. It is not that I have not tried treatment, but after so many instances of treatments and relapses I dont have the energy nor the commitment to work on it. I just left it how it was. I really want to know more about you, as I dont know what to do with me.",OCD
201,"Probably the best investment you can make is to find a therapist with a lot of experience in helping people with the combination of OCD and perfectionism. Find someone who has also worked with psychiatrists who prescribe medications for OCD. This is not as difficult as it seems. If you think you can't afford this, think about what it will cost you if you don't get your OCD and perfectionism under control.
A well-qualified therapist will help you to strategize ways to keep your behaviors within bounds. She will also help you find other ways to reduce anxiety (OCD is an anxiety disorder; perfectionism is a response to anxiety/fear too). From the get-go, your therapist will suggest techniques you can use to deal with your tendency toward perfectionism. To be successful, you need to practice these techniques conscientiously and report back on what works and what doesn't. And the therapist will work with you to quiet your obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviors that are part of your fear of not doing something ""perfectly."" Most specifically, she will work with you until you are able to meet deadlines consistently. Learning how to do something to a quality less than what you are capable of doing with infinite time takes time and practice. After all, how will you decide what you will deliberately not do that you know would make the work turn out better? Part of that answer is that you have a hard cutoff, so you do the best you can before the deadline.
You seem to have learned that there are few if any consequences for missing deadlines. As you anticipate, in the world of work, there ARE consequences and one of them can be that you lose your job. Also understand that in most workplaces, there is a mantra: ""The perfect is the enemy of good-enough."" More is often not better. Optimization across quality, quantity, resources, completion dates, etc. is the goal. Quality at all costs is failure-- the opposite of perfect.
Because you are clearly also depressed, I encourage you to find a therapist as soon as possible. I have no medical or psychiatry credentials whatsoever. It doesn't take that kind of education to know that suicide is not a good answer for a disability like OCD. OCD is controllable and life can be oh-so-much better when you've learned how to deal with OCD and perfectionism in healthy ways. I say that based on a very long life of personal experience.",OCD

Stop babysitting this damn illness. It's taken much of your life and energy already; give it no more. Try to do what you'll have to do anyway at 80 years old if you keep on like this: refuse to cater to the OCD and push on through with your task at hand. Do not let yourself fall into subservience to it - else you'll be re-reading and re-writing till the end of time.",OCD
203,"OCD is a truly painful condition and I am sorry for anyone who has to endure it. I first started experiencing symptoms when I turned twelve. Since my intrusive thoughts are religious in nature, my condition went undiagnosed until I turned sixteen.
I honestly thought that I had lost touch with reality; I remember feeling like everywhere I went these thoughts would follow me. I felt that I could not really explain my problem to anyone because they would not understand it, and when I tried to…they didn’t.
Finally, when I found out that OCD can be of a moral/scrupulous nature, I was able to understand what was happening to me. My parents took me to a Psychologist and I received an official diagnosis.
After I learned that my thoughts were the result of a mental condition and were not going to go away, I remember feeling extremely depressed. I thought that I would always grapple with this issue and had been handed a mental millstone to carry around.
Then, I started going to therapy. My therapist utilized exposure-response prevention and helped me to rewire my brain. Even though I had known before that my thoughts were irrational, I felt like my brain was finally starting to understand that too. I started to notice that the “volume” of my thoughts became lower and I was able to function better. I had an easier time sleeping and eating, and I felt like I could enjoy being around my friends.
There are many people who suffer from anxiety conditions, which I am sure you know. “Normal” anymore is subjective and most people aren’t. I am just one person and my experience may not be yours, but I can say that my quality of life has significantly improved since getting professional help.
I still have thoughts that bother me, but have experienced significant relief from my symptoms. Some are able to achieve complete remission.
In short, a good life is possible despite having OCD.",OCD
204,"Stop trying. Suspend every single effort to “figure it out” and simply prioritize “learning to live with it”
Give it no more power over your emotions than something that you view casually and dispassionately.
Come to terms with the fact that you’re focusing on sensory stimuli, and then accept it. It won’t harm you, though your reacting to the fear might, and everything it tells you is false.
It’s like the Devil’s Snare from Harry Potter. Fighting the presence is what gives it presence. The only way out of the prison is to stop trying to escape. I know that’s counter-intuitive. It’s hard to act on when you’re dealing with ego-dystonic thoughts, but it is the only thing that will help you here.
It might also help to learn about how internal compulsions and rituals work.
If you think about a future event and start catastrophizing, thinking “I’m not going to be able to focus on this because of my sensorimotor OCD” and then avoid that activity, you’ve engaged in a compulsive ritual. It’s not the sensorimotor OCD causing you to lose things. It’s the avoidance tied to triggers that makes the disorder so disabling.
You can’t control what you think, but you can control how you react to it.
Focus on not needing to understand it. Fixate instead on achieving “calm” in an abstract manner, making whatever moves are necessary to reduce your anxiety levels.
Most importantly of all, remember.. the thoughts are temporary. Impermanent. Check again in 5 minutes and you’ll see that you spent 4 of those 5 minutes focused on rumination, not actually engaging in the stimulus.
You will never escape this mental prison by actively trying to escape. That will only make it worse.
Instead, you must learn to tolerate it.
Even seeking treatment can have a paradoxical effect of adding weight to the fears.
Minimize your response to it. Learn to process it neutrally or positively. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on a specific sensory stimulus, be it breathing, swallowing, blinking, whatever. What’s wrong is your internal narrative. You’re stuck in this because you’re telling yourself that you’re stuck in this. Learn not to do that. Let go of the idea of tangible episodes and simply allow yourself to have good days and bad days. It’ll be your greatest weapon in learning to live with this type of OCD.
The main problem you’ll face is relapse after remission. OCD won’t be cured. It can’t be cured. If you really stop to think about it, you’ll probably realize that this fixation on hyperawareness is actually pervasive throughout your life, and always has been. You can definitely reduce the symptoms, and quite plausibly eliminate the associated suffering, but.. you can’t rewire the part of your brain that evolved to have this problem. You can only learn to live with having the problem. As soon as you’re past the sensorimotor component of your OCD, it’ll shift to another topic. That can’t be stopped. You’ll always have free-floating OCD. It’ll latch onto whatever the hell it needs to in order to convince you that you have a problem.
But you don’t.
Your only problem is this concrete belief in the existence of a problem, largely created by a misinformed intent to “control” thoughts - something that is not possible. There’s also a degree of magnetism with severe OCD. Those with severe OCD are generally more comfortable having problems than being problem-free.
tl;dr - Learn to befriend the OCD.",OCD
205,"I’d have to say first and foremost the thing that perks my ears up more than anything else, is when I hear someone say “I have OCD.”
Because I have OCD, I pay a lot of attention to detail -more than most people. So when someone says something like that, I can study their mannerisms very quickly and realize if they're full of shit.
The greatest is when someone says “I’m so OCD.” Like hell man, let's just get rid of the acronym for a moment.
I am obsessive compulsive disorder.
WOW! You're a disorder? I would've never guessed!
One thing that people do not realize is that OCD is an anxiety disorder. I'm not just malcontent with having a dirty binder or a ketchup stain on my shirt or other pointless things.
It is that when I tap my fingers on the desk, my fingers must line up (middle on right, middle on left. Then tap index on right, then index on left). Repeat. Sometimes I do more complex patterns such as 3–3–2–2–4–4–5–5–1–1–1–1–5–5–4–4–2–2–3–3. I’ll then repeat that over and over. The number of times each finger strikes the table must be the same amount or it will make me feel uneasy.
Any time that I eat something like grapes or gummies I will separate out the colors and assure that they are in even amounts. One red gummy on both sides, one green gummy on both sides. If I end up with an odd amount or something unpaired, it is bitten in half in the most convenient way and then separated to each side. This is something I ALWAYS do.
Another thing is the curse of unwanted thoughts. Everyone has unwanted thoughts, but not like obsessive compulsive ...

207,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

208,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
209,"The answer is yes.
OCD is your mind lying to you, telling you that you are some how magically protected, and thereby soothed. OCD feels like superstition run amok. Sometimes, it’s just a nuisance, but many times, it feels like being in hell, trapped in rituals or behaviors you don’t want to do, but must do anyway, that you have no will, nor the power to stop, and if you did somehow find a way, something horrible will happen as a result. I know these things, because I lived through these things, and it took a horrible tragedy to put me on the path of healing. I hope within my answer, you’ll find enough to get through yours without it taking such a tremendous loss to push you.
I can look back now and be certain that I’ve been OCD since a very young age, beginning with a horrible fear of the dark, even well into my early adulthood. I can vividly recall many episodes of rechecking locks, doors, lightswitches, and other things in my early teens. I remember counting how many swallows of water or any other liquid: it always had to be seven for awhile, then eight for some reason, and many other things which took away my ability to be in the moment. It was like having a phantasm always haunting me, always reminding me, always distracting me, always taking from me, and never giving me anything in return. I could never just go to bed, or do a simple task, or go anywhere without having to “do it right”, which often meant doing it over and over and over until it FELT right, and even then, some nagging doubt remained, draining away my energy, draining away my life.
The absolute worst was about 6 or 7 years ago, when it literally took me 8 or 9 or 10 or 11 hours before I could satisfy my phantasm and actually go to bed, night after night after night of hellish compulsion to do things that made no sense, like cleaning the same spot over and over, or closing the door “just right” with no idea of what “just right” was, other than knowing it when I felt it, all the while being more miserable than I’d ever been. Actually, now that I think about it, tormented describes it better… tormented well beyond the point of exhaustion until I’d finally reach that point of feeling that I’d satisfied whatever “it” was, and could finally sleep. And then waking the next day in dread of what awaited me again and again and again and again, with no end in sight.
I finally got on medication (Zoloft for me), which helped get me past this sheer horror/nightly siege, but still left me back in the slow drain of daily “tasks” and “ways” that I still felt were necessary, which were still considerable, still bothersome, and still non-sensical intellectually.
And then came the day that changed my life: my oldest son, my best friend, who I loved dearly, died from a heroin overdose, and I think the shock of that loss burned so brightly that it cast away the shadows in my mind in which the lies hid themselves, and I began to see them for what they were. I started to challenge those lies with the reality that life will always be unpredictable, that no amount of preparation I could ever do would “protect” me or the ones I love from life, and I surrendered to that truth. And the truth, as they say, set me free. Yes, it took time, and professional help, and hard work, but the momentum built upon itself and knocked each and every one of those compulsions down.
The only way to get past them is through them, by challenging those lies and dealing with the anxiety of not following those compulsions and beliefs until you’re on the other side, where you can look back and see that there was never really anything there to begin with.
And yes, it did dawn on me that they could, perhaps, come back. I realized that the way to deal with that is to be grateful for every day I wake up without them, and live each day to its fullest.
Peace, joy, and strength are waiting for you. It starts with a single step, and another, and another, and then you’ll find yourself walking, then running, until you reach the other side where a warm embrace awaits you.",OCD
210,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

211,"I do not know if I have or have ever had OCD but I have certainly experienced something similar to it and I know (to some extent) how much suffering such problems can cause.
What i realize is that my problem (and possibly OCD as well) is just feelings, urges and habits which normal people don’t have (in some situations, they have it but to a lesser degree). For example, in a particular situation, I may have the urge to check and re-check and feel highly uncomfortable if I don’t whereas normal people will not feel anything and will not have the urge to check.
Actually, there is no problem. Even with all these feelings, urges and habits, I (like normal people) STILL know what i should do, what i shouldn’t do, whether something is necessary or not, etc… I know that I don’t have to check that again or wash that again…It is just that things may not feel right/secure/comfortable.
So the difference between me (including those with similar problems) and normal people is just a difference in feelings/urges/habits which is not a problem because I still know what to do/what not to do/etc…
Since we always know what to do/what not to do/etc…there is actually no problem even though things may not feel right/secure/comfortable all the time. I may not always be able to do things as smoothly as normal people but I am OK.",OCD
212,"I've been suffering from severe OCD since childhood. When I was about 24 (6 years ago) I couldn't take it anymore and went to a psychiatrist.

213,"It is really challenging. I feel like the OCD is even more so to deal with when something is out of ones control. Like, if someone is rude to you, like an ebay buyer was to me yesterday. It took me several minutes of obsessively going over the problem in my head (and out-loud to my poor boyfriend) before I finally said, this, me being upset and frustrated isn't getting me anywhere. This person is not going to change. And no matter what I say, they feel their opinion is correct (however wrong it may be in a room full of peers, or alone). SO, I basically just have to accept it as fact and move on. Realize I can't control and change everything and focus my energy on something that will make me feel better or get me somewhere in life! Like, playing Diablo for example. Another thing that works is going over the negatives and positives. If you find yourself obsessing over for example, not touching a door handle because its littered with germs that could kill you. Will it really kill you? How will wearing a t- shirt over your hand really protect you? And so on and so forth. The more you basically invalidate your fears, the easier it becomes.",OCD

215,"Let’s say you have this annoying roommate.
At first, everything about this roommate puts you off. He talks too much, invades your privacy and often conjures up problems; but as you are just an acquaintance to this roommate at this point of time — you are kind of afraid to directly confront this roommate about how you really feel.
Now, you have been living with this roommate for a while now and you kind of managed to adapt to this roommate’s way of life and don’t really get pissed off on the small things — yet you still couldn't directly tell your roommate about things that are annoying you.
Now, you and your roommate have shared the living space for a respectable amount of time now and you could say that you know your roommate thoroughly — and now you can confront him directly if something annoys you.
This is living with OCD — you are sharing space with it and you cannot ignore it or you cannot really acknowledge everything it says.
Like a roommate — it grows on you — either you can be really fed up with it and fight with it all the time or like a good roommate — understand this OCD which now shares a space in your mind by thoroughly understanding about the fears, anxieties and some common compulsions it enforces you to go through; you can actually live with OCD and might be able to see it as a roommate who is a little annoying but once you get to know its ins and outs — it won’t really affect you majorly.",OCD
216,"OCD means you have fear of thoughts.
To overcome 100% , just understand below things and BOOM, you are free from OCD
No need to stop the negative thoughts.
The more you want to stop it, the more they will come.

So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Thoughts cannot do anything.”
Just focus on taking positive actions only.
Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.
So focus on taking positive actions only.",OCD
217,"I wake up at the same time I do every morning, and make sure I blink exactly ten times before getting out of bed.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay, I’m good. Everything’s good.
I get up, walking to the kitchen (left, right, of course I have to keep track) and pour myself a bowl of cereal. Always tap the side of the box three times before opening it. Then I finish getting ready in the exact right order. No brushing my teeth before getting dressed. No brushing my hair before I eat. Then, I walk to the bus stop. Make sure not to step on any cracks in the road on the way. Wait for a few minutes for the bus to come, repeatedly making sure I have my phone and wallet every thirty seconds or so.
Once I’m on the bus, I make sure the moment I sit down that my phone, wallet, and bus pass are still there. My phone is always in my left pocket and my wallet and bus pass are always in my right. Why do I check? Is it because I’m afraid someone stole them, or that they fell out of my pockets, or that I forgot them at home even though I know that they’re there because I’ve already checked a half dozen times since walking out the door?
Yes. All of those reasons, no matter how irrational I know they are.
Try not to draw attention to my leg bouncing up and down, especially if there’s someone sitting beside me. Oh god, they noticed, they think I’m weird and that I’m a freak oh my god oh my god…
This is the first hour of my day, every day. School can be much worse.
I’m not medicated. I don’t get to go to therapy. I can’t even get my dad to believe that OCD is real and that my problems are genuine. The only way that I cope with OCD is support from (some) amazing friends and breathing exercises I learned in yoga that are supposed to help you relax. Believe me, I wish there was a way to cope better with my OCD.",OCD

Obsessions are unwanted, repetitive,intrusive thoughts or images and compulsions are like repeating hand washing, cheque the lock of door, gas stove etc.your second question is how to get rid of it. Consult a psychiatrist and psychologist. Psychiatrist will give you antidepressants like ssris and low doses of antipsychotics. I also have ocd since childhood. I am taking medicine for it now sertraline and olanzapine. I have only obsessions like existencial /Philosphical questions not compulsion. It made me very depressed. I will tell you that ocd persons are more intelligent than average people. You should see video of vishal vardwaj brahma life about meditation. Meditation can really help you.",OCD
220,"I have contamination ocd, religious ocd.
In contamination ocd, you will do one task multiple times, like you will wash your hands, you will clean the desk, you will wash your clothes multiple times, you will start doubting on simple things like if the door is closed or not and you will check the door repeatedly to ensure that Yes door is closed.
In contamination ocd you will feel uncontrollable desire to perform a task repeatedly. You will feel Anxiety whenever someone touch your phone, clothes or anything, if somebody touch your phone, one thought will trigger that his hands are not clean, he might have germs in his hands and he has touched your phone and now your phone is dirty, now because of this thought you will feel anxiety/fear and to reduce this anxiety what you will do is you will sanitize your phone, you will clean your phone, some people wash their phone also , I am also one of them who washed their phones.
In contamination ocd you will feel anxious after touching anything, any single thing because now you are thinking that your hands are not clean because you have touched the door . All you feel is anxiety anxiety and anxiety😰
In religious ocd, you will be noticing bad thought or very bad words about god. Like if you are doing prayer suddenly some bad thought will trigger in your mind related to God and then you will be feeling guilty that how can you think bad about God and then your ocd will tell you to say sorry to God immediately otherwise God wll not forgive you, now you will feel anxiety if you will not say sorry to God and because of your anxiety you will say sorry to God for the bad thought.
So this is related to religious ocd, which I described.
In any type of ocd you will feel anxiety and to reduce your anxiety you will do compulsions repeatedly.
I hope you will understand how you feel when you have ocd.

221,"Part 1 of 5:Recognizing Common Features of OCPD
1. Look for an emphasis on efficiency, perfectionism, and rigidity.
People with OCPD are perfectionists. They are overly disciplined and preoccupied with processes, procedures and rules. They spend a great deal of time and energy in planning, but their perfectionism may keep them from actually accomplishing tasks.
People with OCPD have an eye for detail and their need to be perfect in each and every aspect pushes them to control every facet of their environment. They can micromanage people despite resistance.
They strongly believe in going by the book and also that rules, processes and procedures are meant to be followed and any deviation from them would result in producing imperfect work.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 1 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
2. Observe how the person makes decisions and completes tasks.
Indecisiveness and an inability to complete tasks are hallmarks of people with OCPD. Because of their perfectionism, a person with OCPD has a strong urge to exercise caution in trying to decide what, when, and how things need to be done. They will often research the most minute of the details irrespective of relevance to the decisions at hand. People with OCPD are extremely averse to impulsivity or risk-taking.
This difficulty with decisions and tasks extends even to very small things. Precious time is lost in weighing the pros and cons of each proposition, no matter how minor.
The emphasis on perfection also causes people with OCPD to perform tasks repetitively; for example, a person might proofread a document for work 30 times and thus fail to get it in on time. This repetition and the person’s unreasonably high standards often cause dysfunction for them in the workplace.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 2 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
3. Consider how the person interacts in social situations.
People with OCPD can often come across to others as ""cold"" or ""heartless"" because of their focus on productivity and perfection, to the exclusion of things like social and romantic relationships.
When a person with OCPD does go on a social outing, they will generally not appear to enjoy it, instead worrying about how it could be done better or that they are ""wasting time"" having fun
People with OCPD may also make others uncomfortable during social events because of their focus on rules and perfection. For example, a person with OCPD might become extremely frustrated by ""house rules"" in Monopoly because they are not the written ""official"" rules. The person might refuse to play, or spend a lot of time criticizing others’ play or seeking ways to improve it.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 3 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
4. Observe the person’s sense of morality and ethics.
An individual with OCPD is excessively concerned about morals, ethics and what is right and wrong. They are excessively concerned about doing the ""right thing"" and has very rigid definitions of what that means, with no room for relativity or mistakes. They are constantly worried about any rules they might have broken or which they might have to break. They are usually extremely deferential to authority and will comply with all rules and regulations, no matter how insignificant they may seem.
People with OCPD extend their concepts of morality and values to others. It is unlikely for a person with OCPD to accept that another person, for example from a different culture, could have a sense of morality if it is different from their own.
People with OCPD are often harsh on themselves as well as others. They may see even minor mistakes and infractions as moral failures. ""Extenuating circumstances"" do not exist for people with OCPD.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 4 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
5. Look for hoarding behavior.
Hoarding is a classic symptom of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, but it can also affect people with OCPD. A person with OCPD may refrain from disposing of even those items that are useless or are of little or no worth. They may hoard with an intention that there is nothing that is of no use: ""You never know when this might come in handy!""
This goes from old, leftover food to receipts to plastic spoons to dead batteries. If the person could imagine that there could ever be a reason it might be useful, it stays.
Hoarders truly value their ""treasure"" and any attempts by others to disturb their collection greatly annoys them. The inability of others to understand the benefits of hoarding surprises them.
Hoarding is very different from collecting. Collectors get enjoyment and pleasure out of the things they collect, and they don’t experience anxiety about getting rid of worn-out, useless, or unneeded items. Hoarders generally feel anxiety about discarding anything, even if it is no longer functioning (like a broken iPod).
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 5 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
6. Look for trouble delegating responsibility.
People with OCPD are often perceived as ""control freaks."" They find it very hard to delegate responsibility for a task to others, because the task might not be performed in the way they believe it should be. If they do delegate tasks, they will often provide an exhaustive list of instructions on how to perform even simple tasks like loading the dishwasher.
People with OCPD will often criticise or attempt to ""correct"" others who are doing a task in a way other than they themselves would do it, even if the other technique is effective or makes no difference to the final result. They do not like to have others suggest different ways of doing things, and may react with surprise and anger if this happens.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 6 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
7. Observe the person’s spending behaviors.
People with OCPD not only have trouble getting rid of useless things, they also are perpetually ""saving for a rainy day."" They are usually reluctant to spend money even on necessities because they are worried about saving for a future catastrophe. They may live well below their means, or even in a standard of living that is lower than is healthy, in an attempt to save money.
This also means that they cannot even part from money by giving it to somebody in need. They will usually attempt to dissuade others from spending money too.
This behavior is diagnostic Criterion 7 for OCPD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).
8. Consider how stubborn the person is.
Part 2 of 5:Recognizing OCPD in Relationships
People with OCPD do not restrain themselves from imposing their ideas and views on others, even in situations where most other people would consider such behavior inappropriate. The idea that this kind of attitude and behavior could upset people and lead to friction in relationships often does not occur to them, nor will it stop them from doing what they intend to do.
A person with OCPD is not likely to feel guilty when crossing the boundaries even if it means monitoring, controlling, meddling and intruding into other people’s lives so that there is perfection and order in everything.
They get upset, angry and depressed if other people are not following their directions. They may become angry or frustrated if it seems like people are not aligned with them in their effort to bring everything under control and to make everything perfect.
2. Look for work-life imbalance.
People with OCPD generally spend a considerable part of their waking hours at work—and they do it by choice. They are hardly left with any time for leisure. Their leisure time, if any, is spent on trying to ""improve"" things. Because of this, the person may not have many (or any) friendships.
If a person with OCPD tries to spend their leisure time on a hobby or some activity such as painting or some sports such as tennis, they do not paint or play for the fun of it. They are constantly in the pursuit to master the art or the game. They will apply the same theory to family members and expect them to set out on a pursuit to excel rather than trying to have fun.
This interference and meddling gets on the nerves of the people around them. This not only ruins the leisure time but can cause damage to relationships.
3. Observe how the person displays emotion to others.
For most people with OCPD, emotions are a waste of precious time that could be otherwise used in their quest for perfection. They are generally very tight-lipped when comes to expressing or displaying feelings.
This reticence is also due to a worry that any expression of emotion must be perfect; a person with OCPD will wait for an extremely long time to say anything to do with feelings in order to make sure that it is ""just right.""
People with OCPD may come across as stilted or overly formal when they try to display their feelings. For example, they may try to shake hands when the other person goes in for a hug, or use overly stiff language in an effort to be ""correct.""
4. Consider how the person responds to emotions in others.
People with OCPD not only have trouble expressing emotion, they also have difficulty tolerating its presence in others. People with OCPD may visibly display discomfort in a situation where people are emotional (such as at a sporting event or family reunion).
For example, most people would likely consider greeting a friend whom they haven’t seen in awhile as an exciting, emotional experience. A person with OCPD may not experience it this way, and might not even smile or offer a hug.
They may seem to feel ""above"" emotions and look down on people who display them as ""irrational"" or inferior.
Part 3 of 5:Recognizing OCPD in the Workplace
1. Consider the person’s work schedule.
Satisfying people with OCPD through their work is a herculean task, let alone impressing them. They are the definition of workaholics, but workaholics who make things difficult for others at work. People with OCPD see themselves as loyal and responsible workers and put in long hours at work, even though those hours are often unproductive.
This behavior is a usual practice for them and they expect all other employees in the company to follow suit.
In general, people with OCPD put in long hours at work but are very poor role models. They have an inability to set a good precedent for people working under them and with them. They are more task-oriented and fewer people (relationship) oriented. They cannot strike a balance between tasks and relationship. They often fail at encouraging people to follow them and their directions.
It’s important to acknowledge that some cultures place a very high value on working long hours or spending most of one’s time at work. This is not the same as OCPD.
For individuals with OCPD, it is not a compulsion to work, but a willingness to work.
2. Watch interactions with others.
People with OCPD are rigid and stubborn in how they approach situations, including those with colleagues or employees. They may be ""over involved"" in the personal lives of their coworkers and do not allow room for personal space or boundaries. They will also assume that the way they behave at work is the way everyone should behave.
For example, a manager with OCPD might deny an employee’s request for personal leave because they would not take leave for the reason given. They might believe that the employee’s first loyalty should be to the company, rather than any other obligation (including family).
People with OCPD do not consider that something could be wrong with them and their way of functioning. They view themselves as the epitome of perfection and order; if this attitude irks somebody then it is because they are not dependable and does not believe in working for the welfare of the organization.
3. Watch for signs of interference.
People with OCPD feel that others are not aware of how to do things in a better manner. According to them, theirs is the only way and the best way to do things. Collaboration and cooperation are not valued.
A person with OCPD is likely to be a ""micromanager"" or a terrible ""team player,"" as they will generally try to force everyone to do things their way.
A person with OCPD is not comfortable with letting others do the job their way lest they make mistakes. They are generally reluctant to delegate responsibilities and will micromanage others if they must delegate. Their attitude and behavior convey the message that they do not trust others and does not have confidence in them and their abilities.
4. Look for missed deadlines.
Very frequently, people with OCPD get so caught up in the pursuit of perfection that they miss deadlines, even important ones. They have a lot of difficulty with effective time management because of their compulsive attention to every single minor detail.
Over a period of time their nature, fixations and attitude gives rise to dysfunctional conflicts which push them into isolation as more people tend to express their displeasure at working with them. Their intractable attitude and perception of themselves complicates things at work and can go to the extent of pushing peers/subordinates away from them.
When they lose the support system, they become even more adamant about proving to the others that there is no alternative to how they do things. This can further alienate them.
Part 4 of 5:Seeking Treatment
1. See a mental health professional.
Only a trained mental health professional can diagnose and treat people with OCPD. Fortunately, treatment for OCPD is generally more effective than it is for other personality disorders. An appropriate mental health professional would be a psychologist or psychiatrist; most family doctors and general practitioners do not have the training to recognize OCPD.
2. Participate in therapy.
Talk therapy, and particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), is usually considered to be a highly effective treatment for people with OCPD. CBT is done by a trained mental health professional, and involves teaching the person how to recognize and change unhelpful ways of thinking and behaving.
3. Ask your doctor about medication.
In most cases, therapy is sufficient to treat OCPD. In some cases, your physician or psychiatrist may also recommend a medication such as Prozac, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
Part 5 of 5:Understanding the Disorder
OCPD is also called anankastic personality disorder (depending on where you live in the world). As the name suggests, it is a personality disorder. A personality disorder is where there is ongoing maladaptive patterns of thinking, behaviours and experiences that transcend different contexts and significantly affect much of the person’s life.
As such with OCPD, there is a preoccupation with the need for power and control over one’s own environment. These symptoms must involve a pervasive pattern of a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, interpersonal and psychological control.
Such control must come at the expense of efficiency, openness and flexibility as there is a strong level of rigidity in one’s beliefs that often interferes with the ability to complete tasks.
2. Distinguish between OCPD and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
3. Recognize the diagnostic criteria for OCPD.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V) states that in order to have the diagnosis of OCPD, the patient needs to have four or more of the following symptoms present in a variety of contexts that interferes with the individual's life:
Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost
Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because their own overly strict standards are not met)
Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)
Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)
Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value
Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly their way of doing things
Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes
Shows significant rigidity and stubbornness
4. Recognize the anankastic personality disorder criteria.
Similarly, the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Disease 10 specifies that the patient must satisfy the general diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder (as mentioned above) and have three of the following symptoms to be diagnosed with anankastic personality disorder:
Feelings of excessive doubt and caution;
Preoccupation with details, rules, lists, order, organization or schedule;
Perfectionism that interferes with task completion;
Excessive conscientiousness, scrupulousness, and undue preoccupation with productivity to the exclusion of pleasure and interpersonal relationships;
Excessive pedantry and adherence to social conventions;
Rigidity and stubbornness;
Unreasonable insistence by the individual that others submit exactly to their way of doing things, or unreasonable reluctance to allow others to do things;
Intrusion of insistent and unwelcome thoughts or impulses.
5. Know some risk factors of OCPD.
OCPD is one of the most common personality disorders; the DSM-V estimates that between 2.1-7.9% of the general population suffer from OCPD. It also appears to run in families, so OCPD may have a genetic component.
Men are about twice as likely to have OCPD as women.
Children who grew up in controlling, rigid homes or environments may be more likely to develop OCPD.
Children who grew up with parents who were too stern and disapproving or overly protective may be more likely to develop OCPD.
70% of people with OCPD also suffer from depression.
About 25-50% of people with OCD also have OCPD.",OCD
222,"A girl I dated had a mild form of OCD; Anything she saw out of place on the floor such as a spot or smudge would become a topic of conversation for her. If it was red, it was most likely ketchup but she would ""obsess"" over it and ask if it was blood or something malignant. Anything stained or discolored would invite her curiosity, to the point of her concluding it was something horrible.
At smaller restaurants with grease stains, she would assume it was anything but ""grease."" It was frustrating since no amount of logic or persuasion could convince her otherwise. After awhile, my strategy would be to use reverse psychology on her such as: ""yeah, I think that's mold, and pus"" but it would just induce her paranoia. Yes, horrible I know.
There were other behaviors like the fact she felt compelled to touch a glass several times before actually picking it up. Sometimes she'd grab it, set it down, pick it up, set it down, and finally sip from it. Left unchecked I think it could get quite bad, but I believe medicine management could remedy it - she just chose to live with it. Sometimes she'd pick up the phone and call a designated friend so they could verify that what she was looking (a speck, stain, dot, or discoloration) wasn't something awful - there was no way they would know, but they'd coax her into accepting it or thinking about something else.
Another way she would cope was to play insane amounts of video games. The OCD may have helped her master games like WoW, and Sims where she became engaged and was able to ""grind"" through lots of leveling up and upgrades...something I could never muster through. Also, those games would reduce her anxiety which in turn helped reduce the OCD symptoms.
I'm sure it's frustrating to have.",OCD
223,"The main symptoms of OCD are compulsions and obsessions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that a person feels they must do in order to relief anxiety. Obsessions are intrusive, unwanted thoughts that cause anxiety.
There are a number of different symptoms that can be associated with OCD, but there are some that are more commonly seen than others. These main symptoms include:
1. obsessive thoughts – these can be about anything that the person fixates on, and can be extremely intrusive and unwanted.
2. compulsions – these are the actions that the person feels they must do in order to relieve their anxiety. These can be anything from hand-washing, to checking that doors are locked, to counting.
3. avoidance – this can be avoidance of anything that trigger the OCD thoughts or compulsions. For example, someone with OCD might avoid going outside if they are afraid of germs, or they might avoid social situations if they are afraid of being judged.
4. anxiety – this is often a constant feeling for people with OCD, as they are constantly worrying about their thoughts and whether or not they are going to act on them.
If you're struggling with OCD, know that you're not alone. There are many resources and treatments available to help you manage your symptoms and live a full life.

You switch off a light but it doesn't feel right, so you switch it on again and off again, several times until it feels right.
Any action can be like this. Cleaning the house. Parking the car. Moving an object to just the right place. Anything. You compulsively repeat actions.

I also took up other hobbies in life. I have become a skilled cook. I dealt with my obsessions with therapy but I also learned how to control them.
I had OCD bad and, most likely since my early teens but it took years to overcome it. I was unstable for close to 25 years or more. I had low self-esteem from the time I was 14 until age 48. I went through many jobs and, lots of rage for at least 35 years.

Lifestyle Changes: Stress management, mindfulness, and support groups.",OCD
227,"OCD is pretty individualistic.
I have OCD. it’s mainly obsessional thoughts but not always followed by compulsive behaviours to address the disturbingly obsessional thinking. I am not a “neat freak”. On the contrary, my obsessional thinking leads me to sit and ruminate and research while my environment sinks into squalor. Or I may be obsessing over one subject, and again will spend so much time and money seeking that thing~whether it is to obtain it, figure out how it works…it is a wide range for me personally.
I have noticed that almost all with OCD have personal hygiene rituals that can be arduous and even injurious. Not just handwashing, but bathing to excess, washing one’s face and doing laundry a lot so on.
Another struggle is the obtrusive thoughts that become obsessional thinking. An old one that’s stuck with me since childhood is are crystal-clear, gory images of myself tripping and falling face-first onto the sidewalk, smashing my front teeth and nose…the images are bloody and disturbing and so I prefer riding a bike. I have no obtrusive thoughts on a bike, absolutely no fear and therefore it’s much less stressful than walking or taking a bus, which is another nightmare of its own.
Look I could go on and on about what my OCD is like but the takeaway is, there are hundreds of “symptoms” of OCD and it’s usually not being obsessed with neatness.",OCD
228,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects people differently, but usually causes a particular pattern of thoughts and behaviours.
They may try to ignore or stop their obsessions, but that only increases their distress and anxiety.
OCD symptoms can severely affect work or school, home life, and relationships.
Symptoms of OCD can include:
Fear of embryones or contamination.
Undesirable or taboo thoughts about topics like sex, religion, or violence.
Aggressive ideas toward others or yourself.
Extreme cleaning or handwashing, specifically among women with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Ordering and arranging something in a particular, specific way.
Repeatedly checking on things, whether the door is locked or open.
Obsessive counting.
If your friend or family member may have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), try talking to them.",OCD
229,"Hi,
The symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder mainly includes having Obsession (thought or idea that preoccupies you most of the time) and Compulsion (the urge you get to do something repeatedly) that is extremely distressing. Such individuals tend to ignore personal, social and professional because most of their time is spent in engaging in compulsive behavior.
Obsessive Thoughts usually include-
Fear of getting contaminated by germs.
Fear of losing control on self.
Getting violent thoughts/ ideas of harming others.
Having unwanted and disturbing sexual thoughts
Fear of losing things or not having what you need.
The idea that everything needs to be in order (symmetry).
Having superstitions.
Compulsive Behavior mainly includes-
Spending most of the time in cleaning and washing.
Checking on loved ones repeatedly to make sure they are safe.
Repeatedly checking on locks, switches, appliances to make sure they are not going to be harmful.
Hoarding or storing things like old newspapers, food containers, etc.
Tapping, counting, repeating words or doing any activity to reduce anxiety.
Arranging stuffs in symmetry.
Engaging in rituals excessively out of religious fear.

230,"We are all different types of people, in my personal experience I did had to overcome some of my OCD ( worst of all I never realized that ” that once were part of my OCD ” ) I always knew I was kinda different ( but when people wanted to say to me ” you are this or that…. I remember answering them! Yes and I love it!!! I have to be 100% honest with all of you and let you know that growing up in a third world country and being different it wasn't easy ( even now a days any kind of mental illness, disability FOR ME ” mental gifts ” its a taboo.
I am 45 years old I live in Canada since I was 26 years old and I finally got diagnostic with OCD, ADHD, PTSD, Severe deprecion, BPD…. among others letter of the alphabet but most importantly I am ME. The only thing I was sure that I had from way before it was that I did have a learning disability, dyslexia, and stubborn.
I was told I was never going to be able to finish high school, or to have a career, forget about university or to get a job. Well for all of you reading this and have heard something like this…. I hope that you ignore them. I finished school, high school, university with the highest honors, three university degrees and landed amazing jobs, even when I came to Canada that everyone told me I was not going to be able to find a job ( cause as you can see English is not my first neither second language ) well they were mistaken too.
Going back to the question ( I do apologize for the loop ) when my first born was 6 years old he asked me mom can we go to the park and then suddenly the OCD on me start to take control and say ” nobody goes nowhere until your toys, school stuff & your room is perfect!!! Two minutes later he comes to me and say mom can I ask you 1 question? I said yes, he said mom to your standards or to normal people standards? My heart sinked and that's when I realized that although I never had a problem with my OCD whatsoever and had always been extremely upfront with whomever I was dating from day one with my habits ( I NEVER EVER REALIZE how it was afeccting, bothering, upsetting, influencing…. My kids and people that I thought it wasn't necessary for me to tell them or that they wouldn't realize. )
My Shrink have help me lots ( it wasn't easy trying to find the correct medication lucky for me I did ) in my case therapy didn't work and honestly I think unless the person doing the therapy has OCD I will be willing to try it. My OCD is not gone and I feel blessed for that what I did is trade it sounds stupid maybe but I can care less what other think about me, all my life I have been criticized no matter what something was always wrong about me. When I used to take my kids to the paediatrician it was a mental work out I just wanted to fix absolutely everything the books, toys, chairs, magazines you name it ( of course everyone will be looking at me as what is she doing. ) well I found my ways to do that without raising people attention I will start to play with my kids with one toy that was already on the floor and then put it away, on the right place, then play with other one…. Of course I wouldn't be able to finish the task of fixing the room an as a OCD that's a NO NO! but I will count how many toys stayed out of place and on the way home we will play to make words with the letters of the license plate of the cars that where ahead of us. And that's how I survived just trying my very best to keep it more to myself. Now my boys are at university and I am back to the same me and I love it. I always had at the back of my mind that I screwed up my monkeys until they come often to visit me even with friends and the oldest one one day was just touching all the surface of everything. I asked him what are you doing? He answer oh mom you have no idea how much I miss this, I say this? Yes this, this feeling of cleaning of knowing that if something falls its okay just picked up and he gave me a big hug and said to me mom never change I love you just the way you are.
There are always going to be challenged in life big, small, easy, hard, once that you might think will be impossible to achieve or get over…. The truth is that I can promise you that if you really put your mind on something most probably you are going to be able to do it. But then you have to evaluate the consequences of your choice. Are you doing it because that's what you want or because you think that's what is best for you ( and in which way ) once you know that answer. Then asked yourself is this a permanent decision ? or is a tryout ( whatever the answer to that question is *** on my experience I wouldn’t share what Is that you are planning to do until you feel that you have it under control )
We OCD people don’t enjoy to leave undone stuff and even worse if others know about it. I really hope that this have helped you. It’s hard to answer this kind of questions when you don’t know exactly what are your biggest trades of OCD.
Wish you the very best

231,"Overcome it as in never have it rear its ugly face again in your life, the way you can overcome a cold?
No, not at all.
You are not your thoughts or your anxieties. When you understand this and start to believe it, then if horrible thoughts come up, they won't matter, because the momentum behind them has been deflated. If an OCD thought or compulsion comes up and there is a spike of anxiety, who cares? Flinches and reflexes are normal in the body, so why not the mind?
If you do relapse a bit and go to make sure the door was locked, well, you checked. Can't change the past now. It doesn't mean you are relapsing, it just means you have some scar tissue. Most survivors do.
Overcoming it means being at peace with what is in you. It doesn't mean obliterating it out existence.

It is debilitating, intrusive and can interfere in the normal functioning of a person.

235,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

236,"To be honest. I did it with shear will-power it wasn’t easy at all. I just told myself that i need to accept it every morning until one day it was completely gone without me knowing. Then i actually remember it’s been quite a well since i had any intrusion thoughts. it took me about 2 months to accept it and till this day i’m perfectly fine.
It’s different for everyone and not something i’d wish upon anyone. My mind was working overtime 24/7. But i’m glad that will power actually worked, because i didnt want medication.

No need to stop negative thoughts.

And why you need to stop negative thoughts?!!!!!
“Negative thoughts cannot do anything to your life. “
Negative thoughts are not facts.
So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Just focus on taking positive actions only.”
Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.

238,"It’s very unlikely. I guess anything is possible, but OCD is, for some people, a severe and disabling condition. It’s not a character flaw or a bad habit that can just be overcome by sheer willpower. I suppose to some extent, everyone can (or at least should be able to) control their behaviors. So if anything, you may be able to reduce or stop yourself from performing some compulsions, since those are generally (but not always) actions/behaviors. I don’t think you can control your obsessions because those are thoughts. If thoughts were easy to ignore or stop, then there would be no need to psychologists or psychiatrists, right?
Also, if you are able to stop your compulsions, which might be behaviors or actions, what might end up happening is that you develop mental compulsions. Since those are thoughts, no one but you would know that you are doing them. So to onlookers, you might appear better, but you might actually be worse - more consumed by unwanted thoughts and mental rituals.
Also, my understanding is that the more you try to push away unwanted thoughts, the more they occur. Therapists have always told me when OCD thoughts are really bad, don’t try to argue with the thoughts. Don’t try to push them away. It just won’t work. The better option is distraction, but not actively fighting the thoughts. Let the thoughts be there, just don’t focus on them. But don’t ignore them. It’s hard for sure. So I guess I don’t know how you’d even propose overcoming OCD with ‘force of will’. If that means arguing or fighting with the thoughts, I’d have to say no, that won’t work. If it means distracting, not giving into the compulsions, noticing the thoughts, but not focusing on them…then maybe.",OCD
239,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
240,"While I am not a psychologist I can tell you my personal opinion and experience says yes. Being Buddhist we speak much about this. I think if you read a bit about Buddhism, specifically Tibetan Buddhism you will find that this is a root belief. One can go further in says it is not only a belief or theory but fact. I will not attempt to argue that but I will try to explain it.
At my Temple we have had Many doctors attend on various occasions. They are more open minded to Buddhist philosophy than in the past.
In Buddhism we have 31 planes of existence. The Thirty-one Planes of Existence
There are Hellish realms, ghostly realms, animal realms, our realm known as the plane of desire, and higher realms as well.
The realm in which we reside, is the 5th of 31. The goal or belief is to avoid rebirth which would have us return to this realm. Rebirth is not the same as reincarnation. It is also possible that we descend into a lower realm due to anger, aggression, desire or other bad thoughts and practices.
If you think about it, in our everyday life desire has a lot to do with all that runs society Globally. I generally say Psychology is the most powerful agent in society.
It is most often about what we want. What we seek. We desire, pleasure, calm, and being content and happy.
Companies use advertisements to try to persuade you to purchase their products, they use psychology in doing so. Just as someone running for a position of power desires your vote, they use psychology to try and earn your vote. This is all based on desire.
There are many other examples, but if you look around we always desire. It is hard to avoid. What can happen with OCD is one becomes obsessive in what they can not have. Be it a situation, a feeling, an object or anything else. Desire feeds desire. This is a feedback loop and a cycle that is difficult to break. Suffering and desire generally go hand in hand.
From a Buddhist perspective this is one of the more difficult challenges we often face. This is why we practice meditation. There are many forms of meditation. The one that has the most benefit is the empty mind. Concentration on nothing, clearing all thoughts and purging our subconscious of these thoughts has a lasting effect.
These are techniques used by some psychologist, generally as part of CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
It does work however as with anything it requires effort. So often now we want to take a pill and change the chemistry of our brain to solve a mind issue. In some cases that may be the only solution so I never disagree with that. It is however important to try to resolve issues with other approaches that do not require medication or a combination of both.
From a Christian perspective, yes it there is also a spiritual component as well. There are many verses that speak of different desire and obsession in the Bible. I lean a bit more toward the Catholic perspective on this ( while today that may seem like a contradiction in terms. LOL).
Any good Priest would speak to great length about this topic as it is one that is embedded in just about every religion.
Is a spiritual approach the correct approach? Well not for everyone. It really depends on the person. From a Buddhist perspective we believe to live is to suffer, we want to avoid that, but we must accept it.
I would not try to push a spiritual solution upon anyone that is not spiritual, it will not work. The person has to be open minded and willing to accept this into their therapy.

I think in the end the answer to your question is it depends. It depends on the person. Each Religion or Philosophy will say yes in almost every case. That however does not mean that each and every person will accept that. Is that wrong? No, An atheist would say , your crazy just go to a good psychiatrist and try the medication he prescribes. And , that has worked fine for some.
I do believe it is important to find yourself and understand what you believe and have faith in. That can be an important cornerstone to the success of any treatment be it for addiction, behavioral issues or just life in general.
I hope that helps, that is just my thoughts for what they are worth.",OCD
241,"I got possessed by some unseen supernatural powers when I was young. Hailing from a decent family, everyone including myself thought it to be a psychiatric issue and sought help from my uncle who was a neurosurgeon. Even after 6 months of meds, my condition never improved. I felt drugged all the time due to severe side effects of the psychiatric meds I had been prescribed. Belonging to a hindu family, I was taken to a saint who was a Krishnaa devotee. He treated me with holy water , asked me to chant Lord Hanuman's name (god's name) in meditation. Though it took 5-6 months , but finally I got treated.
As pointed out by the saint, the reasons for possession are->1) Not being chaste/ celibate
2) Eating meat & non-veg food, which are the foods of ghosts/ jinns/ bad spirits
3) Not meditating on God's name, which is the biggest deterrent against possession and invisible powers
[One can chant any God's name of his/her religion/faith, but should be done in meditation with eyes closed to see instant effect. The longer one does it, the more benefit one will see(min 15 minutes a day). Also strict physical celibacy is needed; else meditation on God won't show results]
The Mental disorders that I got rid of after following the above rules->
1) Heavy head
2) Sleeplessness/ severe insomnia- I could not sleep for 8-10 months in a row & no meds could make me fall asleep either
3) Vivid nightmares , which occurred every time I tried to sleep. [Bad supernatural powers cause bad dreams, like falling from cliff, you/ family members getting killed]

THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS MOSTLY CAUSE MENTAL DISORDERS , WHICH RESEMBLE A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. SO ITS DIFFICULT TO DETECT.
According to the saint, jinns/spirits are in the form of air in this world & are invisible to humans on an average spiritual level . (But once a person comes on a very high spiritual level through strict 'celibacy' & meditation on God over lifetime, he/she attains spiritual powers to see these evil creatures) . Also, these jinns/spirits can attack only the people at low/average spiritual level (ie, who are not chaste/ don't meditate on God's names), that means, they can attack almost everyone on earth, as most of us don't lead a spiritual life. They attach themselves to the person's nervous system as well as circulatory system. They tend to play with the two organs- brain & heart.
The reason for attachment is to get Pleasure out of your body. So, to get pleasure , these powers first enter your physical body via air & once inside the lungs, move into circulatory system and attach themselves to heart, brain, spinal cord etc. Once attached to your body, they get the pleasure that you're getting through food etc (So celibacy is a strict criteria as these creatures like sex pleasures through one's body).
Possession varies ( the % of body getting possessed), & thus can be classified into partial possession and complete possession. Partial possession if not controlled through strict celibacy & meditation will surely move to a full possession in which the possessed person will lose entire control over his body & mind.
Also possession never starts from full directly; it always progress from slight to partial to complete. However , if one reached to a complete possession state, the jinn/spirit has complete command over your body & can do/say anything through your body. In that case, the victim's claims of seeing other beings, creatures, etc. is not what the victim sees, but what actually the spirit sees
After going through the possession, I now believe in both science and spirituality. It has made me much stronger. I also cracked CAT in my first attempt & converted 3 of the IIMs (prestigious MBA college in India).
Also , I've extensively written this article so that anyone who faces any such issue , easily identifies the same & applies the above remedies to his/her benefit. :) :)",OCD
242,"Yes, when you are trying to direct your life from fear, you become compulsive, etc. It is acting out from the lack of accepting “ Thy Will Be Done.” I can not play God, or protect me, I have to surrender to the love of the universe for my needs to be met and I can rest in the presence of love. give up your fears, resentments, and anger to allow your heart to open and fill you with love and direct your way.
In the last few days, I found out more about my OCD which caused me a big concern. I found it comes from me from trying to be perfect as I always felt I was less then others. If I am perfect maybe I would be loved and liked.
This is also called pride or wearing a mask to look good to others when inside I am totally distraught trying to be part of life. I had to get honest with myself and release the pride which is a false cover and drop the mask to look good and feel that I am good enough to others. My actions did not support the real me that always has been good enough in God’s eyes and love me with all my short comings.",OCD
243,"Does OCD (Obsessive Compulsive disorder) have a spiritual dimension?
I would say so, yes — if you are willing to see it in this way.
OCD is experienced as a lack of autonomy, helplessness, the feeling of having no choice or power, the feeling of being forced — compulsion.
“I feel like I just have to do these things, even if I don’t want to.”
“If I don’t keep re-locking the door, it just doesn’t feel safe.”
It is also experienced as doubt.
“Did I lock that window? … I did, but it doesn’t feel locked, let me lock it again.”
“Are my hands clean? I just washed them, but they don’t feel clean. Are they really clean? Let me wash them again.”
The experience of autonomy—or not—and the experience of doubt, clearly have a spiritual dimension, no?
Who has not wrestled with the question of whether or not we have choice or free will, the degree to which our behavior is determined?
Who has not wrestled with doubt in God or in spiritual realities, in general?
The particular emotional syndrome, of which OCD is an exaggerated manifestation, is very similar to what one experiences during a spiritual crisis. However the “spiritual version” of OCD, if I can talk about it that way, is less robotic, more refined, more heady/hearty as opposed to the behavioral syndrome that is OCD.
Look at an insect, perfectly programmed like an OCD victim. Whatever its program tells it to do, it does. I am hard pressed to believe that insects have any experience of autonomy.
Look at a human—filled to the brim with the experience of autonomy (whether or not they have it, absolutely). Yet frequently finding that in practice, their habits and programming make them feel almost robotic.
Do we have autonomy, or not?
Is there a God? And if so, do I have any choice?
Is it All God? And if so, is my choice an illusion?
Are we forced, or is there true Freedom?
These are potent spiritual questions.
May all sufferers of OCD feel these powerful questions in their heart and make maximal value of their affliction!",OCD
244,"alright. i’ve seen and interacted with some pretty crazy shit in my time but don’t ever, EVER tell someone with a mental disorder, especially one like OCD or schizophrenia, that they’re possessed by a demon. this can cause people serious harm. you can, privately, believe whatever you like. but don’t tell them there’s something evil inside of them and don’t try to get it out because it won’t work.
and when it doesn’t work, they’ll believe they’re what’s evil, and they may end up thinking they’re the one that’s got to go. don’t do this! ever!",OCD
245,No . Dimensions are something a different topic to talk though. OCD is just a error in the filter in your brain which filters out intrusive thoughts. For me it's not even illness it's just a behaviour pattern for some individuals . Btw it hurts too much . It tortures me daily but i will conquer it .,OCD
246,"My personal belief is that the capacity of one's Own parameters are still paranormal when it comes to their own thought process. Numerous Studies have been conducted based on synaptic and coding. Your brain is consistently electrically firing in different wavelengths which are specifically timed to your specific dimensional output. So to speak. In other words there is an order or let's say a firing order to your brain. Those firing orders are designed to keep you as an individual functioning at a specific radius and output of your own oddity. So, for instance Tourette Syndrome - which is a misguiding Alliance of One's Own firing order. The brain is not functioning correctly. It's due to traumatic injuries, head injuries, potential barricades in one of many protein synthetic barriers of a brain injury which healed wrong. Now you have a firing order which is in fact hitting a wall and bouncing off that wall into something else- which is causing motor function to reconstrue itself in a forwarding motion.

247,"Yes it definitely is. How do I discern this?
Have you witnessed the evil eye? I have. During occasions, the narcissist in your life will have lizard like eyes for a split moment. I witnessed this during the raging episodes. It is very scary stuff. I am not the only victim who has noticed this.
Where do all narcissists learn the many tools in their tool box? I was hit before the internet happened. And the narcissist was never an avid reader either.
Covertness, deception and manipulation. This is how the dark world always operates.
The prince of darkness is all about killing, stealing and destroying. He even gaslighted Eve in the garden of Eden.
Speak to a victim who suffered immensely and listen to what he/she thinks. I am beyond convinced as to where the source of the hit came from.
Ultimately, it is a question of faith. I know the prince of darkness hates me in a unique way. To heal I needed the power of God as I was beyond hopeless. And I learnt a very precious lesson. God is the top priority of my life and this is how it will always be.",OCD
248,"Yes. In the specific sense that a lot of the afflicted have religious obsessions. Moreover, it's the doubter's disease. Basically, your brain is stuck in a perpetual ""what if?"" mode.",OCD
249,"Howdy Sean,
I’m not sure if anyone is following this anymore. But I feel that I might be able to help as I have suffered with OCD for many years and have made significant progress in the last 6 months.
I have read so many articles and watched countless videos on the topic of enlightenment as well as other psychology and spiritual material trying to find answers, which in some ways has contributed to the sufffering that I have gone through because there are a lot of different points of views and beliefs etc.
Having said that, I cannot comment on enlightentment and if you will achieve it or if I will, because I haven’t experienced it yet. But from what I have read and viewed, they do say that enlightenment is total dis identification with thought. Not meaning that you no longer have thoughts, you’re just no longer effected by them in a suffering way.
I, myself have found something that really does work, as Jon mentioned above, and that is awareness and where you place your attention.
I have found that every thought that I have automatically grabs my attention because for so many years, being identified with thinking, every thought has been important. They’re not, trust me on that. So basically what I do is when I become aware of a thought coming up, I accept that it is there, and divert my attention to the feeling of my breathing in my nostrils. If there is any feeling (emotions or slight pain) in my body, I allow them to be there without resisting them or judging them in any way at all.
The thing is, whatever you resist, will persist. So if you have a thought process that you don’t like, and you think, I don’t want this, or why am I experiencing these thoughts. They will continue, because you are feeding them more energy by thinking about them. But if you acknowledge that they have come up, don’t judge them and see them as only a thought and gently divert your attention to your breathing, they eventually get the picture that there is no need for them to be there. I have released a lot of thought process that I use to have that use to control me.
I will be honest with you, some days are harder than others because as I said earlier, thoughts have a way of being seductive and pulling your attention in, but if you remind yourself to divert your attention back to the breathing, then you’re doing amazing each time and making progress to dis identifying with your thoughts.
I also believe that most of our thought patterns, we have learnt from everyone else and can be unlearnt as well. because at one point in our lives, we weren’t thinking some of the horrible shit that we think now. but those people we learnt how to think from, they done the same thing from others that they trusted and it goes on and on and on. No-one is at fault. it is all unconscious learning of useless beliefs, opinions and views of the way things are or how they should be, when in reality, everything is as it is. Simple
Anyway, I hope this helps somewhat :)",OCD
250,"OCD means you have fear of thoughts.
To overcome 100% , just understand below things and BOOM, you are free from OCD
No need to stop the negative thoughts.
The more you want to stop it, the more they will come.
“Negative thoughts cannot do anything to your life“ , Believe me.
So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Thoughts cannot do anything.”
Just focus on taking positive actions only.
Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.
So focus on taking positive actions only.",OCD
251,"First calm yourself!
See ocd is a mental disorder in which we find things to be perfect and any thought that realizes us that it gonna harm in future or it is not the right way to do things you can do better etc will create anxiety. There are some measures you can do to relax yourself while ocd in long term.
When a thought come to you that you have done this thing wrong or you haven't check it right go and check again then don't go for any compulsions just stay and think what happened if I will not do it can actually something happen . Think consciously and leave the rest. I know there is some anxiety happens here but don't worry next time you will feel less anxiety about it.
Don't do compulsions in repetitive manner just distract your mind in other things
Try cognitive behavioral therapy
Accept that you can't do things perfectly and if something remain disturbed then leave it don't manage them.
Accept that you have ocd and when any compulsive thought come across your mind revise your mind that it is ocd thought and the mind is lying to you.
Studies shows that ocd thoughts are almost 100 % false they are not exist in this real world. And what you are thinking is not going to happen ever.
Never feel lonely this beautiful world ,nature ,universe is with you.
Connect with nature and make yourself busy in positive and creative things that you enjoy.
Talk to friends and family members.
You have alot of potential and strength and you can live your best life so go for it!
Best wishes !!",OCD
252,"See more than Psychotherapies healthy lifestyle work more effectively to manage any psychological disorder problems ..
Yes when problem get severe individual is not in state to understand importance of healthy lifestyle etc…. So at this time family’s support , care , nutritious food , medication and other things help to manage with such problem ..
Start running in morning but before running do 20 mins of walking ..
Do yoga exercises in morning ..
Fix your meal time and consistently follow it..
Have nutritious food only okay.. totally avoid junk food , oily food , and other foods which do not give energy but deteriorate health ..
Sit with nature for sometime .. do something for nature in return u will also get something..
Stop thinking too much on any topic or on any thing..
make less use of mobile , internet.. these are poison for humans..
Try to enjoy life whatever health issues u have (yes this is my personal experience ) automatically u will forget your pains.. and feel good .. Thanks.. 🙏🔆❇️🍁🤼‍♂️⛹️‍♂️⛹️‍♀️👌🚴🏋‍♂️🔱🍄🌿🔅💃🚴🏋‍♂️🏋‍♂️🏋‍♂️🔆❇️🍁🤼‍♂️⛹️‍♀️👌🔅🌿🍄💃💃",OCD
253,"Try to learn what you can about ERP, and then try to implement some of the things they say to do.
reach out to people who are close to you in order to receive extra support.
lastly, look into medication. Zoloft is very effective and I have also heard that inositol can be effective as well.
wishing you or your family the best.
you can overcome it, even though it can be a very debilitating mental disorder.
always try to remember- the thoughts are not you. Everyone has ‘weird/crazy’ thoughts, but people who don’t have ocd just let them go by so they don’t become obsessions.
what finally got me past my obsessions was a Bible verse- “do not be anxious over anything….but in everything by prayer and supplication let your petitions be made known to God, and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” - Phillipians 4:6,7 (NWT)
and that’s coming from someone who had ‘religious’ ‘scrupulousity’ ocd. So I had to let my worst nightmare fears come and go - without asking for forgiveness. It felt like the most difficult thing to do.
but they say that ocd is so evil because you develop obsessions/compulsions about the things you care about the most in life.
so that was comforting to hear. It helped me to see that I wouldn’t obsess over the random thought of ‘I think cows are ugly’ because cows are not important to me. But if I had a negative thought about religious/spiritual things, it was devastating to me.
thankfully, my congregation elders understood and helped me to realize it was not my fault. I also read material that helped me to see that God doesn’t fault us for things like that out of our control.
anyway, I’m rambling, but I gave my experience to show that anything is possible.",OCD
254,"There wasn’t a lot that could help that wasn’t ultimately counter-productive during the worst years of OCD for me. I would chant under my breath and compulsively wash and enter in and out of rooms. Sometimes I’d listen to music and try to meditate away everything.
What actually ended up working was a guided practice from a cognitive behavioral therapist who told me to willfully focus on the thoughts that gave me the most difficulty or anxiety, rather than forcefully push them out.
Bringing the thoughts into the forefront of my mind’s eye and keeping them there eventually lead to my most stubborn triggers and fears losing their potency. It took a few months of regular practice, but this exercise worked to quell the worst symptoms of OCD for me.",OCD
255,"I suffered from OCD for four years of my life. But, now it’s quite hard to believe that as I don’t have it anymore in my life. I can remember my OCD symtomps as ealry as when I was 13 or 14 years old. It wastes a lot of your time and suck up most of your energy. The anxiety, the intense urge to perform certain action in a certain way - it was bad. But, I have never been to a psychologist for a diagnosis or took meds. For a long time I didn’t even know what it actually is.
What helped me is - awareness and full knowledge about my condition. I can’t count how many web pages I visited to understand OCD. I stuffed my mind with coping strategies and OCD related information - this is the most important part - so everytime I performed my rituals my mind would interrupt and say, Dude! What the hell are you doing?
I understood my obsessions and compulsions and observed them. Sometimes it’s quite funny what absense or inadquacey of certain chemical do to our behaviour. However, it takes time. I came to know about my OCD 5 years ago and I am completely normal from last one year or so. RIght now I am 20 and I have already started to forgot what OCD feel like.
Self help is the best way to treat yourself if your symtomps are not severe. List your obsessions and observe your compulsions and if possible, laugh at them. You can find a tonn of stuff on Internet that can help you learn to cope with your obsessions and compulsions. Be consistent while improving yourself and never give up. It will take quite a lot time but one day OCD will be out of your life.
Hope this helps.",OCD
256,"For me personally, I find it so much easier talking to my OCD and personifying it really. I will tell it to shut up or say yeah whatever just little things like that it helps me to detach the intrusive thoughts from my morals and who i really am i see OCD as a bully it's sort of like im saying ""im not listening to you now"" i used to be so much more afraid that thats who i was and another thing that really does help i know how extremely hard it is but exposure therapy. For example I would tell myself ""There are a million switches on in the world right now and nothing bad is happening"" and i was able to just walk past it however being in a room with the switch is a lor harder. You have to build up to things for example if you cant do odd numbers have the volume on an odd number for ten seconds, then maybe later on or tomorrow have it for 20 seconds and just work towards that goal. With OCD your anxiety is sky high and doing your compulsions/rituals makes the anxiety drop rapidly rather than it coming down slowly on its own naturally. When you know you can do something to immediately ease your anxiety its a lot easier to do that than to be uncomfortable for a little bit. It just takes practice and willpower.",OCD
257,"If some one has to manage his health problems he has to be disciplined first by following healthy lifestyle..
If someone has to prevent diseases he has to take precautions, he has to be aware of health problems and it's symptoms, he has to live healthy lifestyle..
And if he has to face and fight against difficult situations than again it's good that he start living healthy life style and make his weakness his mental strength..
So many times I write about healthy lifestyle and other therapies and other positive things and i think u might also be knowing about them because we collect experience s and see example s that takes place around us and we learn from them..

258,I am not a doctor and I don’t truly haveOCD but have some behaviors that are OCD like but don’t cause me difficulty. Those behaviors support beliefs I innocently created in early childhood to understand my experiences. The behavior I chose support those beliefs to keep them going even if they are inaccurate and they keep me from the pain of those early childhood experiences. So if I was punished for something when I was 3 when it was a simple childhood accident I will be afraid of punishment if I make a mistake and I will behave with OCD like behaviors like checking 10 times if a door is locked and being perfect so I won’t be punished. I used the same process and cured my depression after 30 years of suicidal thoughts . I do not get depressed or do my OCD behaviors and have been off meds for over 25 years. I had to identify my beliefs and trail them back to the experience where I created them but not relive the experience then clear the beliefs.,OCD
259,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on helping the individual identify and challenge their distorted thoughts and beliefs that lead to obsessive-compulsive behavior.
2. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP): ERP is a form of CBT that focuses on gradually exposing the individual to their triggers and then teaching them how to manage their responses.
3. Medication: Medication can be effective in managing the symptoms of OCD. Commonly prescribed medications include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
4. Relaxation Techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation can help reduce anxiety and stress associated with OCD.
5. Self-Help Strategies: Self-help strategies such as keeping a daily journal, making a list of compulsions and their triggers, and setting realistic goals can help individuals manage their symptoms.

262,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health disorder that affects the brain in several ways. It is characterized by intrusive and persistent thoughts, feelings, and urges (obsessions) that lead to repetitive behaviors (compulsions). People with OCD often experience intense anxiety and fear related to their obsessions.
The exact cause of OCD is unknown, but research suggests that it is related to changes in the brain’s chemical and structural makeup. It is thought that the neurotransmitter serotonin plays a role in OCD. People with OCD have been found to have lower levels of serotonin in the brain, which can lead to an imbalance in the brain’s communication pathways. This can cause obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.
Brain imaging studies have also shown that people with OCD have increased activity in certain parts of the brain, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus. These areas are associated with decision-making, emotion regulation, and problem-solving. This increased activity is thought to contribute to the obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors experienced by people with OCD.
If you’re curious to learn more about how obsessive-compulsive disorder affects the brain, check out the link in the bio for an in-depth exploration.",OCD
263,"The inability to make decisions is a consequence of adolescent development, so the brain is about 90 % plus complete at age 6, but function really doesn't have much to go on because functioning is determined by a combinstion of reason and long term memories maintained by the brain, the more complex memories are the better the reasoning, and reason mainly comes from the front of the brain and emotions come from both the back and deep within the brain.
Connections between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex store emotional references pertaining to memories generated by connections within and without the limbic system which really is all over the place.
As children grow their grey matter is withered away and replaced by the connections taken up by white matter which is a network of reinforced neuronal tentacles insulated by gala along the route, so that is how cognitive developments take place in the brain, if there is no work done by the brain there is no memories initiated and no cognitive development but the grey matter withers away regardless, the brain doesn't shrink, the white matter still grows but it doesn't connect with other parts of the brain’s limbic system particularly the amygdala so not much is represented by the neural pathways.
Obscessive-compulsive disorder is just one expression of this disconnect of neural pathways connecting memories to imediate reasoning functionality, it's the inability to decide that causes indecisive actions, an emotional searching for a feeling of satisfaction, and its interesting to note that its the same emotional response that causes intelligence, because both obsessive-compulsive functioning and learning are derived from the same motivational source, maybe cognitive development is just controlling obsessions with enforced decision based judgments.",OCD
264,"First of all…your brain has an interpretation of what goos around you , as pict up bye the censes with his connotations and as perceived for being good ore bad. And that’s one thing… but , it also is counting into reality that time is real and time has future and past with in between what we call present. It’s like a system of a computer, zero and one…good and bad.
So then…. Obsessive compulsive behaviour is the belief that the individual has that if he acts in a certain way in the present, he will avoid bad outcomes in the future. The brain is affected in a way that the stimulus creates a certain pattern , the stimulus is a certain behaviour and the pattern is repetitive activity where the individual connected positive feedback and reflexion from past positive experiences.
The path to getting “ rid “ from this behaviour is the letting go of the notion time .. , tomorrow never comes. The actions of today isn’t necessarily giving a certain outcome tomorrow because the future isn’t a static fixed “ thing “ , it’s a changing whirlpool of events that don’t have certain outcomes and what is right today isn’t necessarily right tomorrow because change is always going around.
living life in the moment is just responding too “ wat is” in a none pre meditated way but actually from a base of confidence and none judging. The choice between good and bad is the main hindrance to living your full potential. You will always be doing something good and likewise something bad, that called making mistakes and that’s normal living. The avoidance of making mistakes in the present time too have a good outcome tomorrow is actually ruining your today’s reality. The mistake is trying not to make mistakes, because what is good and bad goos hand in hand. Like front needs back and up needs down, you need bad too have good. Wanting to avoid bad is …creating bad even more. Plunge into it, keep it company…that’s the way to get rid off it.",OCD
265,"Interesting question,
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been shown to diminishes the volume amount of grey matter within the brain, resulting in people with OCD to be less able to control their impulses.
The low levels of grey matter can also contribute to changes in the a person processes information, which can directly contribute to that person being more likely to obsess over “bad thoughts” whether they intend to or not.
Combined Imaging, surgical, and lesion studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex (orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortexes), basal ganglia, and thalamus are involved in the pathogenesis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
As those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have less grey matter in the specific regions of the brain, those same regions are important as they essentially act to “suppress responses as well as bad habits.
Subsequent Brain scans are be able to reveal which people can be at genetic risk of developing obsessive compulsive disorder.",OCD
266,"Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD) is an anxiety disorder where some people have unwanted, recurring thoughts, ideas, or sensations ( obsession) that makes them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsion)
These compulsive acts if not performed, causes a great amount of distress. For instance, an individual will feel the need to have only 3 teaspoons of sugar with their morning coffee, with three different spoons. They need to open-and-shut the door or the light switches a certain number of times before they leave or come back home, or else they feel that something bad might happen to someone they know or the world.
These thoughts, behaviors, and actions are a result of certain cognitive deficits.
When you see a kitchen counter dirty, your brain gives a signal to clean it up. People with OCD get these signals repeatedly.
Some cognitive deficits associated with basic learning processes, executive functioning, attention, and decision making are a result due to communication error in some parts of the brain like orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, etc., And abnormalities in the neurotransmitter levels. These lead to cognitive deficits.
Everyone experiences intrusive thoughts but people with OCD misinterpret these thoughts and take them to have personal significance, with catastrophic consequences.
Some common deficits in the cognition are:
Inflated sense of responsibility where the person believes that if they follow the compulsions, they can save others from some catastrophic consequences.
Control of thoughts where they believe that it's necessary and possible to control their thoughts.
Overestimation of danger where they believe that danger is possible and will lead to bad.
Perfectionism where they believe that one simply can't make mistakes.
Over importance of a thought where they believe that thinking about a negative event might increase the possibility of it's occurrence.
These cognitive dysfunctions lead to huge amounts of distress in day-to-day functioning and a normal day routine too becomes an ordeal.
Thus a person is not able to function properly and cognitive functions are hard to perform.",OCD
267,"I don’t know if I’d call it a “defect”, exactly, but brain scans of people with OCD are different than those of people without it - the prefrontal cortex of the brain is overactive in people with OCD. It also appears to be related to an imbalance in the levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, with serotonin levels being abnormally low and dopamine levels, abnormally high. Certainly, though, the OCD brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, uses far more energy than the non-OCD brain.",OCD
268,"OCD is a truly painful condition and I am sorry for anyone who has to endure it. I first started experiencing symptoms when I turned twelve. Since my intrusive thoughts are religious in nature, my condition went undiagnosed until I turned sixteen.
I honestly thought that I had lost touch with reality; I remember feeling like everywhere I went these thoughts would follow me. I felt that I could not really explain my problem to anyone because they would not understand it, and when I tried to…they didn’t.
Finally, when I found out that OCD can be of a moral/scrupulous nature, I was able to understand what was happening to me. My parents took me to a Psychologist and I received an official diagnosis.
After I learned that my thoughts were the result of a mental condition and were not going to go away, I remember feeling extremely depressed. I thought that I would always grapple with this issue and had been handed a mental millstone to carry around.
Then, I started going to therapy. My therapist utilized exposure-response prevention and helped me to rewire my brain. Even though I had known before that my thoughts were irrational, I felt like my brain was finally starting to understand that too. I started to notice that the “volume” of my thoughts became lower and I was able to function better. I had an easier time sleeping and eating, and I felt like I could enjoy being around my friends.
There are many people who suffer from anxiety conditions, which I am sure you know. “Normal” anymore is subjective and most people aren’t. I am just one person and my experience may not be yours, but I can say that my quality of life has significantly improved since getting professional help.
I still have thoughts that bother me, but have experienced significant relief from my symptoms. Some are able to achieve complete remission.
In short, a good life is possible despite having OCD.",OCD
269,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

272,"Absolutely. Not to be confused with the OCPD which is more a learned behavior. Children born with an enlarged amygdala show this type of OCD, with rituals and checking patterns. It can be managed with medication and psychotherapy. It’s also known to run through genetics, noticeably. The personality disorder is not diagnosed until age of 18 or more. Children can and do have OCD.",OCD
273,"I am one of those who had this since childhood. And I have observed many other children having a sign of it.
But its although a disorder, honestly I never had any issues living with it.",OCD
274,"OCD reduces gray matter in certain areas of the brain, most notably parts of the frontal lobe. This impairs impulse control and the processing of information in people with OCD, and is partly why people with OCD tend to obsess over intrusive thoughts, and find it hard not to perform compulsions. The brains of people with OCD are also often serotonin-deficient, causing increased anxiety, and the OCD brain shows increased activity in some areas as opposed to the “normal"" brain.
Having said all this, there doesn't seem to be any evidence that OCD “stops the brain from developing”. Our brains just develop and operate differently than those of people without the disorder.",OCD
275,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
276,"Although children have the disadvantage of not being aware that there is a problem, if untreated, the disorder causes adults to suffer more. I would say that it is much harder on them because they have to hold down a job (and might have had to study to get their degree), and may have a family to support, etc. In order to function, adults with OCD must constantly monitor their own actions, and struggle to distinguish between what is reasonable and what is irrational. (This, of course, would be easier if the OCD is under control, as a result of psychotherapy and/or prescription meds.) Also, it could be very challenging to make sure that their own behavioural patterns do not ""rub off"" on their children. They must ensure that they do their very best to control their obsessive-compulsive behaviour when around them, because children tend to mimic their parents. It might be very difficult not to instil in them their own oppressive thoughts, and they must know where to draw the line between being clean and tidy and letting compulsions rule over the lives of children, who should be enjoying life, as opposed to being enslaved to thoughts and actions that impact their happiness.",OCD
277,"It is necessary to know what OCD that is bothering you? Is it food or a particular behavior or set of conditions or what. Some common types of OCD’s:
worrying too much about someone’s illness, fetish of cleanliness, pangs of childlessness, fears of safety, afraid of committing mistakes, unwanted intrusive thoughts, compulsiveness, certain situations and many more. But you get the drift.
The brain is the seat of any OCD and it manifests in the subject's behavior. Living with this behavior, which may appear and take hold of the person for long periods or many short duration of this compulsive behavior that causes severe anxiety and interferes with your daily life in many ways. It is like an audio tape that is stuck at one point and whenever that point explodes in your face your brain is bombarded with a set of thoughts, images, speech patterns and personas in certain cases lessons which play in your mind at that moment. The moment can be short or long but it more often a cause of embarrassment. This embarrassment is known to you and only those who are aware of your OCD. This results in anxiety which overrides your brain’s alarm.
At moments you know that your anxieties are really not real and it makes no sense but for you it is very real. is your brain lying to you? Is your brain deceiving you? If your brain is lying then chances are that you have OCD. Further, your (sanity) warning system is not working. Obsessions are behaviors in the form of thoughts, images and impulses that are outside your control. Today brain scans can surface (showing imagery of different parts of the brain) that can establish presence of OCD’s.
But it is also a fact that OCD people do not want these obsessions that triggers anxieties. They are disturbing to the OCD person because he/she does not want it. They (the OCD people) find it discomforting and disturbing because they do not make any sense. Take the case of the OCD (things must be done in a certain way and that is the only way and hence the right way). If things are not done that way they arouse fear, disgust and doubt in people. The “Right Way” is more often than not notional. To stake a lot on this is an OCD. A normal/non OCD person will say it but not put a stake in the ground. Another time, another place and get along with life. Being Right for an OCD person takes a heavy mental health toll and living in that belief adds to psychological disorders and obsessive personality distractions.
It is also a fact that everyone has some OCD’s but not strong or disturbing ones that can lead to personality damages. Most people know when they exhibit one and quickly observe it and get over it and move on. But, if you feel you are much too obsessed and your insistence of your “Right Way” is damaging your mental health you need to be counseled by an expert who can conclusively establish you have OCD. Cure or its management is the next part.
Since OCD is something to do with the brain or if you like a grander word “mind”. you need to work towards getting to control your brain and mind. (I use the words interchangeably, though in the strictest sense they are not). In my experience and general observations on life the best way to get control over your mind is by the practice of meditation. There are many ways to meditate. Talk with someone knowledgeable and find important forms/ways of meditation. Try and i am sure you will find that meditation that suits you most. You can try Vipasana. i have wonderful outcomes.
whether your OCD will interfere with your married life? Think about your OCD, maybe try meditating for a couple of weeks. instinctively I can say with pretty good confidence that your OCD is more damaging in your imagination than it actually is. If it was not so you would not be seeking an answer here.
good Luck. Cheers",OCD

280,"I can talk about myself and that might give you some insight about OCD.
I first experienced a very mild form of OCD when I was around 16 and that was due to academic pressure at school and by the hullabaloo about the colleges I should get in after I graduate from school.
By the time I reached 19, I gained some obsessions and compulsions — still I didn't realise just yet I might have had developed OCD and took it — as something that everyone around my age experiences.
At around 20— after many nervous episodes due to OCD — when my compulsions started hindering my life — I recognised my OCD and started working towards mitigating and controlling it with proven methods and mental restraint.
Now at 21 — after researching significantly and extensively on mental health — fought my way through a very mentally infuriating time due to OCD — I came about two conclusions about how OCD is developed.
One, the genetic inheritance — I realised it late but observing my dad and grandma’s actions and some memories from my childhood — I realised that they are also in a way suffering from OCD — my dad’s paranoia when a certain compulsion of his is not fulfilled and my grandma’s sudden anxiety attacks due to overthinking fell in the range of obsessions and compulsions. I believe that the OCD that I had cultivated is in some or the other way is inherited through genetics.
Second, the environment around you plays an important role as well. In my case — I had the genes that by getting triggered by outside factors resulted in OCD — that took me by surprise. The pressure of being in an engineering college was daunting and thus my mind began to cultivate notions, obsessions and compulsions — assuring me if I will follow a certain routine — I would be able to survive college.
There are genes and there are many outside factors that our brain perceives as dangerous which helps trigger OCD.",OCD
281,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
282,"I have contamination ocd, religious ocd.
In contamination ocd, you will do one task multiple times, like you will wash your hands, you will clean the desk, you will wash your clothes multiple times, you will start doubting on simple things like if the door is closed or not and you will check the door repeatedly to ensure that Yes door is closed.
In contamination ocd you will feel uncontrollable desire to perform a task repeatedly. You will feel Anxiety whenever someone touch your phone, clothes or anything, if somebody touch your phone, one thought will trigger that his hands are not clean, he might have germs in his hands and he has touched your phone and now your phone is dirty, now because of this thought you will feel anxiety/fear and to reduce this anxiety what you will do is you will sanitize your phone, you will clean your phone, some people wash their phone also , I am also one of them who washed their phones.
In contamination ocd you will feel anxious after touching anything, any single thing because now you are thinking that your hands are not clean because you have touched the door . All you feel is anxiety anxiety and anxiety😰
In religious ocd, you will be noticing bad thought or very bad words about god. Like if you are doing prayer suddenly some bad thought will trigger in your mind related to God and then you will be feeling guilty that how can you think bad about God and then your ocd will tell you to say sorry to God immediately otherwise God wll not forgive you, now you will feel anxiety if you will not say sorry to God and because of your anxiety you will say sorry to God for the bad thought.
So this is related to religious ocd, which I described.
In any type of ocd you will feel anxiety and to reduce your anxiety you will do compulsions repeatedly.
I hope you will understand how you feel when you have ocd.

283,The defining features of OCD are obsessions and compulsions that cause distress and interfere with functioning. The best treatment for OCD is CBT including exposure and ritual prevention (ERP).,OCD
284,"I'm diagnosed OCD (30 years ago), and have made significant progress in dealing with it.
The cause(s) are probably some combination of heredity, environmental factors, and trauma. It's an “anxiety disorder,” in its basic sense: a person adopts repetitive behaviors in an attempt to reduce their feelings of anxiety - usually through distraction or doing something they think will improve their situation but it interferes with their ability to function normally.
In my situation, the medication “Zolaft” was the biggest game-changer in my life. I also did extensive behavioral therapy. But, the right medication made the biggest difference, by far. I had a lot of intense, long-term therapy to deal with my OCD. But, it completely disrupted the trajectory of my entire life. Basically, it took the entire decade of my 20's to deal with it.
I would advise you to seek out a very good, “Psycho-Pharmacologist.” They're basically a specialized Psychiatrist who can test your blood and pinpoint the exact medication that will work for you. It's expensive, but so is losing a decade of your life to OCD.",OCD
285,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts or obsessions and repetitive behaviors or compulsions. It affects approximately 2% of the population globally. OCD is an ego-dystonic disorder.
That means that its symptoms are invariably at odds with the self-image, and repugnant to the sufferer. If you think having OCD is positive or no big deal, you don't have OCD.
In contamination OCD, you will do one task multiple times, like you will wash your hands, you will clean the desk, you will wash your clothes multiple times, you will start doubting on simple things like if the door is closed or not and you will check the door repeatedly to ensure that Yes door is closed.
Contrary to the common belief, OCD is not about being tidy, organized, and so on. What OCD is, is a thought, or an obsession, creeping into your head, through sensory stimuli or a stream of thoughts, and getting all of your attention. It can last for hours, days, or weeks. The degree of intensity of the obsession varies based on different factors. Often times your head makes cases for it by prying on your loved ones or your deepest fears. It may also present itself as a utterly disgusting image or thought.
This triggers an emotional and physical response (a fight or flight response) which makes the obsession feel real to the person affected. What follows is a suggestion from your brain that is supposed to make everything right. It magically makes you save your loved ones, make your obsession disappear and your anxiety with it. It’s a compulsion. This is an action, usually with meaning associated to it, used to neutralize the obsession. It can be tapping, cleaning your hands and so on, either a specific number of times or until it feels just right. It can also be something degrading you don’t want to do.",OCD
286,"There are a lot of things that can contribute to what seems as if you have OCD. It is sometimes a need for control over some aspect of your life because of the many things that are outside your control. Having OCD tendencies is not always a negative thing. I was told by a therapist so long as my little quirks are not hurting anyone, then they are no big deal. I arrange things a specific way. Things have to be symmetrical on my desk. I have to make my bed. My bathroom counter is arranged in a certain manner. My clothes hang in my closet a certain way. I double check doors are shut. I’m tactile. I suffer from PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, and generalized anxiety. If the little things help, I’m all for it.",OCD
287,"i dont see why youd have to do anything about them unless it is harming someone. i have OCD about the oddest things and it stems from trauma.
i can not going to bed without playing with my locks and switches near the front door. flick on fick off fick on flic off flick on flick off, turn lock one way then the other then back, or somethimes i sleep walk and check locks on doors around the property.
stems from being attacked and not feeling safe in my own house. just let me play with locks before i go to bed for a minute. if the process is interupted or someone tells me i dont need to do it it will be maddening, i wont stop thinking about it till i get up and do it. or ill sleep walk.
if something is out of place or crooked i need to fix it, yet my place can be messy but i will vacumn a certain spot obsessively, for 10 minutes.
its not hugely noticeable ocd like im not a neat freak and can have disorder but man whn it comes to locks and switches im wierd. i had to do schooling last year and it had been a long time since i was back in school. i found out in an environment like school if i walk into the classroom i have to play with the light switches and check the door locks so i started showing up before everyone in the morning so they wouldnt think i was wierd, or no one would be in the classroom when i walked in and flicked the switches on and off and played with the lock hha. it wasnt a behavior i could simple tell myself i didnt need to do. if there was another door in the room id have to go to that door and play with those locks an switches.
i once had to tell the teacher in a classroom i needed her to unlock the back doorway to the other hall or i couldnt be in the room knowing that door was locked and i only had one way out.. yet im fine if theres only one door lol. if i feel stuck or unable to excape i goo a bit wonky lol",OCD
288,"Don't worry about it, because you don't have OCD. If you did, you wouldn't have to ask what was wrong with it, and you'd also know that having OCD has nothing to do with tidiness. I have OCD and while I'm not, like, a hoarder, I'm also not an overly tidy person at all.
OCD is an ego-dystonic disorder. That means that its symptoms are invariably at odds with the self-image, and repugnant to the sufferer. If you think having OCD is positive or no big deal, you don't have OCD. Period, end of story.
Liking your closet organized and your books arranged by subject doesn't mean you have OCD. Feeling your closet needs to be organized, or your books need to be arranged by subject, or else something catastrophic will happen to you or someone you love — that would be more an indicator of OCD.
I suspect your idea of what OCD is comes from the stereotype of OCD sufferers all being germophobes who are just obsessed with tidiness and/or cleanliness.*
As someone for whom OCD manifests in a completely different way than organization, tidiness, or germophobia, I get so tired of that stereotype, and of the idea that the disorder is nothing more than being anal or uptight. That's not what it is at all, and plenty of people without OCD are neat and tidy.
Having OCD means that your mind is never fully at rest. I rarely sleep more than four hours a night anymore, and as a result I'm almost always exhausted. I just can't shut my mind off and fall asleep.
I count every step, every swallow of water, and am fixated on “good"" and “bad"" numbers. I check my stove several times before leaving the house, even if I know I haven't used it since the last time I left the house. I also check my front door several times to make sure it's locked, every time I leave the house. A couple of months ago, on my way to my sister's house, I got about five minutes from home and then turned around and went back to check the lock one more time. Just to make sure. Because if it wasn't, something horrible could happen and it would be all my fault.
Does that sound like fun to you? Having intrusive thoughts that are constantly telling you something horrible is going to happen if you don't do things exactly a certain way?
Again: you don't have OCD. Thank your lucky stars for that. And please don't cheapen its effects on those of us who actually do, and know what hell it can be.
(*The other possibility is that you could have OCPD, or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is an ego-syntonic, Cluster C personality disorder characterized by a need for perfectionism and neatness, and in which you will not find your symptoms distressing. But you'd need diagnosis by a mental health professional to know for sure, and it's a distinct disorder of its own — not OCD.)",OCD
289,"The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not fully understood. It is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Some research suggests that imbalances in certain brain chemicals, such as serotonin, may play a role in the development of OCD.
OCD can be relieved through a combination of therapy, medication, and self-help strategies. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of therapy for OCD. It involves identifying and challenging negative thoughts and behaviors and learning coping skills to manage them. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be prescribed to help reduce symptoms. Self-help strategies, such as relaxation techniques and stress management, can also be beneficial in managing OCD symptoms. It is important to work with a mental health professional to develop a personalized treatment plan for OCD.

290,"Religious OCD involves blasphemous thoughts about God, such as cursing God, spitting at God, throwing trash, footwear, etc at Him, having sex with God, etc. These thoughts torment a believer and scare him as he fears the punishment that might come to him from God.
Generally, it is in a Pure O form, with no apparent compulsions. Sometimes though, there might be other obsessions also that may result in very visible compulsions.
Either way, identification of the apparent and hidden compulsions is the first step to recovery, as is the case in any other form of OCD.
Religious OCD is not an actual classification of OCD though. It is just a name given by people to isolate it from the other types.
Hope that helps.",OCD
291,"I have spiritual OCD, which is also called religious OCD.
For me, it all started back in 2018. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it. I mean, who doesn't have doubts sometimes.. but then it started getting worse. I'd constantly worry that I wasn't practicing my religion ""correctly"" or that I was committing some kind of sin without even realizing it.
One of the most common symptoms I experienced was this need to confess every little thought or action that I thought might be sinful. It felt like I was in this never-ending cycle of guilt and anxiety. I'd spend hours praying or performing rituals, hoping to ease the anxiety, but it never seemed to be enough.
Things came to a head in 2021 when I finally decided to seek help (got therapy from ‘Mantra Care’. 100% recommended). Therapy helped me understand that these thoughts were just a product of my OCD, not a reflection of my actual beliefs or values. Learning how to challenge those intrusive thoughts and not give in to the compulsions was tough, but it was so worth it.
There are still days when those thoughts creep in, but I've learned how to manage them better. I don't let them control me like they used to. I've also found a lot of comfort in connecting with others who have similar experiences. Knowing that I'm not alone in this struggle has been incredibly reassuring.",OCD
292,"It’s a lot of things for each individual. Religious obsessions are circular thoughts about doing evil, which of course the God upstairs will punish with everlasting fire. The terror of hell causes the Pure O sufferer to do all sorts of things to alleviate the fears of the afterlife, and to end the vicious cycle of bad thoughts.
They might pray 2 hours a day, fast, and read their Bible two hours every morning. In their mind they will do rituals, like silent prayers and repentances over and over again. They might go to church 5 days a week, thinking that God will really show up and heal them of their bad thoughts. Of course, none of this works as Pure O is a mental problem, just like a heart problem, liver problem, foot problem, or knee problem.
Sadly, struggling with Pure O in this way is like trying to pull your fingers out of finger cuffs. The harder you pull, the stronger the grip on your fingers. Basically, the...

293,Any thought that is related to your religion and keeps coming to you again and again. That is a religious obsession. It can be something like you have to worship some god or deity otherwise you’re very anxious. Or something like you have to curse god otherwise you feel very anxious. Sometimes it can be something like you have to repetitively take gods name. So there are multiple different presentations. And there is an action associated with the obsession that helps to relieve the thought and distress related to the thought.,OCD

295,"From my own personal experience:
Very distressing, near violently vivid mental images of God hurting me for anything and everything that I did—mainly at night. Paranoid since he knows all my thoughts and feelings; following me around.
Sleeplessness and insomnia due to the repetitive, vivid and blasphemous thoughts
Extreme guilt, shame, and panic
The incessant urgency—praying, asking forgiveness, praying again, and again; unshakable urge to reassure yourself with multiple religious items: church, scriptures, pastors and relatives holding your same faith.
Never being satisfied with the amount of times you pray, read the Bible, or go to church. You have to keep doing them over and over, with no sense of doing enough for the day.
Doubting that you are even a good, faithful Christian despite having absolutely NO solid evidence of you being otherwise. Mental checking of your past and overanalyzing.
Feeling that God has abandoned you and will stop forgiving you and listening to you. That he has a limit, or holding a sin against you, writing a list of wrongs, etc.
Getting anxiety triggers by mentions of God, the Bible, going to Church etc. and then feeling very ashamed.",OCD
296,"Religious OCD, also known as scrupulosity, is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in which a person's obsessions and compulsions revolve around religious or moral beliefs. This can manifest in various ways, such as excessive guilt or fear of sinning, excessive focus on religious rituals or rules, or intrusive thoughts about blasphemy or religious taboo. People with religious OCD may feel a constant need to confess or seek reassurance from religious figures, and may struggle with doubts and uncertainty about their beliefs. This can significantly impact their daily life and cause distress and impairment.

297,"Imagine a person wielding a gun.
The gun is made of plastic but somehow you are convinced that it is actually real.
The person then asks you to do what he says and obviously you wouldn’t defy him owing to this belief that the person is wielding a real gun that can infact hurt you.
The man asks of you to go and check the lock for the door — about 50 times.
Then he asks you to check the knobs of the gas stove — about 100 times.
So the strange requests goes on and obviously you would oblige to these requests because you believe that if you don’t do as the person with gun says — you will get hurt.
This is OCD.
When your mind has somehow convinced you that if you don’t perform this compulsions, you can face dire consequences.

299,"Hi 😅 I know that this is an older question, but since it hasn't been answered yet, I'd like to give my own experience with it.
I've had a lot of different types of OCD. There's been a lot of morphing. I had religious OCD as a Christian 7–9 year old (I'm not religious anymore, or a 7–9 year old).
I was afraid that if I didn't do my rituals, I'd be sending people to Hell. Strangers, my family, myself. My rituals included completely unnecessary steps like jumping up and down once, blinking “just right"" 5 times, and tapping my feet to the side 3 times to make a nice 9 items in total. There were other rituals, but I remember this being one of my routines.
I'd also pray every night. I'd plead God not to send anyone to Hell, especially my family, and to let everyone be happy in the afterlife. Then I'd do some other ritual, finish the rituals for my other obsessions, and go to sleep.
I felt like my obsessions and compulsions (I didn't know what they were at the time) were the burden I had to carry. I thought my suffering was out of God's hands and that I must get through it on my own. I also thought the devil was following me, waiting for me to make a mistake so that he could send me to Hell. I was always on my best behavior because of the fears I carried.
Eventually, I morphed out of religious OCD and into other types. I still remember what it was like though.",OCD
300,"Bruce Wayne, also known as Batman, is a complex character in the DC Comics universe, and various interpretations of him have explored different psychological aspects. While he is not explicitly diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the canonical comics, some storylines and analyses suggest he exhibits traits that could be associated with OCD, such as perfectionism, a strong need for control, and repetitive behaviors.
In particular, his meticulous nature in planning and executing his crime-fighting strategies, as well as his obsessive focus on his mission to combat crime, can resemble aspects of OCD. Additionally, some adaptations, including films and animated series, have portrayed him as struggling with his mental health, which allows for interpretations that might align with OCD characteristics.
Ultimately, whether Bruce Wayne has OCD can vary depending on the writer's portrayal and the specific storyline. However, he is often depicted as a character with deep psychological complexities, including trauma and obsessive tendencies, which contribute to his identity as Batman.",OCD
301,"This is my pet headcanon so buckle up.
First, a definition. OCD is, according to Psychology Today, “an anxiety disorder in which people have unwanted and repeated thoughts, feelings, images, and sensations (obsessions) and engage in behaviors or mental acts in response to these thoughts or obsessions. Often the person carries out the behaviors to reduce the impact or get rid of the obsessive thoughts, but this only brings temporary relief. Not performing the obsessive rituals can cause great anxiety. A person's level of OCD can be anywhere from mild to severe, but if left untreated, it can limit his or her ability to function at work or school or even to lead a comfortable existence at home or around others.”
Bruce is obsessed with control—over his grief, over his city, over making sure no one else suffers like he did, over making sure his perfect plans to accomplish all that go through. That’s what OCD is—an irrational belief that if you do a thing, you can get rid of the thought and the accompanying emotions. From what we’ve seen of him, Bruce having OCD is highly plausible, especially since he probably wouldn’t seek help for it.
Things that Bruce canonically has done in the main universe:
Completely removed any sign of his son Jason from the house after his death, and avoided saying his name or mentioning him, to the point that Dick had to find out from others.
Kept detailed plans on how to take out his friends should they turn evil, even after those plans were repeatedly seized and used by villains against them.
Said that killing the Joker or anyone would immediately make him irredeemable and send him hurtling down the slippery slope to becoming just like his enemies (scrupulosity)
Refused to use guns, and distrusted others for doing so (note: some stories have him study how to use guns, even though he never actually does in combat)
Named everything with “Bat”
He cannot stop these behaviors. He is driven by these fears, even as they have positive outcomes. This has been shown to negatively affect his life (workaholic tendencies, personal danger, endangering his relationships, excessive planning being hijacked, etc.), but he is unceasing.
Update: As of the Sanctuary Files, Bruce Wayne has been canonically confirmed to have OCD.",OCD
302,"According to the Sanctuary Files, yes.
I already gave my take on this here.
Furthermore, I’d argue that being able to keep on functioning is not necessarily a sign that he does not have OCD, especially since, if we argue that his obsession is protecting everyone, we do see that his prioritizing of it can make healthy sleep, relationships, and other self care impossible.
One element of OCD is that it often attacks and warps the sufferer’s fears and loves. A deeply religious person might deal with religious obsessions and compulsions, and a very kind, pacifistic person might deal with intrusive violent thoughts. Bruce is a caring person, and the Bat is not solely a manifestation of OCD. However, the way in which he overprepares and prioritizes his rules and need for control over all else can be argued to go to the level of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
(Furthermore, while OCD must take up at least an hour of time per day, that’s a guideline. When I suffered from primarily mental compulsions, they consumed nearly every waking moment of my day, but I still managed to pull off a somewhat ditzy existence. When asked the hour thing, I couldn’t, and still can’t, say whether it qualified.)",OCD
303,"Depression
This depression was first seen following the death of his parents;wouldn’t you have become depressed after your parents died? I think the proper term is that Batman suffers from melancholic temperament. He loves black: his costume is black, his favorite animal is nocturnal, and he’s a night person.
2. Post-Tramatic Stress Disorder
After the death of his parents; Bruce kept having hallucinations about them, even long after they died
3. Coulrophobia
Batman's greatest advisory is his greatest fear. He won't kill the joker; the Joker has caused him immense sadness, and he can't get the Joker out of his mind (he keeps a joker card in his cave)

304,"OCD is a very misunderstood disorder (You can’t be “a little bit OCD”. I don’t care if you like your stationary at right angles, you either are or you aren’t, and it shouldn’t be trivialised), which doesn’t always manifest itself with the traditional symptoms we know from popular culture.
Firstly, let’s break down the condition. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is an anxiety disorder composed of two parts: Obsessive Thoughts and Compulsive Behaviours. There is more to it than that, but let’s keep things simple.
Bruce Wayne clearly suffers from some sort of obsessive thought pattern. As his backstory is fairly standard throughout most of the comics, we can attribute this mostly to the childhood trauma he suffered. Sufferers of OCD experience some relief of their anxiety when they carry out the compulsive behaviour, but this behaviour does not necessarily have to manifest itself as a physical action. A ritualistic thought pattern can just as easily fill that role. A thought pattern such as carrying out justice against those who would harm innocent people may fit the bill for relieving the anxiety of an obsessive replaying of the memory of parents murdered in an alleyway, perhaps? I can’t say for certain as I am neither a trained professional nor able to interview Bruce Wayne and find out.
Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) states that:
OCD is diagnosed when the obsessions and compulsions:
Consume excessive amounts of time (approximately an hour or more)
Cause significant distress and anguish
Interfere with daily functioning at home, school or work, including social activities and family life and relationships
Bruce Wayne is certainly plagued by anguish and dread, is often forced to change plans in his life to accommodate the actions of Batman, and spends hours a day dressed as the Caped Crusader tackling crime and injustice wherever he can find it.
However, the distinction that needs to be made, an one which is emphasised in the link above, is that OCD is a debilitating disorder. Sufferers only receive a very temporary relief of their anxiety before having to carry out their compulsive behaviours again. While Bruce Wayne constantly returns to the actions of his alter-ego, there seems to be no escalation or self-reinforcement of the behaviour which is common in those left undiagnosed.
Furthermore, many sufferers realise that the obsessive thoughts are irrational, while Bruce Wayne embraces them and founds his entire life upon them. Despite these thoughts he becomes successful and manages to keep his secret identity hidden for many decades.
In summary, it seems highly unlikely that Bruce Wayne suffers from OCD. There may be other issues he needs to work through, but to the best of my knowledge he does not display the characteristic anxiety of an OCD patient.
NOTE: I repeat that I am not a trained professional, I only studied the topic a little in college. If anything I have written seems inaccurate (In regards to OCD, not the fictional case study) please let me know in the comments.",OCD
305,"Yes,he even admitted this to Wonder Woman on why he wouldn't date her.

As you can imagine, Diana doesn't take it well and crushes the gargoyle beside her and asks him “Next?”",OCD
306,"Not exactly
If we could put it in context Batman is not crazy. He is more than capable of understanding the difference between what is right and wrong, and therefore it is not right to assume Batman is crazy.
If he is crazy, he wouldn’t be a respected leader and a force that commands gods.
In their day, they were the truest representatives of their kind… one of the zeniths of human fortitude and ambition
Batman is not a psychopath either. He doesn’t just go around punching people for fun.
Batman isn’t crazy, he has strong moral codes and rules. Batman will not kill.
Will he go crazy?”
Batman spends most of his time surrounded by criminals who abuse, torture, and kill, he finds the willpower or barrier to avoid the negativity and recklessness as a psychological reminder to retain his sense of sanity.
Batman is often a character associated with obsession. Sure Batman can become obsessive and often controlling over what needs to be done and how it needs to be done, but Batman knows the difference between what’s right and what’s wrong and understands that his mission, means to attain justice and order for all.
Batman knows the justice system in Gotham is messed up. But Batman didn’t become Batman to replace the justice system, rather he became Batman to assist the justice system, to help create order in Gotham.
Bruce is a man of intense will and self-discipline. This sense of will and self-discipline is a trait that strengthened over the years, it’s his motivation.
Conclusion:
Sure Batman may not be the happiest person on Earth, but I don’t consider him to be depressed or crazy.
He is just complex
There you, decent reasons to show that Batman ain’t crazy.

And if he is not voicing them, others do. And he knows it.
He said it later. “You were right"".
This topic is most prevalent in his interactions with his family. And Clark. Bruce knows his trauma, his obsessive and borderline paranoid nature. He is well aware of it. And he doesn't want anyone else to have it. To be like him.
He knows. That is literally his internal motivation to push until there is still a breath in his body. He knows he doesn't cope with loss very well. But here is the thing. He is not normal in many other ways too. Positive ways. His brain function very differently from any regular human. He in essence does not have limits. Or at least do not acknowledge them and pushes further. Alfred said it the best.
“He has a mind like no other. I have grave doubts either of us will ever fully comprehend it's decisions.”
And he is right. For all intents and purposes Bruce's mind is special. He isn't like all the other Bats. Regular, ordinary. Even geniuses like Tim look pale in comparison. And neither is his comping mechanism. He doesn’t have one. It is unhealthy. Destructive even. But that is how he works.
So yes. He knows his mental state. Only, so what? He was treated as a child. He just outsmarted both Leslie and Alfred. He do not react to trauma in the same way. Or just buries it and continues what he does best.
Tell me which other Bat could still go on with everything that happened. His parents. Barbara. Jason. Tim. Natalya. Silver. Jezebel. Andrea. Vesper. Golden. Steph. Damian. Talia. Alfred! You know, almost every Bat died at one point or another. I could go on even with regular acquaintances. Cops. Countless victims and children he simply can't always help. And yet? He still fights. Because if he didn't? The number would be even worse.
Batman is fully aware he isn't exactly normal. And even he sometimes breaks down.

308,"The guy dresses up as a Bat and fights crime at night because his parents were murdered in front of him as a child, he obviously has some mental issues
But I don't think he is crazy although the idea has been toyed around with
A couple of times",OCD
309,"We can say he has. In his childhood, the crucial transitional period for his physical and psychological development, he experianced a mental trauma, caused by the violent death of his parents. Disorders like OCD are mostly the effects of such trauma, and its' appearance is, we can say, an incarnation of the same, where the person has a need to, in some way, beat that trauma and insecurity by some patterns of his/her or constant actions which makes them sure the trauma and pain won't happen again. In Wayne's case, it was a rigid training and preparation for the villains, which are, methaphorically, the killers of his parents.",OCD
310,"Difficulties in my Life
OCD
Loss of pets
Natural disaster destroying all that I know in 24 hours and causing me to relocate unexpectedly as a child
Loss of many people who were very close to me (incl. my grandparents who helped raise me)
Witnessing people pass away and struggle with fatal disorders
Being called fat constantly
Eating as a way of suppressing the pain
Being bullied throughout school and feeling suicidal
Feeling scared that people would judge me, and not wanting to take my medications
Fear that I would lose control of my mind and wind up in a hospital
Neverending guilt for my past mistakes
Finding comfort in my Faith, Christianity, but having my ocd attack this after being told that certain doctrines were incorrect
Fear of failing; perfectionism
severe depression
Out of this, I can say the most difficult thing in my life is OCD. You see, everyone can draft a list like this, but only some fight with their mind while doing so. One of the things I learned to help with depression is that for every “bad” we list there are many more “good” events. Having someone else make a list of good things with me was very healing.
Yes, OCD is a significant concern to me. My faith is still a rock in my life. However, I yearn for the day to be normal, to wake up without intrusive thoughts. Would it change my life? Completely. I do not know if there would be a greater relief besides my Salvation.
As for the question of genetics, Im not sure. One of my parents had it, but I know that there are others without genetics. It had to start somewhere, right?
If anyone else on here is struggling, you are not alone. We can talk anytime.",OCD
311,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
312,"It’s a disorder, which means it upsets systematic functioning, so yes it is unhealthy.
Its important that you attend cognitive-behavior therapy if you have it. Having an outlet where you can express the discomfort you’ve been feeling is essential for keeping it contained. Most people take some sort of seratonin-reuptake inhibitor to keep the compulsive thoughts at bay.
I watched a good TED talk where the woman speaking lectured about the importance of “starving the monster.” The monster, in this case, is the part of your brain that’s telling you to feed the obsessive thought. By “starving” it, you take an active approach against it. You identify the thought in your head, visualize it, and tell yourself that you’re not gonna feed it. Eventually, if you do it right, the thoughts will slowly fade away and become less disturbing.
I feel I should emphasize the fact that few( if arguably any) OCD cases are the same. It can range from a mild intolerance to an out of control ritual. For example, my OCD is based on the smell of metallic objects and bad grammar( two things that seemingly don’t go together). It manifested after I started to have panic attacks over the smell of pencil lead. In the grand scheme of it, my case is mild, as I’ve been able to contain it well since being diagnosed.
Is there a good thing to having OCD? Well, not really. It’s mostly a big pain in the ass. However, I will say that people with OCD are sane, and are mostly aware of the fact that they’re doing something irrational when they’re acting on their thoughts. It’s not the worst condition you could have.",OCD
313,"Yes. It’s a disorder for a reason.
It can range from mild symptoms, such as washing hands repeatedly, being overly-routine with certain things, or doing a certain action such as changing underwear every time you go to the bathroom, or it can be severe, such as intrusive thinking about choking on food and not eating.
Sometimes OCD can cause extreme paranoia that borders on psychosis, such as thinking people will break into your house and being so paranoid that it causes other issues like insomnia or obsessively checking rooms in your house to make sure nobody is there.
In any case, yes, it’s detrimental, and can, in some cases, requires mandatory hospitalization if the person is unable to care for themselves.",OCD
314,"Is obsessive-compulsive disorder a disease?
The word “disease” has a specific meaning within medicine and may involve particular criteria that have to be met for diagnosis.[1]
OCD is considered to be a mental illness.[2] [3] The word “illness” might be more generic than “disease”.
I’m not sure what difference labeling your experience as a disease, disorder, syndrome or condition makes. You don’t feel well and you want the symptoms and their causes to be dealt with. That is the focus that matters most.

315,"Yes.
Having any disorder, by definition, is unhealthy, or it wouldn’t be considered a disorder.",OCD
316,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
317,"Does it matter? If it interferes with your life, see someone who specializes in treating your condition.",OCD
318,"Ocd when channeled appropriately can be an asset in creativity, high achievement, education, anything that requires alot of practice and skill, like music, sports, or other occupation that is specialized.
However, if left unmanaged, it can be a handicap in general or overall functioning, because it uses up alot of time, energy, thoughts, and money that can be allocated elsewhere.
Overall, I’d say yeah it’s kinda bad, but you can minimize the symptoms and go from severe to moderate or mild.
What else can you do? There probably is no cure, just managment techniques like meditation, nutrition, budgeting, therapy, and maybe some supplements. :-)
Acceptance is the first step to recovery. Admiting and acknowleding there may be a problem or imbablance. It is a symptom of addictive personality and may be genetic or run in families, not just biochemical, or neurological. There is much to know about brain science, but the trigger seems to be a loss or PTSD, anxiety or stress.
The key is to not allow bad habbits to sabotage your life. (Like compulsive shopping that puts you into debt so you feel anxious so you over eat, then you gain weight, then you have lower confidence when applying for a job, so you work part time, so now you can’t afford school, so you stop nourishing your brain, so you get depressed, so you…. borrow more money for a temporary solution to make yourself feel better or distracted….and after all that you are too tired to put away the items you bought or clean up the mess you made!)
OCD can be very bad when channeled into hate crimes, substance abuse, violence, obsessions with revenge, or other dysfunctions.
But, it is more common than the statistics are reporting. I would say maybe 1% of the global population might have a variation of it.
Symptoms can be addiction to the internet or technology, or quora hahahahahahahaha. :-) So, if you have a broad definition of an umbrella of OCD, OCPD, Super OCD, and even Addiction, maybe even more % of people have it but are undiagnosed.
But, labeling it as “bad” just reinforces the stigma that mental health has and hinders progress. Keeping an open mind is good.
We all have issues. We have to exercise sound judgement and for this, we seek self help, self improvment, and outside help.
People who work 70 hours a week (workaholics) hoard money.
Are they any more or less balanced than any other hoarder? Say an animal hoarder… (I’d rather have cats) so people value things differently.
So, it is all relative to “how does this serve you”.
We have control over what we choose to associate pain or pleasure with.
I don’t know if OCD spectrum is a degenrative disease like dementia or alsheimers, that can get worse with time, I guess all diseases are this way to a point if left untreated. I am not a neuro scientist. So, it is maybe not as bad as cancer, which spreads. Is OCD an electrical current misfiring in the hypothalamous, or caused by a tumor or trauma pushing on the region of the brain? Each person is unique.
There was one case of an active shooter who had a tumor on the emotional region of his head, upon autoptsy. So, that would be bad. He developed intrusive thoughts about hurting people. He even left a sort of suicide note complaining about headaches. I believe it was at a Texas University in the late 1960s. I forgot his name, in a tall tower. He fired into the student from the clock tower above, in a mass shooting. I believe all domestic terrorists have OCD.
Clearly if it is affecting other people in a negative way, it might be bad.",OCD
319,"OCD is a truly painful condition and I am sorry for anyone who has to endure it. I first started experiencing symptoms when I turned twelve. Since my intrusive thoughts are religious in nature, my condition went undiagnosed until I turned sixteen.
I honestly thought that I had lost touch with reality; I remember feeling like everywhere I went these thoughts would follow me. I felt that I could not really explain my problem to anyone because they would not understand it, and when I tried to…they didn’t.
Finally, when I found out that OCD can be of a moral/scrupulous nature, I was able to understand what was happening to me. My parents took me to a Psychologist and I received an official diagnosis.
After I learned that my thoughts were the result of a mental condition and were not going to go away, I remember feeling extremely depressed. I thought that I would always grapple with this issue and had been handed a mental millstone to carry around.
Then, I started going to therapy. My therapist utilized exposure-response prevention and helped me to rewire my brain. Even though I had known before that my thoughts were irrational, I felt like my brain was finally starting to understand that too. I started to notice that the “volume” of my thoughts became lower and I was able to function better. I had an easier time sleeping and eating, and I felt like I could enjoy being around my friends.
There are many people who suffer from anxiety conditions, which I am sure you know. “Normal” anymore is subjective and most people aren’t. I am just one person and my experience may not be yours, but I can say that my quality of life has significantly improved since getting professional help.
I still have thoughts that bother me, but have experienced significant relief from my symptoms. Some are able to achieve complete remission.
In short, a good life is possible despite having OCD.",OCD
320,"Yes, Rafael Nadal has publicly acknowledged that he exhibits symptoms consistent with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). He has spoken about his need for routines and specific habits, particularly in his preparation for matches. Nadal's routines include various rituals and behaviors, such as how he arranges his equipment and his pre-match rituals, which he has described as essential for his focus and mental preparation. However, he has not formally diagnosed himself with OCD; rather, he has mentioned these tendencies in interviews, highlighting how they play a role in his competitive mindset.",OCD
321,"High level athletes, especially those who have a set piece in their repertoire (Free Throw shooting, shooting sports, golf, etc), All have pre-shot rituals that put them into an altered state for that action. This helps them be consistent, accurate and precise through a process of visualization and focusing on the moment. It is the result of a lot of work and coaching (not to mention talent.)
I did a casual study of tennis players at the US open many years ago in which I timed the players from the first action of their serve (usually a bounce of the ball) till when they hit the ball. If they were within a certain window, the ball was always in but otherwise it was out. A similar study - one that is much more sophisticated - has been done with free throw shooters in which the ritual (timing, number of bounces, twirls and body adjustments) showed much the same thing in elite level players (NBA.)
So this is actually the opposite of OCD. OCD is driven by anxiety and rituals are a response to that anxiety. Pre-shot rituals have the effect of calming the player down and allowing him or her to focus on the immediate while all the skills go on automatic. They are a result of long training and parsing out the distracting and inefficient aspects of the action. In this case, Nadal goes through the same ritual and hits an amazing serve. Anyone who copied him would not do the same thing as these rituals are always individual. (That study I mentioned had this as one of the observations in the conclusions.)
So the answer is no, Nadal is not demonstrating OCD when he serves. It is unlikely he has OCD, at least not a serious enough version that it handicaps him in life.",OCD
322,"No, and I’m fairly certain of it for 2 reasons:
I lived for 2 years in the same room with a person who had the OCD
I’ve seen Nadal out of the courts and in normal life situations.
Someone who truly has the OCD disorder has to do certain rituals or they feel a strong sense of anxiety and in the worst cases, they can’t function properly during the day and in normal life situations.
Nadal is actually pretty messy in his normal out of court life. He states this in his biography and I could see it live. He didn’t show any of the symptoms of an OCD disorder.
Most people confuse his rituals (that are mostly done as a habit to stay focused during a match and to have the feeling of control over the match) with the OCD disorder.
If he truly had it, we would see him losing control on the court when he can not perform his rituals. Sometimes he doesn’t do all of them because lack of time and he is just fine.
During training sessions, I only saw him picking his pants a couple of times, just like sometimes I am so used to wear glasses and adjust them that when I wear contacts I find myself adjusting nothing :) The force of the habit!
During his training sessions, he doesn’t align any water bottle, nor he touches his shoulders or any other thing he does on the court during matches. If he truly had an OCD disorder he couldn’t help himself doing all these things no matter what the context is.
The disorder is compulsory and brings a high level of anxiety, something I haven’t seen when he is training normally. He even smiles (although it does it rarely during training), meaning that the fact he is not performing his rituals doesn’t stress him out one bit.
The OCD everyone sees is simply a way to focus on the game and force of habit.
The person I lived with for 2 years couldn’t stop the behavior and if she was forced to, you could clearly see her losing it completely. It’s a very stressful condition to live with and Nadal doesn’t have it.",OCD
323,"Maybe, but the reason he goes through all his mini-rituals before points is because for him, being in the zone is a very vital thing. Every time he rearranges his water bottles, touches his hair (or his shorts, or whatever), he is reminded of the fact that he’s in a tennis match. That it isn’t practice, or training. When on court, he is singly focused and these rituals reinforce that.
Another reason for him rearranging water bottles is so that he always has something to do when sitting on the bench. When playing a sport like tennis, a million things are running in your mind, like ‘I shouldn’t have hit that forehand that hard’ or ‘I need to make more crosscourt forehands’. If you have a set ritual that you perform everytime you go to the bench, you’re going to spend far less time worrying needlessly about things that don’t need any worrying. They’re obvious facts, you know what’s wrong, and you know how to fix them.",OCD
324,"You must be speaking about the way he adjusts the back of his shorts before each serve. It may be some OCD, and most probably want to get them some, because it doesn't seem to hamper his tennis game. So from that standpoint. no harm done. If he started wearing looser shorts and didn’t feel the need to adjust, his game may suffer.
Repetitive habits are common in sports. Basketball players develop routines before free throws, baseball players commonly have habits while batting.
If you’ve ever watched Derek Jeter at bat, he will step out of the box after each pitch and adjust his batting gloves. Basketball players shooting free throws will bounce the ball the same number of times before shooting. Golfers putting…endless routines.
Established routines obviously make them feel more comfortable.
I’m sure this has been brought to Rafa’s attention many times. He choses to keep doing it. In that sense, he doesn’t seem to care what the diagnosis may be. Would we like it better if he picked his nose repeatedly?
So forget OCD, PTSD, ADD, or any other disorder or malady. Just….
Keep pulling on those shorts Rafa…and cashing those checks.",OCD
325,"Clearly he does. His pre-serve rituals go far beyond habit. Also note the way he arranges his bottles on the changeovers. He seems to be adding tugs and pulls to the ritual, and once added they stay. They are clearly OCD without a functional purpose. I know this because I have tried adding them to my pre serve preparation and it hasn’t done me any good. I haven’t gotten any better.",OCD
326,"In my opinion, he does. As someone who is knowledgable about mental disorders, he is a classic example of someone with this condition. I have the same condition as well along with GAD (General(ized)) Anxiety Disorder, but my condition isn’t as noticeable as Rafa’s. The condition usually shows most when we’re under stress, and that’s why we have a “routine” that we like to go by- especially under stressful conditions. It’s kind of a safe zone for us if you can understand that and it makes us feel more in control of ourselves and what’s around us.",OCD
327,"Yes. His uncle and others have all but admitted it. I read an article recently by a psychiatrist who cautioned against shaming him for his ‘rituals.’ Lining up the water bottles by his chair is part of it too. A player knocked them over once and Rafa had a fit. He is a difficult player for me to watch — although I love his great shots — because of the series of motions he goes through to serve — the pants tugging and touching his face, ears, etc. It is distracting for me personally and not aesthetically pleasing. I have never denied he is great player and maybe will be the greatest of all time but I would say he is OCD.",OCD
328,"Many professional athletes have weird idiosyncrasies, but that doesn't mean they have OCD. A consistent routine, however weird, relaxes a person. It makes them comfortable and helps them perform better. Especially in pressure situations, it's good to have something calm you down and make you think it's a normal situation. It's a personalized placebo effect. Besides, you can't argue with Nadal's success. If it makes him happy, I say keep on arranging those bottles.
By the way, this question inspired me to ask the question:
What are the weirdest habits of professional athletes?",OCD
329,"As a tennis player and fan of Rafa’s, I’ve long wondered about this. His ritual includes not only tugging at his shorts, but bilateral tugging on the sleeves of his shirt at the shoulders, swiping hair back on each side, then pulling on his nose. (I had the pleasure of seeing him play live at the Miami Open.) The diagnostic question is this: does he do these rituals by choice or are they driven by compulsive imperative? That question is something none of us know. Perhaps he’ll write a memoir when he retires and put the question to rest. But, I hope that day is far in the future. The King of Clay is playing better than ever!",OCD
330,"Of course. Without an element of doubt. OCD will have occasional episodes initially but soon the rituals, compulsions, the time involved in obsessing and performing compulsions will rise steeply. Newer triggers get added and become anxiety causing stimuli. To the sufferer, understanding of what is happening with him and why things are going out of control becomes a mystery. His time with OCD increases and in that proportion, his life outside of OCD keeps getting smaller. It takes not much time for the severity to go up from mild to moderate, moderate to severe. Mind you, OCD is unpleasant, distressful, intrusive, involves senseless rituals and is anxiety causing. Plus, the compulsions may spoil his physical health like skin in case of contamination OCD that involves excessive scrubbing, increased water usage may cause him other health issues. The sufferer seems withdrawn, loses interest from other aspects of his life including his responsibilities, personal life, career, social life and gets into the grip of OCD if he is untreated for this problem. OCD could govern his life at this rate. Untreated OCD also may lead to suicidal thoughts.
Hence, getting it treated on time is very important.
You may write to me if you need help with counseling. My contact details are in my profile.",OCD
331,"I’m very glad I sought help for OCD.
Talk therapy helped me. (I was unable at the time to find a CBT therapist in my area but I feel that other therapy did help).
Medicine definitely helped me. I am better off for having sought help.
If you have compulsions, then CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) is recommended. It turns out that I sort of did CBT on my compulsions without knowing what it was I was doing when I was younger. I’m sure it would be more difficult to do on your own if you have more severe compulsions than I did. I’ve heard it is easier with a trained therapist of CBT. There are many proven good results from doing this type of therapy.
CBT can help with obsessions, too.
If you don’t want to see a therapist, you could try reading OCD self-help books.
One thing I learned from an OCD-knowledgeable psychiatrist that changed my life was how much OCD was still affecting my life. He’d had a lot of experience with OCD patients and when I told him about my life he was able to spot the things that were OCD.
I had thought for a time that I was pretty much done with OCD. I believed that because I’d mostly gotten rid of my compulsions (using CBT on myself) that I didn’t have OCD anymore.
But once I learned how many of the frustrating things in my life were part of my OCD, it made it much easier for me to work on these issues and make progress with them.",OCD
332,"Definitely! OCD is very underrated, thanks to its high performing nature.
The society somehow feels that conditions that severely affect your daily activities physically require help.. That's nonsense!
I've had anxiety all my life, it helped me have good grades because I'd be 400% prepared and still feel that I've not studied enough to scrape through the pass mark. But then having it all my life deterred any trust I could afford, and it started making me feel hopeless. I always feared the worst case scenarios in anything I did. I even restrained myself from a lot of things because of my anxiety.. Good or bad, it helped me live a rather organised life
I decided to take help very recently as it was getting a little too much to deal with generalised anxiety, social anxiety and OCD. I knew I was not living the normal life though it's the ideal life I could ask for in the eyes of my society..
Getting help was the greatest spontaneous thing I did for myself. With medication, I started seeing visible reduction in my anxiety. I am more happy, I live in my present. I don't feel stressed out, left out or lost. I still have OCD but it only helps me being organised. It doesn't bother into my mental peace!",OCD
333,"Yes! In one way or another, get help.
Ive had OCD since I was in elementary school( now I'm 44). The severity of my OCD had varied, gone up and down over the years.
Because of my OCD , I want able to complete my studies in college, and lost many jobs , didn't eat much or at all, became a recluse, was very sleep deprived, all my rituals got in the way of living my life optionally or even keeping it timetable, I became so depressed because I could not solbe my OCD and I did not know I could get help, I lived in Belgium at the time, and seeking therapy there is hard, since mental health/ illness is sort if just dismissed( or at least it was then) .
At some point when I moved to california, and OCD started increasing again, I sought help with a tgerapust who wad also a psychiatrist, he prescribed Luvox, it really worked, so well that I felt like I was a different person, it was sort of scary, but I learned to get comfortable with it and the quality of my life greatly improved without all the OCD obsessions, rituals. …unfortunately, after 7 months Luvox “popped out “, icrrasing the dose made no difference, waiting several months and trying it again never worked, nor did any other meds or DBT, at lesat not in any lasting way.
I had no OCD symptoms for a few years, but it cane back after a couple of years, after getting divorced after moving to a new home.
My daughter started getting OCD when she was in second grade, she is still struggling now she's going to 7th grade. She does not want to see a therapist, so I have been helping her overcome it, through trial and error. I am gradually limiting her time to spend on her bed time OCD rituals, and the less time she spends on OCD rituals, the more time she has to do other things before lights out, I also encourage her to just be less oerfectionistic within her rituals, its all very gradual, but its actually getting better. I rally worry about OCD ruining many years of my daughters life and many oportunities, as it did with me. But, I know it will not get so bad for her,because in helping, and if I cant anymore, she will go to a therapist for that.
Anyway, if you don't have a close relationship with someone who understands and is willing and able to try and help through trial and error, I strongly suggest you see a therspist who has a lot of experience with treating OCD.",OCD
334,"It’s ruined my brilliant life ,a life which could have been the envy of everyone given my above average intelligence and brain.Two decades and despite medication etc it hasn’t stopped and won’t ever.Though during my sober periods I know it is OCD and nothing else ,not me still when it strikes and now more often it debilitated me completely.I just shut myself up ,cry and look forlorn .The medicines numb me .All the people way behind me in every aspect are riding high in life ,laughing ,chilling ,enjoying and doing pretty good .And me ,I am lying on my bed ,very disturbed and not even in my senses when OCD severes .In my case it just keeps changing forms .",OCD

336,"I mean how much does this hinder you as a functioning human being? How old are you? Do you work or do you go to school?
You can try therapy but I am not much of the believer of the healing effect of talk, talk is useful and eases the pain and anxiety but any chemical imbalance or brain malady is still there after the session is over. I am not even aware that medication is available for OCD but you might try it. If it does not work, just tryh something else. Research the side effects and health impact of the medication. It is a fine balance. I am on lithium at age 60, I would not have wanted to be on lithium for 40 years because there are always adverse effects. You must do a lot of homework, You are ill, but you can learn to cope and get better. No biggie. Only you can decide this or people close to you. What does your significant other say?

337,"Well then don’t go get tested & treated! If having OCD is not a problem for you, then it isn’t a problem, it’s just you! There is nothing anywhere that says you MUST get something taken care of to meet the statistical norms of society.
Just think how many things people go see doctors for, treat this & treat that, as it is such a problem for them. And for many people, whatever it is just isn’t a problem to them.
Have no worries, I’m sure you can find plenty of other things to worry about. We all can.",OCD
338,"If you can afford it, I would recommend treatment. OCD is tough. While it can be rewarded because it MAY lead to meticulous planning and consideration of options, it is a brutal disease that is often associated with both emotional and physical suffering.",OCD

340,"It’s no secret that smoking cigarettes has a lot of negative health effects. Stained skin, heart disease, and lung cancer are just a few of the many dangers that come with smoking. It is harmful for everyone whether the person is suffering from OCD or not. If nobody smoked, one of every three cancer deaths would not happen. Smoking can affect the thought of person having ocd. Smoking blooms intensive amount of energy in the person , It will trigger his thought leading him to make impulsive decisions without any second thought. He will take any rash and random decision as he is boosted by the energy beacause of cigarette.
You can refer this video to get more information and cure for it",OCD
341,"Smoking is generally dangerous for anyone, with or without OCD or any other mental health condition. Cigarette contains tobacco which has nicotine, an alkaloid, the main substance which causes addiction. Apart from affecting ones mental health, smoking also affects physical health and can cause severe health conditions like throat or oral cancer.
Answering the main question, does smoking becomes more dangerous for people suffering with OCD? I would say yes because smoking distorts our psyche and thought process and makes vulnerable to obsessive thoughts and associated compulsions. As cigarettes are stimulants, it gives our bodies a sudden jerk and flush energy. They also activate fight and flight response and makes more anxious. Smoking is addictive and addiction itself is a problem in itself so of course smoking becomes more dangerous for people suffering from OCD>",OCD
342,"Smoking does not seem to improve cognitive performances of patients with OCD, whereas it seems to affect impulsivity, thus worsening decision making ability and flexibility, possibly by an effect of nicotine on dopaminergic neurotransmission in orbito-frontal cortex.",OCD
343,I am guessing you mean marijuanna. From my personal experience If i smoked a strain that was high in cbd I could relax my mind easily. However if I smoked a strain high in thc I tend to become increasingly anxious and my pure OCD symtoms worsen.,OCD
344,"In my experience not at all.
I was afflicted with a type of OCD called “Pure-O”.
What this means is that I had the obsessions without the compulsions.
I developed an irrational fear that I was a bad person or would do bad things. These fears brought me great anxiety because I had no desire to commit these acts, thus indicating I was never in danger of actually committing them.
I ended up in a mental facility for two weeks where they realized and attempted to assure me, that I was not a danger to myself and others.
Through time and occupying my mind with other things, these thoughts subsided.
I still struggle with OCD, but those specific fears have not returned.
Hope this helps!",OCD
345,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
346,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

347,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD
348,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
349,"I'm assuming you mean smoking tobacco. If you consider nicotine addiction a mental disorder, then yes. I consider it brain damage with psychological symptoms.
If you look at when people start to smoke, and wait to see if they become mentally ill, you can't be sure that they weren't getting mentally ill first, and started smoking because they were mentally ill. So here's a look at what happens when people quit.
""Smoking cessation is associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and stress and improved positive mood and quality of life compared with continuing to smoke. The effect size seems as large for those with psychiatric disorders as those without. The effect sizes are equal or larger than those of antidepressant treatment for mood and anxiety disorders.""
That's from here:

(World that apply to vaping?)
There has been some buzz about smoking and psychosis. You might be familiar with some 2015 studies that detected a connection between marijuana use and psychosis in adolescents. They can't tell which came first, psychosis or THC, so the question isn't settled. The studies made some people wonder about nicotine and psychological disorders, and the findings have been the same. Although either substance could cause mental disorders, it's also possible that early symptoms of disorders are soothed by pot or nicotine. So it might look like the drugs caused mental illness, but it reality, it could be the other way around.
It wouldn't be ethical to randomly assign teenagers to start using tobacco or pot, especially if you thought it might make them psychotic, so a rigorous experiment isn't going to happen. Looking at the annual rates of new schizophrenia diagnoses among teens, we see a large increase between 1971 and 2010, from 5% to almost 16%.* Between 1975 and 2013, rates of daily smoking in 12-graders dropped from 30% to 7%. Marijuana use fluctuated, but was down overall in this study. If either drug causes schizophrenia, it isn't causing very much of it. It could be the psychostimulants used to on children who don't pay attention.
*Incidence of early-onset schizophrenia ‘increasing’
The most interesting thing about trying to answer this question was how hard it was to find the incidence of schizophrenic in the US, or anywhere. I finally found a figure of 4000 new cases a year. If you listened to Jeffrey Lieberman, you'd think it was 400,000. 4000 can't be right. The prevalence is about 1.5% of the population, which is about 5,000,000 people. But if new diagnoses come in at a rate of 4000 year, it would take 1250 years to accumulate those cases. So something's off...
Back to smoking...with what I went through on it and to get off it, and the degrees to which it altered my mood at first, I would say that it increases your chances of being miserable, and if you want a happy life, you can't even have one puff. ONE puff sent me into a dreamy, euphoric state that I have never other than that time and for a few weeks after. I didn't mean to get hooked. I just did. Took me 7 years to find the day when I could finally quit cold turkey.
The money I spent on cigarettes, if invested into Microsoft shares in 1986 (after I quit), would be $2,737,5000 today. If it went into McDonald's shares before I started smoking, I'd be getting $60,000 year in dividends and the stock would be worth about $8,000,000.",OCD
350,"Its possible. While OCD is a mental disorder that may develop or reduce based on different kinds of treatments, the autism usually doesn’t develop or may get reduced because its a broader range of disorder. Although neither of these disorders gets cured, but since OCD is a single mental disease, the severity of OCD may get reduced. But when some has ASD, the ASD does not need to be cured, but few things like verbal communication therapies are required. OCD may stem from ASD or genetics without ASD or both. However, an individual with ASD may have obsessive patterns or restrictive behaviors yet not having OCD. The difference is that, an individual with ASD having those things (restrictive behaviors/patterns) may not trigger compulsive thoughts like the case of OCD.",OCD
351,"Yup. They sure do. I have both.
My OCD however is small stuff like wanting to wash my hands alot of times. (germophobia)
I get cranky if I can't get soap on my hands. Happened when I used the restroom at MCDonalds two days ago. There was no soap to wash my hands and I almost refused to eat or leave the restroom. But of course It's MCDonalds, the fastfood giant so I got over it easier than normal.

I don't have the counting thing often. The only exception is if I'm using a reference for drawing and when it starts showing up… the motivation to continue drawing is gone.",OCD
352,"I’ve heard there is an overlap. Not many people with OCD have ASD, but a high percentage of ASD people have OCD. Same with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD). Those don’t typically involve ASD, but many (perhaps most) people with ASD, also have those, and other neuro-atypias.
I was diagnosed with OCD, ADD, and TS before being diagnosed with ASD. Those earlier diagnoses, in fact, put me on the trail that led to my Asperger’s diagnosis. That, and noticing some of my relatives on the spectrum. Autism also, in many cases, involves abnormalities in sensory processing (aversion to noise, for example). That was noticed in the first months of my life.
I now think that ASD is a kind of summary of my neurological divergences. So I can call all of it ASD, instead of being such an alphabet soup. It has the elegance of simplicity.",OCD
353,"My opinion, as a lay person who is on the spectrum, is that OCD is generally a component of ASD simply based on the diagnostic criteria.
I suppose OCD could be a completely separate thing, depending on the severity (as quoted from Attwood’s book), and I personally don’t feel compulsion to perform “meaningless rituals” as described in the DSM-V. Here is the quotation of the second set of criteria:
Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text):
1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns or verbal nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day).
3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interest).
4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
So the stereotypical OCD behavior, shown in items 1 and 2, don’t have to be present for a diagnosis of ASD, as long as items 3 and 4 are present. They are, however, part of the diagnostic criteria, and should be considered as subsumed into the overall disorder. I’m with the “anti-fuzzy thinking” group mentioned in the Wikipedia article; just call it ASD and be done with it.
Unless you have a strong attachment to collecting diagnostic initials, that is . . .",OCD
354,"OCD is a very common symptom for people in the autistic spectrum, and a highly common diagnosis for women in the spectrum who have been missed or misdiagnosed by the medical system. Some people include it in the spectrum, and I do sometimes.
However, the key here is that, just like autism and over 80 different chronic mental, emotional, and physical challenges that are skyrocketing in incidence, OCD is caused by inflammation.
The same interventions that reduce or eliminate autism challenges also reduce cancer challenges, heart disease challenges, diabetes challenges, dementia challenges in seniors, depression, anxiety, and all those other non-communicable, inflammatory diseases… and these also reduce or eliminate OCD.
Before the 1970s, health determinants (things that indicated whether you’d have vibrant health or suffer from various health issues) were almost all active lifestyle choices: nutrition, food, sleep, exercise, and most of all (by far), love.
However, we’ve been incorporating more and more challenging — and outright toxic — substances into daily life since, well, really the beginning of the industrial revolution, but most rapidly since the end of the first world war, when the governments of allied countries got strong-armed (by industrial moguls who had profited from the war) into finding peace-time uses for the gases which killed soldiers in the trenches, and for the factories which produced war weaponry.
This was the beginning of three stealth wars which are still building:
A war on insects
A war on microbes (germs?!)
A war on smells (body odour, anyone?)
Post WW1, many toxin-related diseases began to first creep up in incidence, and then emerge as exponentially-rising problems. During the 1970s, all of a sudden active and healthy lifestyle choices weren’t enough to keep people healthy, and it became environmental exposures at home, in learning and other institutions, at work, and at leisure which determined whether or how sick people would become.
50 years later, we’re beginning to reach the tipping point, where there are so few working-aged adults who are fully healthy that it’s getting difficult to afford to support the continually-rising number of children, already-vulnerable adults, and seniors with serious illnesses.
So is OCD on the autism spectrum? Is the autism spectrum on the inflammatory, non-communicable disease spectrum? These are questions that are hard to answer. The sole medical attributes all autistics share are:
Abnormally high toxic body burden as a result of impaired detoxification.
Brain inflammation as a side effect of leaky gut and high toxin accumulation.
Leaky gut (60% of population have no indication of digestive problems apart from inflammation elsewhere in the body) as a result of gut dysbiosis, or a microbial ecosystem crash to a much lower level of digestive capacity.
People with OCD share these 3 underlying health issues… but everyone with inflammatory disease has a leaky gut at the root of the inflammation, wherever and however that inflammation is showing up (depending on lifestyle, exposures to toxins, and health susceptibility).
I hope that gives you more context, even if it doesn’t quite answer the question…",OCD
355,"It is not unusual to find a comorbidity between OCD and Autism Spectrum. I specifically have these two diagnoses.
As a hobby I often read a lot of research papers on these kinds of things. I am not clinically trained.
My favorite studies talk about the perspective of what was diagnosed first.
“Individuals first diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders had a 2-fold higher risk of a later diagnosis of OCD”
Individuals diagnosed with OCD displayed a nearly 4-fold higher risk to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (IRR = 3.91, 95% CI = 3.46–4.40) later in life",OCD
356,"There is often comorbidity between:
Autism, bipolar disorder, ADHD, borderline, schizophrenia, depression and OCD.
Between all of them. Like borderline/bipolar. Autism/ADHD, OCD/ADHD and so on.
There are more comorbidity brtween some of them than others. Like schizophrenia and bipolar together is more common. And OCD and depression is more common.
It is likely even genetic. Meaning there is more and more research that shows that most of these disorders have a genetic factor (though they sometimes needsbto be triggered too.) And many of these disorders have the same genetic patters…
Genetic relationship between five psychiatric disorders estimated from genome-wide SNPs",OCD
357,"I am not sure if a significant number of Autistic people truly have comorbid OCD or if they are conflating stimming with OCD repetitive behaviors.
Both types of behavior would look similar to a behaviorist, but an Autistic person stims because they need sensory input and (from what I have read) a person with OCD has a compulsion to perform the behavior and it’s more like a reaction to a specific thought.
For example, an Autistic person may rock back and forth because it is calming.
An OCD person may wash their hands over and over because they touched something on the subway and they’re afraid the germs will make them sick.
I’m not sure how many Autistic people have both stimming and OCD repetitive behaviors, and how many are just assumed to be OCD because they like spinning things or folding paper because it delights them or calms them.",OCD
358,"OCD is anxiety based. I am a psychotherapist as well as someone with autism spectrum disorder. I have many obsessive behaviours and interests but they are to do with completion of patterns, things having certain form and structure, or are an obsessive interest where I want to know everything about a subject and be all consumed by my interests, but I don't have anxiety as a driver to it. If I straighten things and someone intentionally messes it all up I may be annoyed with them but I'm not anxious about it.
If I do the OCD tests I come up as having OCD traits but not having OCD because there isn't the anxiety, just as someone with OCD doing an autism test would have the obsessive behaviours traits but may not have autism.
I like patterns so if I touch every post in a street but can't touch one for some reason I will do my best to touch it but won't be anxious if I can't although I may be annoyed that I was unable to and as the pattern wasn't complete it would play on my mind (not worry or anxiety just thinking it isn't complete yet) until I complete the pattern in some way. Someone with OCD feeling they had to touch all the posts will have an anxiety driver behind it so they may think something bad will happen if they don't touch all the posts and so may get anxious because they hadn't completed the behaviour.
Humans are very good at habit forming and finding meaning so someone with compulsive behaviours can very easily start giving meaning and emotion to those behaviours, so someone with autism, especially given we want to control our environment and have certainties (for most people with autism) OCD could develop from these behaviours, but that would be an autistic person with OCD.
Hopefully this has explained enough?
All the best

359,"Daniel Jones’s answer is so good I don’t think I can equal it. He’s pointed to the essential difference — someone with OCD feels compelled to do something by anxiety if he fails, while those of us who are on the autism spectrum indulge in our special interests because we enjoy them.
In fact, they’re like a drug to us. If I’m anxious, my anxiety subsides; if I’m bored, I become interested. I suspect that they serve much the same role in us as human and physical contact does in neurotypicals. And if something calls me away from indulging in a special interest of mine, I don’t become anxious as someone with OCD would if a compulsion were interrupted. I’m just annoyed that I can’t continue.
Agree too with Dave Thompson that “special interests” is a better term than “restricted interests.” Low-functioning autistic people may have only one or a few interests but high-functioning autistic people typically have many. Hell, I’m interested in almost everything. A special interest is simply an interest that we’re more interested in than the others — in which regard we’re no different than anybody else. Just about everyone has some special interests, whether knitting or cooking or computers or collecting or music or cars or what have you. The difference is that we autistic people are more interested in them and more inclined to pursue them single-mindedly. It’s likely related to our tendency to hyperfocus, and what I call attentional/affective hysteresis — the extreme and sticky nature of our emotions and attention. That I think is why it seems to overlap with OCD, but as you can see, the motivations are actually quite different.",OCD
360,"Depression and OCD are two different conditions that require different approaches to treat. Treatment is not going to be “fast”, but it is going to be doable for someone with persistence and hopefully some professional help.
In general, what the two conditions share is that they are, in large part, a compound of negative self-talk and neurochemical imbalance.
The neurochemical imbalance can be treated medically, with psychiatric medication (or more basic medical treatment, if malnutrition or some other root cause is making the condition happen). This can be a difficult process, because not all medications work for all people, but with time and patience (and, in places where there isn’t universal healthcare, unfortunately money) the right combination of medications can often be found.
Treating the negative self-talk is a life-long endeavor. The main therapy technique for treating both conditions — which does work a lot of the time — is called cognitive behavioral therapy. Essentially, this therapy technique trains the patient to allow them to identify a downward mental/emotional spiral and pull themselves out of it. In the case of OCD, cognitive behavioral therapy generally involves accepting intrusive thoughts, rather than catastrophizing over them and letting them become overwhelming. I obviously can’t provide a full set of instruction in this answer, but there are plenty of worksheets and other tools used for administering therapy to oneself, and seeing a therapist for help is also a good idea.
Sometimes, other factors can be involved, like a negative environment. These generally need to be addressed differently for each person.",OCD
361,"You don’t escape illnesses, you go for evaluation and treatment.
There is no fast in this arena. It takes time, determination, and perseverance.
These illnesses may last a lifetime, and may benefit from lifelong treatment.",OCD
362,"What is the fastest way of escaping from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression?
Your word escape throws up many red flags for me. Can you escape diabetes or heart disease or kidney issues or whole host of physical health issues? Of course the answer is no but you can treat those in learn to live with those in a healthy manner. Any mental health condition is the same burning to live with who we are and what we struggle with in a healthy and productive manner is the goal.
I would really suggest that you start with a good physical grammar nation, find a good therapistYen work with a psychiatrist in case medication is needed he their short term or long term to help provide greater levels stability. Make sure your mental health team understands and can help you treat OCD, anxiety and depression related issues as well bipolar and PTSD because sometimes there is a connection there. These are all generally very treatable. You see only when we have a proper diagnoses can we find proper treatment for our symptoms. Best of luck. Btw this is not something to entrust your PCP with; mental health is not their specialty anymore than is heart or brain surgery so please see a specialist. Best of luck. Dale",OCD
363,"Yes, but most people don’t like it or won’t do it.
I’ve written a lot about this topic because I cured depression for myself and it took about a month for it to significantly improve and about a year for it to go away entirely. But a month is pretty damn good and if I’m being honest the change was felt even sooner than that, like a week.
Here is what I would do exactly:
Make a deal with myself, that from now on, with zero exceptions, I will only do what I want to do all the time no matter what. If this means calling in sick to work, staying in bed all day, fighting with friends, going on a drinking bender, so be it. If I’m going to be depressed, then at least I’m going to do what I want without guilt. This is key.
Next, I’m going to decide depression is curable. I don’t care at all about studies. I think therapists are dumb. I think modern science has it all wrong. For no reason at all, I think I’m smarter than all those people and I have decided for myself that depression is stupid and cringe, I’m done with it, it must be curable somehow, and I’m going to cure it. Because I’m the authority on me.
Then I’m going to make a list of my needs. These are normal needs. They might look different for other people, but this short list of needs is mostly universal:
Money (aka means to provide for myself and the people I love)
Healthy food (high protein, mid to high fat, natural carbs, no processed foods, reasonable caloric intake)
A strong body (capable of sprinting, swimming, pulling, pushing, hiking, hinging, squatting, aka foundational movements without pain or trouble)
Movement (you sweat everyday)
Sex (without guilt)
Community (people beyond family and significant other who I care about and care about me)
Sunlight (at least 30 minutes a day, often hours a day)
Autonomy & Freedom (the ability & mindset that I can do what I want and what must be done without guilt)
Healthy stress (stress from challenges, not constant threats to your livelihood)
Vision for your life
Now I’m going to compare my current, actual life to this list. How many of my needs are totally unmet? If I’m depressed, probably a lot. Take note and be honest.
Finally, starting today, I’m going to take action meet all those needs, as often as possible (without violating step 1)
The main issue in depression is you skip 1 and give away all your power. Once you give away your power, you are a victim to the people in your life, the authority you recognize, the demons in your mind—to life itself.
Once you can do step 1 and 2 with great sincerity, I honestly believe the remaining steps take care of themselves. When you decide to start living life on your own terms and be the authority in your own life, it’s only natural to start taking care of your own needs (steps 3 through 5).
But Step 1 is hard. Most people won’t do it.
Here’s what most people do. They get depressed. They want to stay in bed. But they know they have work. So they get out of bed and resent it. This makes them angry. But they can’t express their anger because they don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. So they bottle it up. Eventually they have a freak out. Then they hate themselves. Then they get depressed again.
It’s such a waste of time.
If you want to stay in bed, stay in bed. You want to call in sick to work, call in sick. You want to be a dick to somebody, be a dick. Who cares? My friend, this is your life. If you want to stop being depressed, you have to stop with this hemming and hawing over your own choices and your own life and become the absolute unquestioned authority on You. If you felt like being a dick or staying in bed all day, it’s because you decide and that has to matter to you more than anything.
Personally, I would say while I was curing myself of depression I was insufferable. When you go from a lifetime of self-loathing and sadness and resentments and anger and tears, to suddenly “I’m the boss of my own life no matter you don’t get to tell me what to do” it makes people around you mad.
And you’ll probably be a little annoying because you’re over-compensating. And you’re not good, you’re literally unskilled, at being the authority in your own life.
But after the first few weeks, it levels out. You give yourself permission to stay in bed once or twice, then you realize “Eh, I don’t really like doing that.” And because you’re the authority of your own life, you stop. Once you’re a total dick to a loved one or stranger too many times, you naturally feel bad about it, and you stop. All on your own.
This is a lot, but there is an “instant” cure (give it 30 days), I did it, and I can’t see why it wouldn’t work for most depressives. Just don’t skip step 1. Good luck.

364,"Stop trying. Suspend every single effort to “figure it out” and simply prioritize “learning to live with it”
Give it no more power over your emotions than something that you view casually and dispassionately.
Come to terms with the fact that you’re focusing on sensory stimuli, and then accept it. It won’t harm you, though your reacting to the fear might, and everything it tells you is false.
It’s like the Devil’s Snare from Harry Potter. Fighting the presence is what gives it presence. The only way out of the prison is to stop trying to escape. I know that’s counter-intuitive. It’s hard to act on when you’re dealing with ego-dystonic thoughts, but it is the only thing that will help you here.
It might also help to learn about how internal compulsions and rituals work.
If you think about a future event and start catastrophizing, thinking “I’m not going to be able to focus on this because of my sensorimotor OCD” and then avoid that activity, you’ve engaged in a compulsive ritual. It’s not the sensorimotor OCD causing you to lose things. It’s the avoidance tied to triggers that makes the disorder so disabling.
You can’t control what you think, but you can control how you react to it.
Focus on not needing to understand it. Fixate instead on achieving “calm” in an abstract manner, making whatever moves are necessary to reduce your anxiety levels.
Most importantly of all, remember.. the thoughts are temporary. Impermanent. Check again in 5 minutes and you’ll see that you spent 4 of those 5 minutes focused on rumination, not actually engaging in the stimulus.
You will never escape this mental prison by actively trying to escape. That will only make it worse.
Instead, you must learn to tolerate it.
Even seeking treatment can have a paradoxical effect of adding weight to the fears.
Minimize your response to it. Learn to process it neutrally or positively. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with focusing on a specific sensory stimulus, be it breathing, swallowing, blinking, whatever. What’s wrong is your internal narrative. You’re stuck in this because you’re telling yourself that you’re stuck in this. Learn not to do that. Let go of the idea of tangible episodes and simply allow yourself to have good days and bad days. It’ll be your greatest weapon in learning to live with this type of OCD.
The main problem you’ll face is relapse after remission. OCD won’t be cured. It can’t be cured. If you really stop to think about it, you’ll probably realize that this fixation on hyperawareness is actually pervasive throughout your life, and always has been. You can definitely reduce the symptoms, and quite plausibly eliminate the associated suffering, but.. you can’t rewire the part of your brain that evolved to have this problem. You can only learn to live with having the problem. As soon as you’re past the sensorimotor component of your OCD, it’ll shift to another topic. That can’t be stopped. You’ll always have free-floating OCD. It’ll latch onto whatever the hell it needs to in order to convince you that you have a problem.
But you don’t.
Your only problem is this concrete belief in the existence of a problem, largely created by a misinformed intent to “control” thoughts - something that is not possible. There’s also a degree of magnetism with severe OCD. Those with severe OCD are generally more comfortable having problems than being problem-free.

367,"Every now and then, we have to go through certain ups and downs in life. People hurt, spouse fights, kids don’t listen, boss gets angry, you suffer from sickness or whatever the case may be, you start getting depressed. There is no way to get rid of sadness completely. However, there are certain sure shot ways of lifting up your mood.
1. Get Adequate Sleep:
Get enough sleep and it will alleviate your mood. Studies have shown that sleep and mood are very closely related to each other. People who get a good sleep every night tend to overcome sadness more easily as compared to those who are deprived of sleep.
2.Use Light Therapy:
Exposure to morning light helps cope with anxiety and depression. Wake up a bit earlier and try to get some of it. You will get enough strength to cope up with the daily stress-provoking situations.
3.Stop Blaming Yourself:
If something went wrong, don’t blame yourself over and over again. If it was your fault, make practical steps to correct it, and never repeat in future. And if it wasn’t your fault, just stop blaming yourself and be an optimistic person.
4. Forgive Others:
We live by holding bitterness in our hearts for those who wronged us. This does no harm to them but to ourselves only. Ever thought, “Why am I allowing them to rule over my life?” Relieve yourself of stress by forgiving others.
5.Get Up:
Depression makes you dull. Get rid of it by getting up and indulging yourself in some physical activity. It can be anything. Go for a walk, play with your pet animal, engage yourself with kids, exercise etc. your level of energy will boost up and you would feel positive change in your mood.
6. Stop Comparing:
If you are upset because someone else is doing far better than you are, then stop it. To lead a peaceful life, you need to stop comparing yourself to others.
7. Have Faith in Your Abilities:
Don’t underestimate your abilities. You have to have faith in yourself. Work hard to achieve your goals. If you are feeling depressed, just remind yourself of your achievements in the past and regain your confidence.
8. Don’t Disconnect From Your Loved Ones:
Even if you feel like going into isolation, don’t do it. Remain connected to your loved ones. They care for you. Your negative thoughts might force you to think opposite, but just ignore them. Don’t listen to yourself when you are feeling depressed. Instead, share your thoughts with those who are connected to you by heart. It will lift your spirit.
9. Put Things in Order:
Sometimes it is the mess around us that brings about negative changes in our mood. A neat and organized environment can help you feel better. Try it out. Clean your room, put things in order and experience the difference.
10. Enjoy Natural Beauty:
Exposure to natural beauty not only reduces stress, it also improves your mood in an amazing way. Break your routine, take a day off from your job and enjoy some moments with the Mother Nature.",OCD

369,"This is really not an easy question and there is really no short and sweet answer for it either. Depression is tough. Been there done that. Personally, I believe the root of Depression is spiritual in nature. Obviously, there can be natural causes like hormonal or dietary imbalances, which ought to be ruled out first. Get a proper medical check to see if your chemicals and hormones and nutrients are in sync.
You may be naturally prone to anxiety and responding in an anxious manner to life events and circumstances. In this instance, medical intervention could be useful but not in isolation. Cognitive behaviour therapy or even neurolinguistic therapy will add value. If you feel more comfortable with a traditional psychologist or psychotherapist, then make use of their services.
I had depression and I wasn’t actually aware of it. It seems like it creeps up on a person. However, that simply is not true. It is easy to misunderstand depression or even camouflage what you feel. Worse, you can substitute what you feel. My depression was as a result of infant sexual abuse and a disastrous home life. My parents were non-funtional. Really. I had no idea who I was or why I was here or even how life is meant to function. I could flush a loo and brush my teeth and make food and relate and communicate, but that certainly does not equate to life. I felt lost and abandoned and exposed and even at that young age, immersed myself in being occupied all the time. I read relentlessly and did every kind of sport and cultural activity at school imaginable or available. I was a home slave having to cook, wash, clean, iron and look after my siblings from about the age of 4. I was physically abused and battered by my Mother for many years. I had to deal with her insecurities and demons which was frightening to say the least. I was drowning in all the mayhem.
And that’s just a very small part of events that rooted my depression. By the age of 16 I was in a deep dark pit that eventually lead to a few suicide attempts. And it laster for most of my adult life in spite of loads of intervention. I was never keen on medication but in hindsight, I realise that was a mistake. I did the psychology thing and it left me feeling nothing less than disappointed. You are a talk junkie and they are a listen junkie and if you are a bit smart, you can beat their book. Play them at their own game. Futile I felt. Not a once-off experience either. Quite frankly, they haven’t been in our shoes so how can they tell us what to do? My depression became my way of life. The black dog they call it. I didn’t know how to deal with it or how to get better. Nothing seemed to offer the relief I hoped it would.
No amount of talking, no amount of listening. New experiences had a short term feel the elated effect and being a work addict helped me some. I became a born again Christian and over a period of many years of intensive and persistent meditation, I am free. God does miracles and wonders, but sometimes there are just too much that needs undoing all at once. All the things that happened to me transpired over many years. It had to be picked off one thing at a time, layer by layer. I studied a lot and threw myself into enlightening teaching. At times I would get angry and at times I would get despondent. How could I still be experiencing depression? How could I still feel so suicidal?
And then one day, after dealing internally, day by day, with major issues and working through them, amidst living a normal everyday life, the shackles were loosed and I was free. Today I have a fresh perspective on life and death and how to choose life over death. It has been a long search for my freedom but I found it. Don’t ever quit. There is nothing quite as beautiful as the light at the end of the tunnel!",OCD

371,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

372,"Well, first off, society and its stigma can start off by stop calling it an illness. Why? Because illness is a medical concept that a person is sick or diseased. That is what Psychiatry is all about.
Psychology on the other hand is not out to mask Mental Illness, our focus is strictly on Mental Health.
Allow me to start off by explaining a few truths about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It is not a hereditary disorder, it is not a genetic disorder, and no one is born with OCD. People develop them. I do not care what you have read or been told. Most disorders that are not genetic are cause and effect related.
Which means something happened to created the disorder, so if anything OCD is more of a phobia related disorder but instead of instilling a fear factor reaction, they replace it with a physical behavioral action such as nail biting, hand washing, counting, precision organizing. It also can be a developed byproduct from having a genetic disorder such as Bipolar Disorder and that is because those with Bipolar live a life of constant streaming and racing thoughts that are far greater and faster than the ordinary person’s thought process, so, they develop some OCD behaviors to act as anchors to help them focus. Yet again, it develops, it doesn’t start off right away in their early upbringing. In fact Bipolar is rarely diagnosed in youth. Why? Because the body does not fully mature until approximately the age 25 when the skeleton stops growing which means, that is when the brain finally settles into the cranial cavity and completes its growth/maturity process. One of the reasons I strongly advocate against drug therapy for children, teenagers and young adults. Use therapy until their brain matures fully and then reassess them.
I digress, most OCD is usually because of some trauma related incident that gets bottled up, and the person refuses to properly come to terms with the event or the aftermath of the event. Thus it festers and builds and becomes a noticeable physical manifestation.
Drug therapy is NOT the answer, all that does is numb the sensory responses with reuptake inhibitors and other such chemicals tricks in the bag, including anti psychotic medication such as Seroquel. The zombie drug. (not really, but many claim they feel like the walking undead).
Not even Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is the best tool in the toolbox for therapists. Good therapists need to be creative and have the ability to customize a unique therapy for each and every client. Why? Because humans and their disorders are not cookie cut according to their symptoms and come off a conveyor belt assembly line. That’s what Psychiatry would have you think, that they can break down a person by symptoms and put a label on it. It just does not work that way. They are medical doctors, they think like medical doctors, they do not have the broad fields of sanctioned fields of education that Psychology does. In truth here are some interesting fun facts.
1: A medical doctor (MD) technically does not have a Doctorate degree and yet they are called Doctors. The most common Doctorate degree is a PhD which translates into Doctor of Philosophy of (what ever field), which means they have put in the extra academic initiative to earn a PhD which means a Doctorate allowing one to research. Thus, any Medical Doctor who wants to earn a degree to do research has to go back to university/college and earn a PhD in a specific field of science such as Biology, Neuroscience, Surgery, and so on. Then they can become specialists.
2: Psychiatry? No, they are just medical doctors and after they have done a couple of years of private medical practice, they just read some material and then take a one day three part exam, oral, written and practicum. If they pass, they they are certified as Psychiatrists. Yes, they are still Doctors by rote, but here is the weird thing. They must give up their license to practice as a Medical Doctor.
3: If a Psychiatrist wants a PhD, then (wait for it) he has to complete and undergraduate program and earn a Bachelors or a Masters if they are willing and then they have to get a clinical PhD in Psychology, but they rarely wish to admit it. Most just choose to not go into Psychology and instead take a PhD in Neuroscience or something similar, but they unless they get a PhD in Psychology, they have no actual authority to do research in the human psyche and behavior.
Which means, since they do not, most of what they are stating is pure theory or is pure, well, you will have to excuse my French, Bullshit.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be actually cured without drug therapy, by an elite Psychological therapist. All that is necessary is to identify the root cause of the reason, and once that is established, then it can be brought out of the root cellar into the light and vanquished. It all comes down to the ability of the client to accept.",OCD

After the heavy and mostly cloudy monsoon and now a foggy winter this year you may have grown deficient with Vitamin D3 (lack of sunlight) which may have further aggravated your mental health. Which also leads you aggressive and irritability initially on depleting levels. Having too much synthetic sugar, excessive meat, heavy protein diet, too much caffeine, excessive alcohol, excessive smoking leads to irritability and aggressive behaviors too.

Meditation can do wonders. If you are suffering from OCD of say, anything; you can easily get rid of it in 15 minutes just as I said already.
What you need to do is:
Go to any place of peace. CHURCH/TEMPLE/MOSQUE/GURDWARA are all very good but believe me, your room is the best place.
Start with “om”( like ooooooooom) for first 2 minutes.
Now just tell your brain that you have decided to get over your compulsions.
Think about the thing/person/thought/object.
Keep exploring it.
It won't be long before you start realising that you yourself are more important than that object.
That, you deserve more as you soar higher into your inner self and that that thing/object/thought is imperfect and has quite low value in your life and that you have higher priorities ;however it is not bad. Still not good, not the best .
End it all with 30 seconds of “oooom”(rhymes with dome not doom).
This all will not take more than 15 minutes.
And when you get up, you will realise that you are someone better than before and that you are ready to avoid the compulsion.
Sounds very simple, isn't it, you may think it might have only a little credibility . Simplicity has its own highs first of all. Secondly, try it and you will surely reach there.

377,"Even though I came to know about the exact term used for it very late in my life, I can remember having OCD from an early age. So I don't think something triggers OCD in general cases, it's just the way few people are.
In my particular case, I have a good control over my urges which comes with OCD, and I just feel lucky to not have a severe case of OCD. I just want things around me to be clean organized in some situations, suddenly I feel like washing my hands and legs, or having to do certain things exact number of times for it to feel correct. Only the last one irritates me a little, and can be awkward in some cases.
But if you agree that it's a problem you have to fix, and try fighting that urge even if doesn't feel right, and even you have to do it after few hours to stop that war going on in your head, eventually it gets better.
In case of severe OCD, please consult an doctor they can reduce the symptoms.",OCD
378,"OCD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, is a condition that generates unwanted thoughts and anxieties. It is tough to control, and regrettably, you are constantly criticized for things that you cannot control. It disrupts your regular responsibilities at school and work since you may have to get up every ten minutes to wash your hands, even if they are not filthy. Your coworkers and classmates may notice this conduct, and you may stick out like a sore thumb. The best approach to manage it is to seek treatment from an OCD therapist.",OCD
379,"Now see that is a great question! Not easy to answer, but I will try to the best of my ability. Personally, I have different forms of ocd anxiety. I have the organization one where my colors have to be in the right order or the desks have to be just right but if that doesn't happen, I just put my music on and tune it out. It doesn't always work but majority of the time it distracts my mind. This might be because I also have ADHD.
Now see with spelling, I am a spelling freak. If I know for a fact something is spelled wrong or I have that gut instinct, my brain will not leave me alone until I fix it or correct it. I've personally dealt with this by hanging out with people who have bad spelling skills so it's become easier over time.
And believe it or not, overthinking can be a form of ocd. Those what if situations that won't leave you alone until it finishes the story which could last for days, weeks, or even months on end and maybe repeat themselves? Yeah that's ocd. I personally again turn my music on to tune them out. Music has helped me so much in my life.

In fact,Whenever I think about past 7 years since my OCD started, i cant control my tears to roll out from my eyes, just because that life was like a hell .

Yes!it is a serious diaorder if not treated early and properly.
No! it is not a serious disorder provided you recognize it early and start taking behavioural therapy or medication at the earliest.
Do remember, OCD treatment is long and usually need professional help.
Good luck.",OCD
382,"Yes. Clinically diagnosed OCD can be quite debilitating.
I have a relative who is diagnosed with OCD and is on medication. Without the medicines he finds it really difficult to go about his daily activities. OCD manifests as different compulsions in different individuals. Some might be simple such as a compulsion to wash your hands every 5 minutes. This might seem ‘not so serious’ but imagine an irresitable urge to wash your hand inbetween your everyday activities and it can get so bad that the skin of your hands can peel off and become infected. The compulsions might even be to do harmful things.
So yes it can be a serious disease. But almost everyone has a tiny bit of OCD in them! Maybe like a compulsion to have the volume at levels of even numbers, or to arrange your pens/books by colour, these are not debilitating. But people with serious OCD shouldn’t be looked down on or made fun of. The compulsive urges cannot be controlled by him/her.

383,"No, it is not a permanent mental disorder.

OCD is curable but very difficult to cure. It can be Rejuvenated by alternative method of healing without any medicine.

384,"Pretty good question but it's answer is quite simple. OCD(obsessive compulsive disorder) is where a sufferer has irrational obsession which he has to do in form of a compulsive task(need not always be physical) to reassure himself and rid him of the particular obsession(temporarily unfortunately!). So as you wouldd have guessed by now,OCD is obsession to do compulsion and not the other way round.hope that helps.",OCD

Or the fact that you have your cupboards organised just so and it drives you nuts when someone puts something in the wrong place.
If you have to check you locked the door three times, that's still not OCD.
It's a little bit like OCD.
OCD is a mental illness because people who suffer from it are unable to lead a normal life as a consequence.
Their OCD may mean that they have to keep everything extra clean. That the skin on their hands is raw from washing and their flat smells of bleach and they still think everything is filthy and it causes them extreme anxiety.
Or they have repeated obtrusive thoughts they can't control and can't stop. They can do certain tasks to lessen them, like counting but that can take a long time and will get in the way of normal life.
If something unpredictable happens, they'd often blame themselves and have to punish themselves for not doing the routines that could have prevented this properly and will have to do more of these routines because of that. It's a vicious circle that does not get better.
They know it is irrational. They know it but they can't stop. And that makes it an illness.",OCD
386,"OCD is by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and is most certainly debilitating. OCD isn't wanting to have tables lined up straight. It isn't wanting your pens in colour order. It isn't wanting to have a tidy room. OCD is a debilitating disorder that can take over your life, and is incredibly difficult to recover from.
OCD can manifest itself in so many ways, but it usually revolves around a set of phobias, or obsessions, that usually have a common factor. For me I feel the need to have control over every aspect of my environment in order to keep myself safe. I'm terrified of germs, bugs, and anything where I'm out of control or not myself, such as alcohol or carnival rides. Contact with any of these things used to make me feel overwhelmingly panicked.
It's not simply a matter of having a few phobias and avoiding them. They're called obsessions for a reason. You spend hours of your day thinking about how to avoid every thing that you obsess about. Then the compulsive side comes in. If you come into contact with any of these things that worry you, you then have to something to advert the danger you think you have put yourself in. It's not a choice, in your head it's a matter of life and death, removing this danger is necessary.
By giving into the compulsion you continue the cycle, where the only thing that help a certain obsession is to give into the compulsion. It's incredibly overwhelming, spending hours thinking about how to avoid a certain thing, going out of your way to avoid said thing, then when you inevitably come into contact with it having to do something awful to get rid of the panic.
For me my main obsession was germs. I had to about them at all costs. Otherwise I'd get sick and die. I'd only eat from dishes that had been washed in the dishwasher, because the sink water was filthy. I'd hold glasses up to the light to make sure they were clean. I'd get new cutlery if mine touched the table. I'd refuse to use my drink bottle ever again if anyone else drank from it. I refuse to swim in anything but the ocean. If anyone touched my toothbrush I'd start crying. I wouldn't hold on on the train, because people's dirty hands had touched the railing, instead I'd lean against the door in everyone's way. I had to make all my food fresh myself, so none of the ingredients were off. If I touched anything that worried me I'd scrub my hands with soap. Eventually my hands were cracked and raw from all the soap. I'd refuse physical contact with people, in case they were sick or hadn't washed their hands. This stuff was just the tip of the iceberg.
The social impact is also devastating, as no one wants to spend time with someone who has such intense anxiety around so much. You also drive your friends away, as you don't think they'd be any help. I know I ended up becoming depressed, feeling like so much was wrong with me and I had no one to go to. I'm a teenage girl, and so far I've never been in a relationship. I've been asked out by people I've liked, and I've wanted to ask people out, but if hugging a family member is worrying because of germs, the thought of kissing someone, let alone going any further is absolutely terrifying.
Then there's recovery. In order to recover from OCD you can have talk therapy or medication, often in combination. I was to scared to go on medication because I thought it might impact my thoughts to much and I'd stop being me. A method called cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT, is often used by psychologists. This basically involves exposing yourself to the exact thing that terrifies you in order to make it stop scaring you. Whatever your worst fear is think of it. Imagine having to expose yourself to it every single day, and feel that overwhelming fear that comes with that phobia in order to get better. Medication can help, but in the end without CBT you won't really get better. It's a horrible experience, trying so hard to go against everything your brain is telling you to do.
If you work incredibly hard eventually it does make a difference. You're less overwhelmed, and actually have the time to think about other things. As hard as CBT is, it certainly helps. But despite the fact it gets better you live in constant fear of relapse, of being miserable again, as without constant effort OCD can creep up on you again. And OCD isn't something you cure. It is something you learn to cope with, and work around in your life. You're not trying to get rid of OCD, sadly that's all but impossible, you're trying to get to a point where it doesn't interfere with your day to day happiness.
I hope from this you can see that despite the lack of obvious physical symptoms OCD is most certainly a debilitating disorder, that is able to seriously damage your way of life. And please, whatever you do, don't use OCD to describe your quirks, don't say you're so OCD about your pencils or your wardrobe. Hearing people describe your disorder as if it's a quirk to laugh about is devastating.",OCD
387,"All mental health problems lie on a range or continuum. Take a simple line numbered from 1 to 10. At 1 a mental disorder is not really a problem. The symptom is just a part of a person's general behaviour and habits that are within the norm. Perhaps it’s what makes that person a bit special or eccentric.
As the severity or incidence of the symptom increases along the scale it becomes more obvious and challenging. It reaches a point at the end of the scale where it is causing the person extreme discomfort, they may have had to abandon working and the family will be in turmoil.
Mild obsessive-compulsive behaviour can be beneficial for some people and they are able to incorporate it into their work or careers. However, at the end of the scale OCD is life-threatening. I had a patient that shouted and punched himself in the head as hard as possible. He would sometimes also bang his head on the wall as part of his compulsive behaviour. It was extremely upsetting to witness his illness. He had to be treated in hospital. Many can’t put up with their own extreme behaviour having lost control of it and suicide. All get depressed.
Severe OCD is a mental illness.
The criterion for a diagnosis of obsessional compulsive disorder hangs on the compulsion to perform a task repetitively and the task or behaviour is damaging to the person either by making them look crazy thus damaging socially or actually injuring themselves as in the example I gave. If a compulsive action leads to better health and well being then it does not fall into the OCD diagnosis.
The other thing about OCD is the powerlessness experienced by the person struggling not to be obsessed and trying to overcome the compulsion to act on the obsession. The last I would I say about this is that much normal behaviour is wrongly attributed to OCD, particularly in the past. Sexual fantasies, masturbation and many sexual activities were thought to be manifestations of OCD but in fact, have been found to be the normal functioning of the human mind and body.",OCD
388,"Can't it be both?
Maybe it depends if you're being OCD deliberately/you're not blindly having compulsions, but more consciously wanting to fuss or do things repeatedly, I would think that's more psychological. For me it feels automatic and like my brain's on auto pilot.",OCD

The word “disease” has a specific meaning within medicine and may involve particular criteria that have to be met for diagnosis.[1]
OCD is considered to be a mental illness.[2] [3] The word “illness” might be more generic than “disease”.
I’m not sure what difference labeling your experience as a disease, disorder, syndrome or condition makes. You don’t feel well and you want the symptoms and their causes to be dealt with. That is the focus that matters most.

391,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

392,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
393,"1) Selecting something you'll be motivated to change: Start with your motivation to waste less time. If you are going to choose a habit to change, Choose the habit that is taking the most time or is otherwise most disruptive to your life, rather than the habit you think you ""should"" change. Focus on modifying just that habit.
2) Making the change: to decrease your unwanted behaviors, you will need to increase your tolerance to your feeling of disgust. One client of mine who was washing hands until they bled, which ironically increased the chance of infection, started staring at her hands, facing the fact that there were germs there, and telling herself it was not possible to remove all germs from our bodies (there are more bacteria in our bodies than there are cells of our own bodies!). She made herself face this rather than trying to remove all germs. A smaller step you can take is to simply delete or shorten the most time-consuming behavior. This will be as difficult as very slowly walking in to cold water at a pool; some people do better with tiny changes, for others this is torture and they need to make bigger changes.
3) Change more of your ""compulsions"" to ""preferences""; you have already begun this with your statement that you prefer to bathe after defecating. By thinking of these as ""preferences,"" you are now more in charge of your actions rather than OCD being in charge of your actions.
I was going to write about OCD more generally in my mental health blog Mental Health Knowledge sometime this month; may I use your example, and also hear what you've tried? We could also talk about it directly online at Helpouts by James Foley, although that's a pain if you don't have a Google account.
One more try at summarizing the approach I'm suggesting for you (based on not knowing your background, style, emotions, etc):
Take charge of whatever habits you want to change, and realize that not giving in to your compulsions will be uncomfortable (for you, that means feeling some disgust), but that's how you know you're doing good work. But first make sure that your desire to change is stronger than your desire to avoid feelings of disgust; you can't do avoidance behaviors and also STOP doing avoidance behaviors. Keep most of your handwashing as preferences, but decide that you are going to do them only when it's a choice.
Good luck!",OCD
394,"OCD means you have fear of thoughts.
To overcome 100% , just understand below things and BOOM, you are free from OCD
No need to stop the negative thoughts.
The more you want to stop it, the more they will come.
“Negative thoughts cannot do anything to your life“ , Believe me.
So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Thoughts cannot do anything.”
Just focus on taking positive actions only.
Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.
So focus on taking positive actions only.",OCD
395,"First calm yourself!
See ocd is a mental disorder in which we find things to be perfect and any thought that realizes us that it gonna harm in future or it is not the right way to do things you can do better etc will create anxiety. There are some measures you can do to relax yourself while ocd in long term.
When a thought come to you that you have done this thing wrong or you haven't check it right go and check again then don't go for any compulsions just stay and think what happened if I will not do it can actually something happen . Think consciously and leave the rest. I know there is some anxiety happens here but don't worry next time you will feel less anxiety about it.
Don't do compulsions in repetitive manner just distract your mind in other things
Try cognitive behavioral therapy
Accept that you can't do things perfectly and if something remain disturbed then leave it don't manage them.
Accept that you have ocd and when any compulsive thought come across your mind revise your mind that it is ocd thought and the mind is lying to you.
Studies shows that ocd thoughts are almost 100 % false they are not exist in this real world. And what you are thinking is not going to happen ever.
Never feel lonely this beautiful world ,nature ,universe is with you.
Connect with nature and make yourself busy in positive and creative things that you enjoy.
Talk to friends and family members.
You have alot of potential and strength and you can live your best life so go for it!

396,"Well, first off, society and its stigma can start off by stop calling it an illness. Why? Because illness is a medical concept that a person is sick or diseased. That is what Psychiatry is all about.
Psychology on the other hand is not out to mask Mental Illness, our focus is strictly on Mental Health.
Allow me to start off by explaining a few truths about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It is not a hereditary disorder, it is not a genetic disorder, and no one is born with OCD. People develop them. I do not care what you have read or been told. Most disorders that are not genetic are cause and effect related.
Which means something happened to created the disorder, so if anything OCD is more of a phobia related disorder but instead of instilling a fear factor reaction, they replace it with a physical behavioral action such as nail biting, hand washing, counting, precision organizing. It also can be a developed byproduct from having a genetic disorder such as Bipolar Disorder and that is because those with Bipolar live a life of constant streaming and racing thoughts that are far greater and faster than the ordinary person’s thought process, so, they develop some OCD behaviors to act as anchors to help them focus. Yet again, it develops, it doesn’t start off right away in their early upbringing. In fact Bipolar is rarely diagnosed in youth. Why? Because the body does not fully mature until approximately the age 25 when the skeleton stops growing which means, that is when the brain finally settles into the cranial cavity and completes its growth/maturity process. One of the reasons I strongly advocate against drug therapy for children, teenagers and young adults. Use therapy until their brain matures fully and then reassess them.
I digress, most OCD is usually because of some trauma related incident that gets bottled up, and the person refuses to properly come to terms with the event or the aftermath of the event. Thus it festers and builds and becomes a noticeable physical manifestation.
Drug therapy is NOT the answer, all that does is numb the sensory responses with reuptake inhibitors and other such chemicals tricks in the bag, including anti psychotic medication such as Seroquel. The zombie drug. (not really, but many claim they feel like the walking undead).
Not even Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is the best tool in the toolbox for therapists. Good therapists need to be creative and have the ability to customize a unique therapy for each and every client. Why? Because humans and their disorders are not cookie cut according to their symptoms and come off a conveyor belt assembly line. That’s what Psychiatry would have you think, that they can break down a person by symptoms and put a label on it. It just does not work that way. They are medical doctors, they think like medical doctors, they do not have the broad fields of sanctioned fields of education that Psychology does. In truth here are some interesting fun facts.
1: A medical doctor (MD) technically does not have a Doctorate degree and yet they are called Doctors. The most common Doctorate degree is a PhD which translates into Doctor of Philosophy of (what ever field), which means they have put in the extra academic initiative to earn a PhD which means a Doctorate allowing one to research. Thus, any Medical Doctor who wants to earn a degree to do research has to go back to university/college and earn a PhD in a specific field of science such as Biology, Neuroscience, Surgery, and so on. Then they can become specialists.
2: Psychiatry? No, they are just medical doctors and after they have done a couple of years of private medical practice, they just read some material and then take a one day three part exam, oral, written and practicum. If they pass, they they are certified as Psychiatrists. Yes, they are still Doctors by rote, but here is the weird thing. They must give up their license to practice as a Medical Doctor.
3: If a Psychiatrist wants a PhD, then (wait for it) he has to complete and undergraduate program and earn a Bachelors or a Masters if they are willing and then they have to get a clinical PhD in Psychology, but they rarely wish to admit it. Most just choose to not go into Psychology and instead take a PhD in Neuroscience or something similar, but they unless they get a PhD in Psychology, they have no actual authority to do research in the human psyche and behavior.
Which means, since they do not, most of what they are stating is pure theory or is pure, well, you will have to excuse my French, Bullshit.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be actually cured without drug therapy, by an elite Psychological therapist. All that is necessary is to identify the root cause of the reason, and once that is established, then it can be brought out of the root cellar into the light and vanquished. It all comes down to the ability of the client to accept.",OCD
397,"I wake up at the same time I do every morning, and make sure I blink exactly ten times before getting out of bed.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay, I’m good. Everything’s good.
I get up, walking to the kitchen (left, right, of course I have to keep track) and pour myself a bowl of cereal. Always tap the side of the box three times before opening it. Then I finish getting ready in the exact right order. No brushing my teeth before getting dressed. No brushing my hair before I eat. Then, I walk to the bus stop. Make sure not to step on any cracks in the road on the way. Wait for a few minutes for the bus to come, repeatedly making sure I have my phone and wallet every thirty seconds or so.
Once I’m on the bus, I make sure the moment I sit down that my phone, wallet, and bus pass are still there. My phone is always in my left pocket and my wallet and bus pass are always in my right. Why do I check? Is it because I’m afraid someone stole them, or that they fell out of my pockets, or that I forgot them at home even though I know that they’re there because I’ve already checked a half dozen times since walking out the door?
Yes. All of those reasons, no matter how irrational I know they are.
Try not to draw attention to my leg bouncing up and down, especially if there’s someone sitting beside me. Oh god, they noticed, they think I’m weird and that I’m a freak oh my god oh my god…
This is the first hour of my day, every day. School can be much worse.
I’m not medicated. I don’t get to go to therapy. I can’t even get my dad to believe that OCD is real and that my problems are genuine. The only way that I cope with OCD is support from (some) amazing friends and breathing exercises I learned in yoga that are supposed to help you relax. Believe me, I wish there was a way to cope better with my OCD.",OCD
398,"For me the key to recovery was learning to label my intrusive thoughts, feelings and sensations. No matter how real they feel I just tell myself, ""Nope. This is an OCD thing and I know how this ends."" I do not push the thoughts away...I simply choose not to waste anymore than 2 seconds trying to figure them out.(Why am I having this thought? What does this mean? What does this say about me? Could it be true? What if? What if? What if?). Historically, me trying to answer these questions have in no way provided me with any kind of long term relief. Short term? Yes. Long term. Never. I simply choose not to engage. I observe the thought, feeling or sensation. I label it as OCD then I refocus on more important things. By the way...literally anything is more important than engaging with your OCD. As time goes on you start to see the change. Before you know it, days will have gone by and you'll think, ""Wow! I haven't thought about XYZ in a minute"", and you'll slowly start becoming more productive, stress free, and engaged. You just have to trust the process and STICK WITH IT. You may still have the thoughts, and depending on a particular obsessions impact on your life...you'll likely have them until the day you die. But you'll no longer find them distressing in the way that they use to be, and your perspective regarding them will have vastly changed...I am in OCD remission, and my life is amazing.",OCD
399,"How do obsessions occur? Why do they become compulsive?
Each action in our body on completion receives an acknowledgment from the performing organ through the neural network. Millions of such transactions occur. Each of our thoughts get converted into actions. If the acknowledgment is not received by the brain, it initiates the action again. Due to lack of neurotransmitters sometimes the actions do not pass a completion signal to the brain. The actions get performed several times and the brain continues to believe that the action was not performed. The brain gets into a repetitive loop.
If this happens for multiple thoughts the brain function can become extremely confused and stressed.
So yes OCD thoughts will eventually lead to panic and anxiety attacks if not treated.
Did you know that OCD behavior (more profound aftereffect depression) occurs due to lack of protein synthesis by the guts (stomach). The body needs amines, vitamins amino acids to produce serotonin. This in turn increases the neurotransmitter levels.
Serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (medication) can accelerate to reach required levels (at least a year) as the absorption is extremely slow naturally. After a year you can distinctly tell between the quality of thoughts before and after.
Once you bring these levels to normal you would have gotten rid of both your OCD, anxiety and depression.
Hope that helps.",OCD
400,"What an interesting question. Why would you think people living with any type of mental illness would be the hardest people to love?
People with the lived experience of mental illness are human beings, just like you and I. They have feelings. They have emotions. They have the brains that the universe gave to them. They have families. They have hopefully meaningful work. They can and do contribute to their communities, in ways you would be incredibly surprised at. They have hopes and dreams. They can and do accomplish many things in their lives. They also like every other human being on the planet have challenges they have to negotiate and overcome.
Hence, maybe your question could potentially be: are people living with mental illness so caring towards others that others fail to see the light that shines within them? A light that can guide and lead the way for others to understand that living with mental illness is not a crime. A light that shines - hopes and dreams can indeed come true. A light that comes from within and extends outwards so others can see that living with a mental illness is not the sum total of the person, and is only a small portion of that person’s life. A light that can indeed touch others with the caring, support and understanding of knowing what it is indeed like to live with a mental illness and have talents, skills and expertise to create opportunities not only for themselves but for those around them.
Hope this assists.",OCD
401,"Probably not. Bipolar people are hard to keep in a sustained relationship because you never know what to expect: for a friend, their mood appears to be random and if one day they like you and the next everything is in question, it is hard to keep up, even if you know it is not their fault.
Similarly, extreme narcissism can exhaust a friend (me, me, me, I am the best and you are dirt under my feet), it takes a firm resolution to keep friendship alive – although I must say some people never see how unpleasant the person is).",OCD
402,"I often find that persons with BPD have an almost irresistible attraction about them, almost as if they were made of warm puppy-dog eyes, angel feathers, and cotton candy. It has left me convinced that there is some spiritual dimension to BPD, and I have been trying to assemble an idea of what it could possibly be. To do that, however, I realize I will have to transcend the 20th century notion of science as “objective,” which certainly limits the ideas we can explore. It is easy to develop an immediate strong bond of attachment to a person with BPD. There is, however, another side to this.
Love is one thing, but relationship is another thing altogether. There are certain features of the disorder that makes relationships a big challenge - features such as mood swings, being very easily wounded, and fear of abandonment make such a relationship into a rocky road.

403,"People with BPD are easy to love.
When they love, they love fiercely and intensely. There is an ability that they have that allows them to make the other person feel both wanted and needed, and worthy of the desire.If you think about it, this totally makes sense because the individual with Borderline Personality is on a constant search for love.
Where it can become an issue is when the expectations from the individual become too much, or when they are triggered by abandonment. That is when it may become more difficult to love them.",OCD
404,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

405,Yes. You have to accept that the mental illness will affect the person and the relationship. My mother suffers from ocd so i can understand how it affects my parents’ relationship.,OCD
406,"Of course you can fall in “love”
Probably not the sacrificial, provide, be there, build a future, and if it comes down to it die, like you would for your child
Probably not building an incredibly deep bond, true partnership, deepest levels of trust, self sacrificing and being best friends, lovers, and soul mates like in a true marriage.
But you can certainly have strong emotional feelings or a desire to rescue that you call love.
You can crave and have sex to “take away the pain of the world"" and call it love.
You can have a sordid time where the one with untreated mental illness wreaks total havoc and a trauma bond is formed, or if the one without mental illness stays long enough they can get PTSD…and call it love
Truth be told, I truly thought I “loved” my BPD Wife, but actually had no trust in her, believed little or nothing of what she said, knew I could not count on her in time of crisis or pretty much any other time, but I craved and was addicted to her touch and how she could make me feel.
At times I strongly disliked her and despised her “fatherless adult children” that I allowed myself into being duped to helping financially.
And as a pw/BPD with narcissistic tendencies she had no love for me.
We were married, said “I love you” many times a day, but now with psych meds and therapy realize there was no “love” in our marriage, just strong emotions
As for the original question, especially if the mentally ill one remains untreated, there can be strong emotions that you delude yourself is love > but no real love",OCD
407,"Most people I meet immediately like me and treat me with kid gloves. They sense the damaged little girl and want to pick her up and make her better.

Sometimes they have emotional issues too and I’m company for their misery. If they are a rescuer who likes to feel needed and wanted, I check every box.
So, I make friends and protectors very easily. How many are there a year or two later? Eh..1/10 maybe.
Borderlines are super easy to love because we ADORE YOU! :D You make us feel great and we’ll make you feel great. You’ll be adored, admired, fawned over, loved, loved, loved! The problem is, after a while, you’ll inevitably reveal yourself as an ordinary flawed human being. Then it’s not so much fun. We have illusions about your perfection and we’ll mourn the loss of that ideal, trust me. We’ll scream and cry because you bought the wrong brand of mustard - and how could you not know??

408,"Not being able to act on your OCD is actually one of the ways you treat it. My specific diagnosis manifests as dermatillomania and sometimes manic attachments to others. The manic attachments thing is more complicated and heartbreaking to deal with, so let’s focus on the dermatillomania!
Dermatillomania means that when I see inconsistencies in my skin, I pick at it. Acne and ingrown hairs are the worst, but on a bad occasion I will even go after freckles. For me it’s a fear of contamination and sickness being trapped just beneath my skin. A zit, to me, is a pocket of pus that MUST be drained or it will get worse. An ingrown hair is a tension blister waiting to happen.
I couldn’t leave these things be. In college I would occasionally miss meetings and classes because I found a zit and I was convinced I was dying and if I didn’t clear it out it would get worse. On some level I knew this wasn’t right, but that was on a high functioning level. On a basic one, a primitive one, I could not be convinced otherwise. I have scars across my back from gouging holes in it to get rid of acne. My neck is similarly covered in white spots.
When I first started therapy specifically for my dermatillomania, it was torture. It literally involved me sitting down when the urge hit, and not doing a thing. The best way I can explain t is like you are sitting in a room, and smoke is funneling in under the door, and you can smell fire, and yet you do nothing to respond. That’s how it feels internally to not respond to your specific issue.
After several years of therapy, I can now say that at this point it’s more of an annoyance. I still have issues with zits and ingrown hairs, but now it’s more like knowing that the smoke is just a bad smell and there is no fire. Like you still want to address it, but you can tolerate it for a bit while you wrap up work.
When you have no therapy or coping mechanisms for your ocd, not giving in to the compulsion is torture, with a lot of work, it becomes an annoyance not to give in.",OCD

I can't just ""get over it.""
Not easily, anyway. I can't wake up one day and say ""y'know what? No more OCD for me!"" If it was that easy, I would have done that years ago!
That I feel guilty for involving them.
I hate saying it, but some family members are involved in some of my rituals. Before someone leaves, I say ""Have a good day"", ""I love you"", and then ""Be careful."" It has to be in that order. ""I love you"" CANNOT be the last thing said. I feel that if that's the last thing said, I'll never see them again. ""Be careful"" HAS to be the last thing said so that they'll be safer (or that's what my mind tells me anyway). If they go out of order, I have to start over.
I feel controlling. I hate it.",OCD
410,"Its a good question. The proper therapy for OCD is CBT therapy with exposure and response prevention. Its the only therapy that is proven to manage OCD. You shouldnt go into therapy looking for the therapist to get rid of your OCD. With this therapy you will learn the tools to take your recovery as far as you want to. Over time and after you and your therapist agree that you are on the right track based on how well you understand and perform the therapy you can likely go it alone and keep up the good work reaping the dividends along the way. I was in therapy once a week for about a year before going it alone. This is not to say that it couldn't be done on your own without a therapist but its more than likely you will fail.
OCD is tricky because it will throw you all kinds of curve balls that can derail your progress and without someone there to help you put things in proper perspective I fear could cause you to give up on it.
I will explain the therapy. First of all it's important to know exactly what is happening. With OCD you have a primal part of your brain which sends you warnings of anxiety when it believes you are in danger. Unfortunately with OCD the warnings sent are a mistake. Your amygdala is misfiring marrying up certain thoughts as a danger to you when they are not. People with OCD know on some level that these thoughts are bullshit yet this understanding doesn't stop the torture your brain is sending you. The thoughts trigger anxiety even if you know its BS. It cannot be reasoned with.
Before therapy to manage the pain most sufferers will perform all kinds of avoidance tactics. They will seek reassurances from others that they are not what these thoughts are saying about them. They will perform silly rituals that they believe will help keep them safe. They will ruminate all day long trying to find an answer which will never come. Some of these might ring a bell with you.
The illness is based on a lie. So how do you get your amygdala to leave you alone? It starts with acceptance. First you will need to accept that this is what is happening and because you know its phony you are not going to placate it by practicing avoidance and performing rituals. You will have to accept the pain being sent to you as irrelevant without fighting it. When you engage in relief seeking behaviors you are feeding the illness ending up making it stronger. The way your amygdala learns is not from talk but rather by your behaviors. If you show it that you are terrified by performing rituals it will learn that it is correct in sending out the anxiety spikes whenever these thoughts appear. Its really acting as your best friend trying to protect you.
After accepting the reality of whats going on in your brain by not reacting to your OCD improperly you will start showing your brain that you are not afraid by doing exposures designed to show your amygdala that not only are you not going to react to these with relief seeking behaviors you are going to prove to it that you are not afraid by exposing yourself to these fears on purpose. Scary stuff but it works. Your therapist will likely give you homework assignments to do several times daily where you perform these exposures. There is a couple ways to do exposures. One is flooding where you basically lock yourself in a phone booth with all your fears without looking for any escape. I dont recommend this technique as it could cause you to give up. I think its best to gradually expose yourself to your fears from least bothersome and working yourself up to the most frightening ones. It's important to do these several times a day and never seek relief from the pain they might cause. I used to thank my amygdala for warning me with an anxiety spike but then quickly show it that I was not afraid of these thoughts by performing an exposure to show it that I am not only not afraid of them but I am okay with them and even welcome them.
It wont take very long doing correctly where the frequency of the anxiety spikes slows down but not completely go away. Its kind of the law of diminishing returns where you will see great progress pretty early on but to fully get past it will take much longer. You can take it as far as you want to.
Its been said by many that you can't cure OCD you can only manage it. I have to call BS on that one. If you learn to accept it and always run towards it with exposures instead of away from it and seeking relief you can take your recovery as far as you want to.The goal of therapy is not to get rid of your OCD but rather get to the point where these thoughts dont trigger anxiety anymore. This is habituation. Those without an anxiety disorder has had all the same painful thoughts you are having but they are able to dismiss them easily without a second thought. You can get to the same place.",OCD
411,"I will be full HONEST with you.
When I was suffering from OCD, people said to talk to a therapist. BUT, my main concerns with the therapies are that in their session they will tell you to accept the thoughts rather than repel them and they will also tell that there is no 100% cure for OCD and you have to live with that.
First of all, why will I accept something bad? What if you are getting thoughts that your father is a killer, then what will you do? These so-called therapies are just from the root of one belief only. That is why OCD patients need effective cure rather than getting shoved up what the others want you to think.
So, in this fight with OCD, you should learn to fight against it yourself but you should talk to someone first who can guide you correctly. Then from there, the whole process will begin.

413,"I suffered from OCD for four years of my life. But, now it’s quite hard to believe that as I don’t have it anymore in my life. I can remember my OCD symtomps as ealry as when I was 13 or 14 years old. It wastes a lot of your time and suck up most of your energy. The anxiety, the intense urge to perform certain action in a certain way - it was bad. But, I have never been to a psychologist for a diagnosis or took meds. For a long time I didn’t even know what it actually is.
What helped me is - awareness and full knowledge about my condition. I can’t count how many web pages I visited to understand OCD. I stuffed my mind with coping strategies and OCD related information - this is the most important part - so everytime I performed my rituals my mind would interrupt and say, Dude! What the hell are you doing?
I understood my obsessions and compulsions and observed them. Sometimes it’s quite funny what absense or inadquacey of certain chemical do to our behaviour. However, it takes time. I came to know about my OCD 5 years ago and I am completely normal from last one year or so. RIght now I am 20 and I have already started to forgot what OCD feel like.
Self help is the best way to treat yourself if your symtomps are not severe. List your obsessions and observe your compulsions and if possible, laugh at them. You can find a tonn of stuff on Internet that can help you learn to cope with your obsessions and compulsions. Be consistent while improving yourself and never give up. It will take quite a lot time but one day OCD will be out of your life.
Hope this helps.",OCD
414,"Generally, Cognitive Behaviour therapies (CBT) for OCD are exposure based. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the recommended CBT treatment for OCD. The treatment generally involves a therapist guiding a person with OCD to expose themselves, in a graded way, to the anxiety and discomfort associated with their obsessions WITHOUT acting on them. So if a person with contamination-fear based OCD is having an urge to wash their hands, they refrain COMPLETELY from doing so and instead sit with the discomfort and anxiety. The therapist VERY IMPORTANTLY also guides the person to block all other substitute behaviours that they might feel the urge to do when they are refraining from hand-washing. If this is not done, the treatment will not be successful. Through repeating the above process many many times, the person’s anxiety and discomfort gradually comes down substantially along with their urges to perform their compulsive physical or mental behaviours. The person learns that the catastrophic outcome that they fear could occur either doesn't occur or is very unlikely.
As you can probably imagine, the exposure treatment is no easy feat as the person with OCD has to be willing and FULLY committed to face the anxiety and discomfort that comes with not acting on their obsessions, and they must be willing to refrain from their compulsive behaviours, whether this is handwashing or repeatedly mentally counting to 10. If the person is not able or willing to make this commitment then therapy will most likely be terminated.
There are self-help books available to support people with OCD to treat themselves but these will only be helpful if the person is extremely commuted and motivated to refrain from acting on their obsessions. Also because new and sometimes very subtle compulsive behaviours show up when a person refrains from engaging in one compulsive behaviour, having a therapist is sometimes necessary. OCD exposure treatment only works when ALL compulsive behaviours are blocked.",OCD
415,"I will base my answer on a previous answer I wrote. The main evidence based treatment is Exposure Therapy (ET) with Response Prevention (RP).
In a very simplified way it has been found that OCD results from a fear or emotion filled ‘memory’. When this is triggered by exposure to particular situations, then a corrective response occurs (e.g checking or cleaning repeatedly) because of the emotion that occurs which drives the need to carry out a corrective behaviour.
The aim of ET + RP is to create emotional processing so the unpleasant fear memory no longer produces such a large emotional response. The fear memory cannot be deleted but the emotion attached to it can be processed under certain conditions. The two most important are exposure to the situation that provokes, for an extended period (say 30 minutes for example). But this only works if the corrective responses are prevented. Too short a period (say 2 minutes) and/or continuation of the corrective responses prevents this emotional processing. Indeed continuation of these responses may gradually make the OCD worse.
The difficulty for most is at the beginning the emotional reactions with RP are large and it only over time that they decrease (with repeated sessions). Some people find it too difficult to tolerate and hence give up early in the process.
Yes people with milder OCD can treat themselves and as treatment is time limited the aim of any good therapist is to foster self-management as therapy progresses.
Some aspects which can make ET+RP harder to use are clinical depression (and sometimes antidepressant medication is of value because of this), and poor emotional regulation skills and co-morbid problems such as alcohol/drug misuse.
I am aware of one self help book that uses the above principles of treatment: Daring to Challenge OCD: Overcome Your Fear of Treatment and Take Control of Your Life Using Exposure and Response Prevention – 11 Sept. 2014 Joan Davidson.",OCD
416,"Yes, OCD therapies are effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of symptoms when performed by a trained professional and when the person with OCD is motivated to change and willing to try and put in the commitment required.
Cognitive and behavioral therapies have shown better results at helping both children and adults with OCD than that of medications. These therapies can also be combined with medications.
Though medication and therapy are the primary weapons against OCD, learning and practicing relaxation techniques can go a long way in treating the condition. Deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation are some ways in which one can devise a self-help strategy.",OCD
417,"The most effective treatment for OCD is exposure with response prevention. Let’s say the person’s rituals involve repetitive checking that the door is locked. When he’s getting ready to leave he’s allowed to check once, then must walk away and leave. ( there are techniques to make it a gradual process). Do this consistently and the compulsion to check will disappear.
There are several very good self-help books. One I’ve used is Taking Control by (I think) Lee Jacobs.",OCD
418,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD
419,"I think CBT therapy is the main form of therapy for OCD.
CBT is used to change the way we think in order to reflect the way we feel. We can often get stuck in faulty thought patterns. CBT disrupts this pattern in order to form healthier thoughts or reactions to things, which in turn, helps us to change our actions.",OCD
420,"OCD is one of the mental health disorders that is most often minimized or dismissed by people who don't have it. They say things like:
“Oh, everybody has OCD”. (No, they don't. Worldwide, the prevalence of OCD is about 1.5%, and in the U.S., it's just over 2%.)
and:
“Just quit worrying so much"". (Oh, thanks, doc, I never thought of that. Hallelujah, I'm cured!)
It's been minimized to the degree that people now commonly use “OCD"" as an adjective meaning orderly or anal-retentive, and there are “fun"" online quizzes like, “how OCD are you?” These quizzes are almost invariably focused on neatness and tidiness, which many people seem to think equate to OCD, when the disorder manifests in various ways. Plenty of people with OCD, myself included, are not obsessive about tidiness and are not germophobes.
Basically, OCD is often seen as a minor, “cute"" disorder. Some people even say they'd like to have it because they'd keep their house cleaner. This completely misunderstands what OCD actually is, and is a slap in the face of people who actually live with the disorder.
There is nothing cute about OCD. It's not fun. People who obsessively clean their houses because of OCD aren't doing it because they like a clean house, they're doing it because of invasive thoughts telling them that something catastrophic will happen if they don't.
Likewise, as a checker, I check my stove and my door locks multiple times before leaving the house because my brain is telling me that the stove is on and the house will burn down, or the door is open and anyone can just walk in, and if those things happen, my life will be in shambles and it will be ALL MY FAULT. It doesn't matter if I know I haven't used the stove since the last time I left the house, and that my rational brain knows the stove is not on. OCD is not rational, and those of us who have it know it's not rational, which only makes it worse, because despite that knowledge, we can't prevent the thoughts and the anxiety they cause.
My obsession with “safe"" and “unsafe” numbers benefits me in no way whatsoever. Counting every step and every sip of water also benefits me in no way whatsoever. Constantly worrying that my house will burn down or be invaded does me no good at all. My obsessive thoughts and brain that refuses to rest bring me little but insomnia; it's very rare for me to get more than five hours of sleep a night, regardless of how tired my body is.
I don't know if “offended"" is the right word. “Annoyed”. “Irritated”. Those might be better. Sometimes I wish I could give all those people who make light of OCD the actual disorder for a week. Then they can tell me how cute it is.",OCD

Frantic attempts to avoid doing one’s own school or college assignments.
Repeatedly posting one’s assignments on Quora in the hopes that someone else will complete the assignment.
The behaviors cause significant distress or annoyance to the users of Quora.
Trauma implications include the user being blocked and muted. Cultural implications include the overall culture of Quora being negatively affected by these kinds of questions.
The specific example is the question above.",OCD
422,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
423,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
424,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

425,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine.

I was also attaching bad thoughts if I wasn't able to do it right ! I was always in a manic frame of mind. Id displayed OCD traits as early as 11. The fully suppressed emotions of years & years of abuse. With no way of ending the abuse. And unable to release my emotions. I'd developed these early OCD habits as an outlet & a release for my energy.",OCD
427,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
428,"It would probably depend on the person, because different sufferers have different obsessions and compulsions, and, obviously, different personalities. Some people might be very uncomfortable with being touched, asked to share utensils or glasses, or discussing OCD in a group as it can be very personal.
These are my personal pet peeves:
When people causally say ""I am so OCD!"" Kind of makes it seem like an endearing quirk, rather than a potentially debilitating mental disorder. Also, I don't like the grammar. OCD isn't what I am.
When people make assumptions about what it means for my life, or about how I experience OCD.
When people tell me they think it's cool.
When people tell me things they do that are unusual, in an attempt to relate. For example, ""Well, I only eat the red M&Ms.. isn't that weird?"" There is a difference between preference and compulsion.",OCD
429,"For me the key to recovery was learning to label my intrusive thoughts, feelings and sensations. No matter how real they feel I just tell myself, ""Nope. This is an OCD thing and I know how this ends."" I do not push the thoughts away...I simply choose not to waste anymore than 2 seconds trying to figure them out.(Why am I having this thought? What does this mean? What does this say about me? Could it be true? What if? What if? What if?). Historically, me trying to answer these questions have in no way provided me with any kind of long term relief. Short term? Yes. Long term. Never. I simply choose not to engage. I observe the thought, feeling or sensation. I label it as OCD then I refocus on more important things. By the way...literally anything is more important than engaging with your OCD. As time goes on you start to see the change. Before you know it, days will have gone by and you'll think, ""Wow! I haven't thought about XYZ in a minute"", and you'll slowly start becoming more productive, stress free, and engaged. You just have to trust the process and STICK WITH IT. You may still have the thoughts, and depending on a particular obsessions impact on your life...you'll likely have them until the day you die. But you'll no longer find them distressing in the way that they use to be, and your perspective regarding them will have vastly changed...I am in OCD remission, and my life is amazing.",OCD
430,"Let me start by saying that I have been suffering from severe OCD from early childhood and I have tried many meds, therapies and techniques to get better.
There are several other iPhone apps I know of that are designed to help people who have OCD. The only one I would seriously recommend is ""Live OCD Free"" by Pocket Therapist, LLC. The very steep price of $80 came as a shock to me but after reviewing the app I think it's totally worth it. You'd spend that much $ for a therapy session alone and the app contains a complete therapy program (ERP) you can use by yourself, at home.
Another app I tried is ""It's Done"" by A.J. Lester & Associates, Inc. It basically just let's you check off tasks that you've performed with a few additional features. The UI is so clumsy and poorly designed that I deleted it after a few hours. Also, it hasn't been updated since May 2011.
Then there are two apps which contain a limited free version ""Door Lock Helper OCD"" and ""Appliance Helper OCD"" by Calm Apps. I have not tried these apps but apparently they let you note when you lock/unlock doors or plug/unplug appliances respectively.
The reason why I'm a big fan of the first app is that it actually provides you with tools to get better and potentially free yourself from OCD instead of using an app to track your obsessions or compulsions... which might seem faster in the short term but ultimately enables your OCD and makes it worse.",OCD
431,"Sure but I do not think they are marketed as OCD things.
I no longer check my doors because I have one of those number pad locks that auto lock after the door shuts.
Same with garage door.
I can use security systems with web cams to check on things like stove or lights from phone.
I can check change thermostat remotely from phone.
I can organize my music collection from my phone though this took a little bit of extra work but very rewarding.
For me it is more about being creative with tech that is already out there that is part of your OCD trigger/compulsions.
These are just a few of the things that reduce noise for me.
Now one has to be careful. I have developed an unusual attachment to my phone that I have to keep an eye on. I have to practice aversion therapy with it.",OCD
432,"I’ve had diagnosed OCD since age 8. I never think of them as rituals. “Compulsions” is a phrase nearer the mark, but I would actually say that I experience them as gaps in short-term memory.
Let me explain.
One of my issues is handwashing. I worry that my hands are not clean enough, free of germs or chemicals, to cook or to handle a baby. I wash them. Then as I turn away from the sink, I stop because I can’t remember if I actually washed them, or just intended to.
Have you ever meant to take a pill or something and can’t remember if you actually did it or just meant to? Similarly, the lack of memory of handwashing vexes me to the point I feel like I have to wash them again just to be sure. I wash them again. Then I turn to whatever it was I was planning to cook. Did I wash my hands?
Half of the problem comes from going on autopilot while I’m handwashing, I think. I don’t think about what I’m doing, so I’ve got no memory of it. I try to combat this with scented soaps so that I can sniff-test my skin. But what if the scent is lingering from earlier? What if I’ve touched something since?
I touch the countertop and can’t remember if I sanitized it recently. What if an egg had touched it? What if raw meat has touched it? What about dirt or chemicals from produce? What about snail-borne brain-eating amoebas? I’d better sanitize it again to make sure. The wet dish cloth bothers me. What else has it touched? Better wash my hands.
This is how my day goes. My hands are rough and red. In the winter they swell, crack and throb. It gets worse when I feel stressed or out of control.
I have other manifestations, but handwashing is the bad one. I don’t necessarily feel like I have to perform a handwashing ritual to stave off disaster, but that I try to remember having completed a healthy, one-time wash and can’t, so I have to do it again and again.",OCD
433,I know of no technology to do as you suggest. It would be a good idea to develop such a technology. You should give it a try. Good luck.,OCD
434,"I’m sure some people could give a detailed scientific definition and explanation, but as a sufferer myself, I can try to give a more relatable answer that might give you a better idea of what it actually feels like.
Firstly, OCD is an anxiety disorder and this is what fuels it. Sufferers can have an infinitely wide range of ‘flavours’ of OCD (ie. what they worry about, what compulsive behaviours they do) but in every case it has the same root cause, which is anxiety.
Anxiety, is obviously an emotion everyone experiences, but with anxiety disorders, anxiety fires too frequently and at unhelpful times. Someone with an anxiety disorder might seem to get anxious over nothing, and a ‘normal person’ won’t understand why they get anxious. I’m sure there is a scientific explanation for this, but the explanation that’s always made sense to me is that we are either more prone to anxiety in the first place or never learned how to deal with it properly at a young age - or a combination of both.
Whatever the explanation is, all anxiety disorder sufferers have anxiety in abundance and either don’t know how to deal with it, or don’t know how to deal with such high levels of it. It becomes almost torture.
OCD sufferers however, develop a way to deal with it in the form of compulsions (rituals). We discover that certain behaviours ease our anxiety and so we perform them over and over again. They turn into a safety net and it becomes almost like an addiction. Two things happen when we do this:
We justify the fear. By continuing to perform the rituals, the fears are validated and are negatively reinforced. We become even more scared of them.
We depend on the compulsions. Compulsions become part of your life and feel like a safety net preventing your fears from happening. You can start to see why this might be a problem.
If we stop doing the compulsions, the safety net is ripped away and the original anxiety returns, except it’s multiplied tenfold. As I mentioned earlier, this is torture. If you’re standing there questioning whether to do a ritual or not, it is so much easier to just do it and move on with your life anxiety free, instead of not doing it and then getting crippled with anxiety for an hour, day or even week. Anxiety stays in your headspace - it’s job is literally to warn you of impending danger so you can’t just give it 10 minutes and forget about it.
With some compulsions, it can be somewhat easy to not do them as the anxiety levels around that particular compulsion is quite low, but for some it feels next to impossible. I’ve literally sat in my room for days, fearing that I’ve broken my neck and was going to die any second while continuously googling to try and ease my fear (textbook compulsion - would not recommend).
Not sure whether you were looking for such a long answer but hope this answers your question!",OCD
435,"When I was a child/teenager, I used to write parts of conversation with my mother on pieces of paper, which I then kept in a drawer; I realized it was something irrational, but I felt that I had to do it, otherwise something bad would have happened to me, or someone close to me.
I used to wear a certain number of bracelets, in certain colors, and with certain symbols (for example, the Christian cross and the four-leaf clover); if I hadn't worn them, I would have had an unlucky day.
I used to follow a precise sequence of actions, in order to turn my computer off, for example, before a school exam; if I happened to skip one, I had to restart all over again, otherwise, I would have become anxious, thinking that I would have failed the exam (studying hard was not enough).
I used to hoard old toys, even if I didn't like them; I thought that if I threw them, they would have felt useless, abandoned, alone and sad in the garbage (well, that was probably a projection).
I used to leave the doorknob in a certain position, so I could know if my parents had entered my room, probably touching and contaminating my stuff; in that case, I had to clean/wash everything in there, and sometimes even throw away things that I couldn't clean/wash properly or at all.
Luckily, now that I’m an adult, I’ve been able to get rid of some of the above listed intrusive thoughts and rituals; I still have the hygiene OCD, that is the problem of frequent handwashing (which makes my hands bleeding), and the contamination anxiety. My anxiety doesn’t stem from the fear of getting sick, but from a feeling of disgust when touching my stuff, and knowing they have come into contact with something (even non visibly) dirty.
Also, my intrusive thoughts become more insistent when I’m feeling unwell, very tired because of my job/insomnia issues, and when there is an unaddressed personal issue in my life, which is actually underlying some of my anxieties; resting/sleeping, addressing personal issues can be very helpful for me, in order to better rationalize, reduce the overwhelming intensity of my intrusive thoughts, and thus delay/avoid the rituals.",OCD
436,"OCD can differ a lot from person to person but it often has to do with overthinking stuff, having urges, having to do rituals the same way again and again, Not being able to concentrate, feeling stupid and feeling like you are a bad person.
The thing is that your question could also be: Why can’t people stop having their mental disorders. We can’t! Thats just how we are! Of course we can do therapy etc to help us but some people just don’t have the power to contact a doctor because there mental illness is so bad.
Specifically about OCD:
So yeah I had really bad OCD and now I am gonna tell you why I couldn’t stop overthinking and doing my rituals:So first of all I knew that „normal“ people( people without OCD! So much more persons) also didn’t do those rituals wich means I knew that what I did is stupid, because nothing happened to them even though they didn't do those rituals. Most of people suffering with OCD know what they do is stupid! This makes it even harder for us because we know we could just stop and nothing would happen! But the thing is that we often may believe that nothing would happen(99%) but we would not forget this (1%). Another thing is that we think something more evil will happen(something more bad) if you touch someone you might think the possibility to get sick is pretty low as well as you might think that even if you get something you would be sick for 1–2days and then everything will be fine again(wich is why you don’t even think of doing rituals over and over again because it’s even preferable to have to sneeze a bit for one or two days then to spent 6hours a day on rituals etc.) But like I said people with OCD are just too scared they are the 0,000001% and they also think of much more bad things that could happen!(btw of course people have different problems! Not every person with OCD is scared of touching people or something. It all differs). Another thing is that they not only do it for theme selves! They are actually really scared that it’s they fault that a family member or someone else gets sick! They feel like it’s their fault so they like to be on the safe side! (Again thats my experience).
So I used the example of someone who is scared of getting sick. But people have different rituals and different worries so not everyone with OCD is scared of touching others.I think that’s something always to remember because I hated when people thought they knew my thought and what i am scared of, because of other people with OCD that had some pretty popular worries of people with OCD.",OCD
437,"Obsessive-Compulsive disorder is one of the very common anxiety disorders. People with OCD have obsessive thoughts about a specific thing. These thoughts are uncontrollable and usually entail the fear that if a certain ritual is not performed something bad will happen. For example, some people get obsessive thoughts to check house locks again and again. To get rid of these fearful thoughts, people with OCD thus indulge in certain rituals like checking the locks three times before they go to sleep. These rituals are compulsions thus giving the disorder its name obsessive-compulsive disorder. One reason that people with OCD cannot stop performing compulsions is that if they don’t they get very anxious. So compulsions are just a way to get rid of the obsessive thoughts which are uncontrollable.",OCD
438,"Everyone has their own version of running from reality, so there is no one ritual that is universal. Focusing on the solution is better, to replace the ritual. I found releasing the past harms with a counselor, I could replace the rituals with healthy behaviors in a rational clear headed state was the only way to move into being real.
When I gave up all prescriptions, I could see what I was doing that was not productive and change my ways into providing rational results. The feelings felt good and so why not give up the past and live in the now as a sane person. Love heals all. I replace the past with forgiveness, compassion, gratitude and unconditional love. I saw the how the rituals kept me from being in the presence of a loving universe that cared for me.",OCD
439,"First off, you should start supplementing daily with magnesium citrate. OCD is related to anxiety and gets worse with anxiety. Magnesium helps lower anxiety levels in the body by helping the body to relax and make more calming brain hormones (neurotransmitters).
Medications to treat OCD can sometimes make the root cause worse because they can deplete B complex vitamins, which then will make it more difficult for the body to make calming brain hormones, so anxiety will actually go up and OCD behavior will go up.
OCD is related to over activity of the cingulate gyrus part of the the brain. Magnesium helps relax a tissues in the body, so it will help with any anxiety related disorder.
Also swimming and sitting in a sauna, or doing Ashtanga yoga and slow type weight lifting exercises are good. They will help relax the muscles by using up excess phosphorus and calcium that can make the system over active and they will also help cleanse toxins out of the body that could be could be contributing to a stress response.
And make sure to drink enough water, as dehydration can lead to a stress response that will cause or make an OCD episode worse. And along with drinking water, make sure to eat whole non processed foods and avoid processed foods which are high in MSG which depletes B6 and if you are B6 deficient, you will have more OCD. B6 is needed to make calming brain hormones and if you don’t have enough B6, you can suffer from anxiety etc.
Another thing to do is to get your genes mapped to see if you have any significant genetic mutations that could be causing both magnesium and B complex vitamin deficiencies that would lead to calming brain hormone deficiencies which then would cause anxiety /OCD.
See 23andme dot com and genetic genie dot org for more info on this. Certain mutations like MTHFR and CBS 699 mutations and ACE deletions can cause more anxiety by setting the chemistry in the body off balance. They all cause magnesium and b complex depletion and those are the base materials needed to make calming brain hormones, and if you don’t have them, you won’t have enough calming brain hormones like serotonin and GABA and you anxiety /OCD will escalate.
So: start supplementing daily with magnesium citrate.
Exercising or swimming daily
Drink enough water.
Eat whole non processed food. Don’t wait too long to eat as hunger can cause anxiety too.
Look into getting your genes mapped.
Good luck.",OCD
440,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
441,"We are all different types of people, in my personal experience I did had to overcome some of my OCD ( worst of all I never realized that ” that once were part of my OCD ” ) I always knew I was kinda different ( but when people wanted to say to me ” you are this or that…. I remember answering them! Yes and I love it!!! I have to be 100% honest with all of you and let you know that growing up in a third world country and being different it wasn't easy ( even now a days any kind of mental illness, disability FOR ME ” mental gifts ” its a taboo.
I am 45 years old I live in Canada since I was 26 years old and I finally got diagnostic with OCD, ADHD, PTSD, Severe deprecion, BPD…. among others letter of the alphabet but most importantly I am ME. The only thing I was sure that I had from way before it was that I did have a learning disability, dyslexia, and stubborn.
I was told I was never going to be able to finish high school, or to have a career, forget about university or to get a job. Well for all of you reading this and have heard something like this…. I hope that you ignore them. I finished school, high school, university with the highest honors, three university degrees and landed amazing jobs, even when I came to Canada that everyone told me I was not going to be able to find a job ( cause as you can see English is not my first neither second language ) well they were mistaken too.
Going back to the question ( I do apologize for the loop ) when my first born was 6 years old he asked me mom can we go to the park and then suddenly the OCD on me start to take control and say ” nobody goes nowhere until your toys, school stuff & your room is perfect!!! Two minutes later he comes to me and say mom can I ask you 1 question? I said yes, he said mom to your standards or to normal people standards? My heart sinked and that's when I realized that although I never had a problem with my OCD whatsoever and had always been extremely upfront with whomever I was dating from day one with my habits ( I NEVER EVER REALIZE how it was afeccting, bothering, upsetting, influencing…. My kids and people that I thought it wasn't necessary for me to tell them or that they wouldn't realize. )
My Shrink have help me lots ( it wasn't easy trying to find the correct medication lucky for me I did ) in my case therapy didn't work and honestly I think unless the person doing the therapy has OCD I will be willing to try it. My OCD is not gone and I feel blessed for that what I did is trade it sounds stupid maybe but I can care less what other think about me, all my life I have been criticized no matter what something was always wrong about me. When I used to take my kids to the paediatrician it was a mental work out I just wanted to fix absolutely everything the books, toys, chairs, magazines you name it ( of course everyone will be looking at me as what is she doing. ) well I found my ways to do that without raising people attention I will start to play with my kids with one toy that was already on the floor and then put it away, on the right place, then play with other one…. Of course I wouldn't be able to finish the task of fixing the room an as a OCD that's a NO NO! but I will count how many toys stayed out of place and on the way home we will play to make words with the letters of the license plate of the cars that where ahead of us. And that's how I survived just trying my very best to keep it more to myself. Now my boys are at university and I am back to the same me and I love it. I always had at the back of my mind that I screwed up my monkeys until they come often to visit me even with friends and the oldest one one day was just touching all the surface of everything. I asked him what are you doing? He answer oh mom you have no idea how much I miss this, I say this? Yes this, this feeling of cleaning of knowing that if something falls its okay just picked up and he gave me a big hug and said to me mom never change I love you just the way you are.
There are always going to be challenged in life big, small, easy, hard, once that you might think will be impossible to achieve or get over…. The truth is that I can promise you that if you really put your mind on something most probably you are going to be able to do it. But then you have to evaluate the consequences of your choice. Are you doing it because that's what you want or because you think that's what is best for you ( and in which way ) once you know that answer. Then asked yourself is this a permanent decision ? or is a tryout ( whatever the answer to that question is *** on my experience I wouldn’t share what Is that you are planning to do until you feel that you have it under control )
We OCD people don’t enjoy to leave undone stuff and even worse if others know about it. I really hope that this have helped you. It’s hard to answer this kind of questions when you don’t know exactly what are your biggest trades of OCD.
Wish you the very best

442,"Overcome it as in never have it rear its ugly face again in your life, the way you can overcome a cold?
No, not at all.
You are not your thoughts or your anxieties. When you understand this and start to believe it, then if horrible thoughts come up, they won't matter, because the momentum behind them has been deflated. If an OCD thought or compulsion comes up and there is a spike of anxiety, who cares? Flinches and reflexes are normal in the body, so why not the mind?
If you do relapse a bit and go to make sure the door was locked, well, you checked. Can't change the past now. It doesn't mean you are relapsing, it just means you have some scar tissue. Most survivors do.
Overcoming it means being at peace with what is in you. It doesn't mean obliterating it out existence.

443,"OCD is an insidious problem. It starts from occasional episodes to regular ones, starting from being mild to moderate to severe if left untreated. It is debilitating, intrusive and can interfere in the normal functioning of a person. People with severe levels have stopped working, their anxiety can limit their ability to discharge responsibilities. They get into a shell fearing embarrassment and inability to stay in control. It needs treatment and systematic exposure to stimulus. If left untreated, it can control the sufferer’s life to an extent that due to distress & repeated compulsions, he can have suicidal thoughts. It is crucial that it is treated.",OCD

447,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.

450,"I was one a child with OCD.
I dont know how it started but Ive had OCD ever since I could remember.
My mind was sooo clouded by all these irrational, scary, repetitive thoughts that I had no spare time to think about anything else in the world.
I remember being 10 years old and I couldnt even understand the concept of a wall clock and how to read it, I was the dumbest in school, always being threatened to get kicked out, while my twin sister was the smartest, always ranking first, olympics and such. My thoughts would be filled with all these nonsense about repeating patterns I would find everywhere; alphabets, numbers, steps, down to the ridges of my fingers, its hard to explain, but I remember my head was so clouded by it all day long it was like a constrained routine I had made for myself, all driven by my fear of death.
I would also make clicking sounds with my mouth, of course, with patterns and repetition that never seemed to end. It was only one of the countless things I would do in public in order to relieve my “need” of repetition. It had gotten to the point where people around me are irritated by me, my parents, my schoolmates, I became socially anxious. People always think Im weird, I couldnt fit anywhere.
My family? I would barely see my dad as he is a very busy business man, my mom saw my OCD as no other than annoyance and always scold me with hurtful words. She didnt really care about me as she has got 2 other daughters with excellent academic performance she would gladly give all her attention to. My sisters always thought I was weird, they destroyed a teddy bear my dad had given me, the teddy was my sanctuary, a friend who would never judge me and always there for me like nobody else ever been. I was alone in this world.
I also remember how I could only sleep after all the curtains have been perfectly closed, my blankets wrinkle-free, all the toys arranged, bla bla bla to the smallest details of dust and bits until i could finally go to sleep at 2 am, as if that wasnt enough, I would constantly go back and forth to wash my hands with soap in the middle of the night, whenever I close the bathroom door I had to rub the round door handle 3 times( i know its weird) and I was only 8 years old at that time. Everything was hard for me, especially when everyone around me kept pushing me down even more with their ignorance and lack of sympathy and affection.
When Im asked to recall my childhood, all I feel is anxiety; a constant worry of all the irrational habits I used to do, and the horrible thoughts that came along with it, always circulating around death. Never a day in my childhood where I was worry-free.
Everything changed when my family moved house, it was the center of the town, few hours car ride away from the old house. Suddenly it was as if I opened my eyes for the first time in my life. Im not sure how to explain it. I went from the dumbest, most despised person in my school to being the top 3 for years in a row at my new school. I learned alot of things, the world was very new to me, and I was ready to explore everything it has to offer. I continued to strive in my education, I jumped a few grades, my IQ was around 140, etc. and now Im studying Art in a university.
After further research I found out that a change of environment could help with OCD but its hard to believe it could go to this extent..
Even though I still have depression and bipolar disorder as a result of the OCD that filled my entire childhood, Im content, and im grateful that Ive been given a chance in life.
Just to give a glimpse of my everyday life in my childhood, this is how my morning would go;
When I get off the bed in the morning, my feet would have to touch the floor at the same time with all my soles touching the ground, repeat until done perfectly. when I walk I have to count my steps and finish with an even number by the time I get to the bathroom, i have to touch the bathroom handle with my full grip perfectly and then turn it, I brush my teeth at least twice, wash my hands between every insignificant action all the while brushing my teeth etc. I would put on my school uniform over and over til I think its just right, then check all the curtains open and tidied up as its supposed to be before leaving home, and also to put on my shoes repeatedly until i think its just right.
This will go on forever tbh im tired goodnight",OCD
451,"Yes Knew someone with OCD .Her condition worsened so much that there was once a time that she would not let anyone enter her room .She used to wear a pair of clothes which she washed and wore even when they were wet despite having a walk-in wardrobe with 100s of clothes.She was reduced to a pale frail reflection of herself .Someone who was a vivacious woman once was a weak ,haggard shabby looking person who was just worried about washing hands,taking baths for hours ,washing all the things of her house many times,uttering a sentence the same way many times ,having distressing thoughts about everything .And when she was on verge of suicide she opened up to her relatives who then took her to a psychiatrist who immediately put her on real heavy dosage of medicines and explained her illness to her relatives .Slowly she started recovering and was told if her illness and she being highly intelligent started reading about it to have a better understanding.She recovered quite remarkably after a long period but not completely.She was given CBT for sometime but she instead of adhering to it started avoiding everything which caused panic to her .That was not right for she relapsed and was again put on medicines and the thing is being repeated after every few months .The forms of OCD keep changing but now they have turned more monstrous and accompanied by acute phobia ,depression ,extreme mood swings .When she is doing fine she is the most amiable person on this earth but when she has an episode then she just doesn’t understand what is going on .She just carries on with her obsessive and compulsive streaks.Its the most debilitating time of her life .",OCD

453,"Hello! My name is Rahul. And I have successfully recovered from severe OCD of 7 years. Let me tell you how.
It all started when I was 15. I started having superstition that my certain actions cause certain results. Slowly it began to graduate and I started associating my fears with my actions i.e. if I don't do this, that will happen. It didn't took me long to develop rituals like checking every door, tap and window before going to bed, writing and cutting off words if it didn't get written in particular pattern, bowing at every temple, mosque or gurudwara in my way, taking God's name if even a slight bad thought crossed my mind and so on… You can guess soon it became extremely frustrating and impossible for me to live. I was living in my head and not in the real world.
Everyone started noticing my weird habits. I realised I needed help. At the age 17 I went to my first psychiatrist. But that doctor was bit selfish and keen on selling meds and gave me lots of high doses medicines. Result was it made me super drowsy and I was just sleeping my days off most of the time. And whenever I missed any dose, it drove me crazy, my skin started pinching and I couldn't sleep.
So I changed the doctor after 6–7 months. This doctor gave me mild doses which reduced my rituals by 20–30% but I was still suffering. So I stopped my meds and made up my mind that whatever my mind tells me to do, I won't do it. Result - Didn't help much.
Now I was 20 and still suffering. So I went to a very senior/experienced psychiatrist. He was bit strict but gave me just one tablet - Chlomipramine 25 mg and later increased the dose to 50mg and 75mg per day. It helped me a lot and my OCD got reduced by 70–80%. But here I need to mention that some very major changes occurred in my life during that time. I met a girl, fell in love, started taking care of myself and started enjoying my days more or less. The arrival of someone in my life along with some other positive changes (which I mentioned below) naturally brought a level of newness, excitement and zeal with it which also helped me a lot. So I continued that med for 6 more years.
Now I was 26, in a new city, having my dream job of being a script writer albeit having a degree in computer science, happily in a relationship with that beautiful girl. Life was going good but I still had minor fears and rituals, you can say 20% of the OCD. So I decided to visit a new psychiatrist. I opened practo.com, reviewed every psychiatrist based on experience and public’s feedback and booked an appointment.
And this Doctor was like an angel sent from heaven (I can share his details if you like). He listened to me, my medical history and gave me few meds, injection (for some chemical which was less in my body). A course of 6 months and I am completely cured now. I never thought I will be free from OCD one day, I kind of accepted that this is my life now and things will never get better. But here I am- Happy, Healthy and Full of Life.
So What Helped:-
The Unconditional love and support of my parents, brother, sister and girlfriend. They always stayed by my side, understood my pain (no matter how superficial it seemed to them or hurt them) and never let me stay in a bad place for too long.
Getting my ass off that bed and seeing a doctor. The best decision I made in my life was to get help.
Significant changes in my lifestyle. Falling in love, developing a hobby (for me it was participating in quiz contests, during my college life I participated in every tech fest of every college in my district).
Also SITCOMS. Believe it or not, shows like FRIENDS, How I met your Mother, The Office, Parks and Rec, Modern Family helped me lot to laugh, feel light and connect to something to crawl out of that crippling depression.
And Most Importantly FAITH. When you replace FEAR with FAITH in GOD, Fear loses its power. If your mind tells you do this 15 times otherwise that will happen, tell your mind that it is just a figment of your imagination created due to imbalance of serotonin and dopamine in your brain and nothing will happen if you don't do what it tells you to do. Once you realise that you defied your brain’s silly command and everything is still as it was, you will have power over your disease. And FAITH in GOD gives you that Power to stay strong and face your fear. But remember, FAITH and FEAR is completely opposite. Faith does not mean you start fearing God, it means you start trusting God.
What didn't Helped:-
Choosing the wrong psychiatrist. Trust me a bad doctor can worsen your life. Always go for an experienced doctor. Research about them, take feedback from people. Now there are lots of websites with patients feedbacks. You can check them out and select a doctor whose reviews match your condition.
Staying all day in the bed, aloof, accepting the fact that nothing will get better and I will be like this always.
Being careless and ignorant about my disease. OCD like any physical disease like flu or cold is just an imbalance of chemicals in body and completely treatable. With Right Attitude, Right Doctor and Right Medication you will get better and eventually completely cured.
I hope my answer gives you Hope, Strength and Insight that OCD is Curable and you will get better. God Bless ^_^",OCD
454,"This is my story
As far as I can remember, there were always intrusive thoughts encompassing me. Some disturbing images displayed in my head making me feel a great agitation as I was in that time somewhat religious believing that everything i did was a sin, representing my distorted being. Growing up wasn’t an easy job. Rituals were done according to their rules and must have been done, if not, I felt crushed in my soul, felt disturbing anxiety about my future as it was always unexpected. I was always worried about events that held unexpected outcomes, they forced my to repeatedly check if things are right or not, and am I able to do such thing. My performance in school was good but there were always some internal thoughts that hindered my ability to concentrate, think and complete things. I was anxious in most situations and I always had to analyse given event, most often falling into the deaf episode of depression where my a priori always needed to check and check
Now, fortunately after i was diagnosed, take medication and OCD diminished in some of it's factors leaving only a note in my head of past events.",OCD
455,"It can get quite bad. I will provide one example that isn’t very bad but it really hurt.
At around the age of seven, my OCD was at its peak. I was doing things 8 times a day, including washing my hands. By the end of the spike in OCD tendencies, my hands were red and raw. Most of the skin was either peeling, dry, or gone completely. I know other people might have it much worse than I did, but that’s my short story.",OCD
456,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
457,"It never goes away. It always finds new forms to take.
Sometimes, it's thoughts. Jumping out of my chair, and running like a mad-man to get to the lavatory and come back on time, because the thoughts say that if you don't get back within thirty seconds, your whole family will die. It's illogical, it's irrational, but you can't help it. Your mother wants to know why you keep running out of your seat. You tell her it's because you really need the bathroom, for fear of sounding crazy.
I’ll be sitting in school, doing my work, when a thought tells me, “If you don't fit that whole sentence into one line, your grandmother will die of a heart attack tomorrow.” I know it's stupid, but if you read my book, you can see where my writing has become squished up. I have to obey the thoughts.
Other times, it's washing my hands compulsively. If I touch something that I perceive to be dirty, I feel a ping on my hands. If I touch a wall, I feel my hands ping. The ping stays until I wash my hands. The thoughts tell me, “Don't touch your face, you’ll become ill.” The skin on my hands feel like sand-paper because of it.
Sometimes, it's picking at my skin, to create sores. I can't stop it. Sometimes, I pick at my scalp, other times, I pick at my lips. Sometimes, I do it out of compulsion, other times, I do it unknowingly.
Recently, I noticed that my skin felt a bit smoother, and I realised that I hadn't been washing my hands as much. But, what I also realised, was that I wasn't washing my hands anymore, because I was picking my skin again. Here is what my lips look like.
It's disgusting, it's horrid and I'm deeply ashamed and embarrassed because of it. I wear lip gloss to hide the damage.
But, even though my lips are in a terrible state, the thoughts are much worse.
It's like a screaming match going on in your own mind. Have you ever had a friend, who constantly talks about something that makes you feel uncomfortable? You have to cover your ears and scream, “La la la.” That's what it's like in my head. I can't tell anybody about these thoughts, because I fear that they will come true- if I tell anyone. They cause me a great deal of anxiety, even though I know they're illogical.",OCD
458,"My mind is constantly moving. It never rests. I have to be thinking about something, or more accurately, I have to be thinking obsessively about something.
I used to think it would be cool to try meditation, that it would calm me.
But I can't. I can't “clear my mind” and think of nothing. Whatever little part of the brain allows people to do that, mine either doesn't work or is simply absent.
Falling asleep is hard unless I'm utterly exhausted, because I can't shut my brain off. It just wants to keep going and going and going, like that pink Energizer bunny with his drum.
I count everything. I have an obsession with “safe” and “unsafe” numbers. One of the only problems I have with my new apartment is that it is on the 2nd floor, and the steps number 13. 13 is an unsafe number. I try to force myself not to count the steps so I don't get anxious and convince myself that something bad will happen. But that's really, really hard, so sometimes I take two small steps on the bottom step, which is stone and a little wider than the rest, so I can tell myself it's really 14 steps. 14 is a safe number.
I am at a point now at which unless I am especially stressed, I can usually get out of the house in the morning after checking everything no more than twice — stove, light switches, thermostat, electrical cords, door locks. It used to be 4 or 5 times, sometimes as many as 8 on a bad day. I've made progress.
Living with OCD is exhausting. The dumbest little things that “normal” people never even think about get caught in the web of my brain and stay there, circling around and around, refusing to leave.
But it's all I know. It's just how my brain works.
All of this is why it's so upsetting when people minimize OCD and reduce it to a personality quirk. Perfectionism, or anal retentiveness, or being uptight.
That's not what it is at all. It's much worse and much more complicated than that.
I wish I knew what life was like without it.",OCD
459,"Research.
Wonderful research. Via the internet.
I was fourteen years old. I was doing things I never did before. I had thoughts I never had before.
I had read a book where the protagonist had OCD. I began to notice these characteristics in myself.
And then I went on holiday. Overseas for the first time. That made my OCD officially “start”.
I would have all these thoughts telling me to do things to stop someone from vomiting, or stop the plane from crashing. And I would do these things, and people didn’t puke, and the plane didn’t crash.
I also became very wary of germs, using hand sanitiser pretty much all the time, and wearing gloves when I could.
Things started to get real bad the next year, when I was fifteen. I told the school psychologist and she made me tell my parents, otherwise she would. I never saw her again. (now I see the other psychologist at my school, who I’ve got special permission to see because she’s not meant to see people in my year group).
So I told my parents, simply because I didn’t want the psychologist to. I wasn’t ready to tell my parents.
And my parents told me they had noticed. They had noticed that I was doing all these weird things.
They took me to Headspace for counselling, which didn’t seem to work.
My thoughts became more frequent I would continue to listen to my compulsions. I would wash my hands to the point where they were so dry, cracked and painful, they would bleed with any movement.
And then I was put on medication for my OCD. My medication for it is constantly changing.
Looking back, I’ve noticed OCD traits in me for a long long long time. I used to have the compulsion to spin around in circles (even in public). Just randomly spinning around in circles - I was about ten.
I also had the compulsion to pull my hair out, but my parents think that was tricotilomania.
I guess you don’t really just “get” OCD, just like that. I feel like my OCD has become more and more noticeable.
OCD is also a part of anxiety, which I was diagnosed with at a very young age - six I think?
But I found out that I had OCD through research (didn’t do quizzes and self diagnosed, don’t worry) and the doctors confirmed that.

460,"There wasn’t a lot that could help that wasn’t ultimately counter-productive during the worst years of OCD for me. I would chant under my breath and compulsively wash and enter in and out of rooms. Sometimes I’d listen to music and try to meditate away everything.
What actually ended up working was a guided practice from a cognitive behavioral therapist who told me to willfully focus on the thoughts that gave me the most difficulty or anxiety, rather than forcefully push them out.
Bringing the thoughts into the forefront of my mind’s eye and keeping them there eventually lead to my most stubborn triggers and fears losing their potency. It took a few months of regular practice, but this exercise worked to quell the worst symptoms of OCD for me.",OCD
461,"OCD is treatable..
You are too serious about life.. Or developed a coping mechanism to worry more than usual, to recheck things more often and self doubt
This can be changed fully
Exercise meditation helps
Try to meditate for 30minutes everyday morning and before night
Do it first for 5minutes take a break for 2minutes again 5.

462,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can be challenging to manage, and finding the right treatment is crucial. While traditional therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medications such as SSRIs are commonly used, medical cannabis is gaining attention as an alternative option for those seeking a natural approach to managing OCD symptoms.
Medical cannabis, especially CBD (cannabidiol), offers unique benefits by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for regulating mood, stress, and repetitive behaviors. Studies suggest that CBD can help reduce obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions while alleviating anxiety, a major factor in OCD. Additionally, its calming effects can contribute to emotional stability and improved overall well-being.
For individuals interested in alternative treatments, OCD cannabis treatment could be a valuable addition to a comprehensive care plan. To learn more about how medical cannabis may assist in managing OCD, you can explore Releaf's page about OCD cannabis treatment. Releaf is a UK-based clinic specializing in tailored cannabis treatments designed to meet each patient's unique needs.",OCD
463,"How I controlled mine:
First and foremost, Tell that little voice inside your head that asks you to count numbers and do many irrational things to shove it up. (The voice are not hallucinations but are thoughts).
Ok so now the serious part:
Start learning more and more about anxiety and OCD. The more you learn, the more you know that its irrational. (Not that you already know that, most OCD patients already know that the fears or the obsessions and compulsions are irrational.)
Exposure : Expose yourself to your fears. Face them. This will be really very hard. But you need to do this. (For example, i was terrified of the dark, then i started meditating in a dark room. It was really hard in the beginning but the fear slowly subsided.
track your progress. write them down somewhere.
Do not avoid.
Do not rush and be patient.
3. Manage your stress with the help of breathing exercises, and whatever soothes you, like good music, etc.
4. You need to resist the urge to complete a compulsion.

464,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps people learn to recognize and change thought patterns and behaviors that lead to troublesome feelings. It helps people with OCD to identify and challenge the irrational thoughts and fears that are causing their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.
2. Exposure and response prevention (ERP): ERP is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy that involves gradually exposing a person to the source of their fear or anxiety and then teaching them how to resist the urge to perform the compulsive behavior.
3. Medication: A variety of medications, including antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and antipsychotics, may be prescribed to help manage the symptoms of OCD.
4. Complementary and alternative treatments: Complementary and alternative treatments, such as mindfulness, yoga, and acupuncture, may be helpful in reducing symptoms of OCD.

465,"Hey!
The first step towards OCD treatment or any kind of treatment of problem is recognizing the problem . As you have recognized that you have OCD ,cheers to you! Now comes the treatment part. So here the first step is to recognize your obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Any thought or behavior that triggers anxiety and causes distress as you focus more on it is your OCD thought. The best advice I can give on this earth is ‘DONT fight ‘ with that thought. Now comes how to deal with the thought :
Mindfulness - non judgmental awareness of thoughts, behaviors and senses.
Exposure and response prevention- to face your thought, your fears but not reacting to them, letting them pass ,…( it is better said then done )
Cognitive therapy - to analyze the situation, mood, thought and then challenge the irrational thoughts logically and then find a productive and logical alternative out of it and reduce the underlying distress.
Let me tell you a personal experience- the more you run away from obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, the more they will come after you. So deal with them using the above mentioned methods and if you have a few more ways, please let me know………All the best dude.!",OCD
466,"Quit fighting the OCD. Fighting thoughts and feelings is a losing proposition. When you fight them you create more emotion, criticism and anxiety which leads to more compulsive behaviors. ANd on and on.
The base issue is anxiety and the habits that are used by brain to “control” it. Accept that you are anxious and that it’s a feeling that generates energy for you to be involved and creative. It’s OK and you are OK. You have too many brain cells to try and control them. Use the energy
See my Quora space posts for the tools to work for you.",OCD
467,"your OCD is curable.You cannot lead a normal life with this disorder as it depletes your energy on your obsessions and compulsions.
However, with SSRI group of medicines especially Fluvoxamine 150 mg daily your symptoms will go into remission.You need to consult a Neurologist or Psychiatrist ASAP for evaluation and prescription.
Behavior therapy may also be required if you have problems even after medicine.All antidepressant
medication may take two to three weeks to show positive results due to brain’s endothelial blood-brain barrier.",OCD
468,"Something that helps me is to do something that will tire me out. Like going on a bike ride or playing kickball, something that will leave me to tired to want to do OCD afterward, cause lets be honest, OCD is very tiring! But if you are already tired, you don’t have room to be more tired. Another thing is to do something I really enjoy to get my mind off of it. It is especially helpful if this activity is also something that OCD makes it difficult to do. Like I enjoy playing my ukulele and singing along to it, but if have have to do a compulsion, I have to pause doing my uke. So if I can really get into it, then I don’t have anymore room to do a compulsion. If I am stuck in a series of routines, it helps me to regain my bearings by doing a thing where I find 5 things I can see, 4 things I can feel, 3 things I can hear, 2 things I can smell, and then 1 thing I can taste. My previous therapist taught me that one.",OCD
469,"The best treatment for OCD is CBT with exposure and ritual prevention. The biggest problem with this approach is the difficulty finding therapists who are trained in and willing to provide the therapy. Next best is medication. The primary medications used are known as SSRIs. These drugs can be prescribed by primary care providers and as a result are widely available. Unfortunately primary care providers may not know about the difference between treating OCD and depression with these drugs. As a result they may not use the higher dosages or expect differences in response typically seen in OCD compared to depression. Combined treatment with CBT and medications is usually better than medication alone but may not be better than CBT alone. Additional medications from different categories can be useful but you may need to see a specialist to access this type of treatment.
Another option is TMS. This involves magnetic stimulation of the brain, TMS for OCD requires a different device than the ones used to treat depression and is probably roughly equal to medications in terms of benefits.
For people with severe OCD and limited response to standard treatment, ther are options including intensive treatment programs and more invasive treatments like brain surgery including deep brain stimulation.",OCD
470,"If you’re asking my professional opinion then I say run from Xanax. Xanax, a benzodiazepine (benzo), has a rapid onset of action, hits hard and then wears off quickly. It is highly addicting, but this isn’t the reason I say that you should not use it. “Tolerance” which is when the body “gets use to using the medicine” is reached quickly which means that a larger and then larger dose would have to be taken by the individual to get relief of anxiety. But, a really nasty side effect of using such a short-acting benzo is that as soon as it wears off it causes what we call “re-bound anxiety”. The anxiety quickly hits you again and is stronger than it was originally. This is a common side effect of any benzo but because Xanax is so short-acting, it causes the anxiety to return with a vengeance. Today I just read an article about research into controlling significant anxiety (and of course OCD is an anxiety disorder as you know). The scholarly article said “mindfulness-based stress reduction was as effective as an antidepressant (which is first-line therapy for anxiety conditions) in relieving anxiety. I took a mindfulness relaxation class years ago and the techniques still work well for me. If I were you I would google to find a mindfulness class offered in your area. You won’t be sorry you took it.",OCD
471,"Xanax makes everything better… Until it doesn't. Then what you are dealing with now time a hundred is what you are left with. The thing is tolerance eventually sets in. If it weren't for that I'd still be taking my benzos and all would be well. Off and on xanax for 17 years fine. Switched to klonopin die to tolerance and was in that three years. Tried getting off. Let me tell you, hell on earth doesn't cut it. Inhumane, cruel and unusual punishment. Loose Lal faith in humanity and anything you thought to be true. Because how could one person know this is possible and still prescribe these meds. There aren't words to describe the torment I have endured. And I've been through alot, I'm not a baby or exaggerating. Do not go that route. For your sanity. For life. I lost everything due to benzos. And my ocd has hit a point so debilitating it is scary.",OCD
472,It will help with the anxiety that it causes. There's also different types of OCD. In short Xanax will not help in the long run. Besides that they are absolutely horrid to withdraw from even if you have only taken them for a short time.. an SSRI or NSRI is gonna help you in the long term far better. And if you want to get better counseling is a must. Pills can help you but you got to get counseling for there to be noticeable relief.,OCD
473,"For me Valium was the same as Xanax and I got addicted. I had to go to treatment and learn how to be rational and sane. Obsessive thinking and OCD are ways to not address the reality in front of you. Drugs/ prescriptions stop you from seeing reality because they drug you and that makes you irrational and drugged. I am off all medications now for 21 years, it has taken time to move into a rational place of addressing the next right thing for me and not acting out to stop my being real.
Try meditation, yoga, or joining a spiritual group to have a different focus. What you focus on grows and you are not focusing on something productive to move you forward. It is time to volunteer and help others at a food bank, museum, library, senior center and change your focus to giving instead of trying to protect your self from past harms. We give without expectations.
Fear is the basis for your wanting to feel secure through your actions. Walk in faith as you can not have faith and fear at the same time. Do not listen to the fear, it is not real and go forward in knowing you are doing well.",OCD
474,"Ok so this is not a medical opinion, it’s a personal one:
It can, but you must be very careful with benzodiazepines because it’s quite hard to wean off them and they lose effect after a while. Kind of like with cigarettes, but with nightmares.
One other very important thing to understand is that Xanax is not a problem solver, it’s a problem coverer. Until you work with yourself, nothing will truly go away.
These are very important to understand, because doctors tend to pop pills so he may as well prescribe it to you, because it’s thought to be not so bad.
However do some research on Google and know that, in my opinion, 60% of the bad stories are likely to be true.",OCD
475,"I do see that it is sometimes used in conjunction with other medication, usually antidepressants and therapy. What pretty much everyone has said about Benzos are true! Look, I would do whatever I could to stay away from them unless it was your last resort. Many times the “cure” is worse than the illness.
I’ve been taking Xanax for only 2 years. I have severe Panic Disorder along with 2 other mental illnesses. I needed it because my panic attacks lasted for up to 2 weeks (in varying degrees of fear) straight and feeling like you’re going to die along with having the feeling of not getting enough oxygen, even if you are.
I know your situation would be different, but if you’re suffering in some way to a degree like then I’m sure you’d be willing to take just about anything. OK, so if you were going to do this, also understand that withdrawing off this stuff is the WORST drug I’ve ever withdrawn from is Xanax. The good news however (at least in my case) is despite the wicked (and potentially dangerous withdrawal…if done wrong) only last 2 weeks. Depending on how long you’ve been taking it along with the dosage and your height and weight, it could take longer or shorter, but it has a short half-life, meaning it will leave your body sooner. BTW, the dangerous part about Xanax is if you stop Cold Turkey, you can actually go into seizures or death. That said, if you've been taking 5 mg a day (which is a lot) for two weeks straight, you could probably go CT if you wanted to, but I’m no doctor and it’s always recommended you get a doctor’s approval before you attempt something like that, if you chose to go that route, which I do NOT recommend unless it’s absolutely necessary. My withdrawal from Buprenorphine (Subutex) is much tamer (compare to Xanax) but I’ve been taking it for 8 years and it has a long half-life….48–72 hours and at LEAST a month for it to leave your body and then you have to deal with PAWS “Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome” which is basically all psychological withdrawal, which is much harder to deal with.
As I’ve said and others, I wouldn’t do it, but if you do, don’t use Xanax, if you can help it. It’s one of, if not THE strongest Benzodiazepine there is. Clonazepam would be much better, if you wanted to try a Benzo.
It’s too bad that doctors abused it since the ‘80’s, but started to peak in 1998 - 2008 where benzo related rehab tripled in that time period and now it just hurts the people who need it, so if at all possible, try other medications that aren’t scheduled substances.
Gabapentin is a much better choice. Ironically, it’s banned unless you have a prescription in Kentucky. Anyway, it’s used to treat OCD along with an SSRI anti-depressant, but Gabapentin has side effects too, but I’d start there if you haven’t already tried it.",OCD
476,"It can, but there are many other frontline medications that would need to be tried before most would write them out. SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, are just a few.
Most people who I know don’t get Xanax. The benzodiazepine most prescribed seems to be Klonopin because it has a longer half-life in the body, so it can work longer at lower doses, and it has less of a problem with dependency.",OCD
477,"If you are not getting the results you want from your drugs, definitely talk to your psychiatrist. If you have ideas for treatments or treatment modifications, always present them---having a doctor who is willing to listen and consider your ideas is important.
Whether or not they are good ideas or useful is not something your doctor can unilaterally decide, however they are not obligated to go with your plan just because it was your idea. If you have convincing evidence of particular things being useful for you, explain that to your doctor and see what happens.
Benzodiazepines are not unserious drugs, and have risks that can last indefinitely after you take your first dose. That does not differ, in some respects, from antidepressants or antipsychotics, but the more drugs and drug classes you try, the more likely you are to experience significant side effects or withdrawal syndromes.
Since your psychiatrist has no idea why you have OCD, I suggest pursuing professional input that can help you understand why you might have it, if there is such a person. These drugs are not good for your body or brain, and if you do not sort out the OCD sooner or later, the risks of taking drugs continuously for long periods of time are heightened compared to the still-significant risks of taking them short term.
I've heard a lot of people say that benzodiazepines are not very helpful for OCD forms of anxiety, but some people also say it works alright, or helps them meaningfully. There is no singular and representative instance of a diagnosis like OCD, depression, or psychosis, so what works for you may differ, and what side effects you experience are personal to your unique psychology, physiology, mental state, history, and environment.
Also make sure you have eliminated the common physical causes of chronic anxiety, like hormonal disorders, nutritional deficiencies, abnormal growth or development, system conditions like autoimmune disorders or allergies, etc.",OCD
478,"Bummer that you haven't found a treatment that's working for you, that sucks.
I think you should talk to your psychiatrist about what he/she thinks should be the next step. Of course it's fair game to suggest whatever you want, but I'd start out with letting them suggest what they think is the best next move and having them explain why they think that.
I know benzodiazepines have been studied in the treatment of OCD, but I'm not a psychiatrist and I don't know the literature regarding any specifics. So your doctor might well feel that a trial of an adjunctive scheduled or prn benzodiazepine would be worth a shot, or they might not for some reason, I don't know!
Best wishes with all this stuff!",OCD
479,It will stop the anxiety which fuels the thoughts so yes the thoughts won’t bother you. Unfortunately benzodiazepines like Xanax are highly addictive and a bitch to get off of. They don’t cure the anxiety disorder and over time more will be needed to get the same result. I think they have a place in helping those with OCD but only occasionally as an emergency bailout when necessary. I have a friend with OCD who became addicted to Xanax. It stopped working as well so he tried to get off of it. The withdrawals were so bad he ended up committing suicide.,OCD
480,"No, not at all.
Being a neat, clean person is generally ego-syntonic, meaning it feels good to be that way.
Having OCD is an extremely internally painful, miserable state, and the people are not attempting to be neat. When that happens, it is an attempt to ward off horrendous anxiety.
Being a neat person and having a neat household is healthy.
Having OCD is not.",OCD
481,"NO ! I am a neat and organized person. It does not make me suffer. It gives me pleasure and satisfaction to have living spaces which are attractive and functional.
People with OCD suffer greatly from their symptoms. They feel like prisoners in their own world and also feel guilty and miserable. This is a serious mental illness that also effects the person’s family or whoever lives with them. Many end up alone because their attempts to ward off their anxiety are so intrusive and all consuming.",OCD
482,"No. Neatness is not obsessive compulsive disorder. This is why diagnosis should be left to professionals and not people who are under the impression that being tidy must be a sign of OCD.
OCD is a debilitating disorder that comes in several different forms including hoarding, cleaning, and picking. It directly interferes with the person's ability to function. It is a living nightmare for people who have it.",OCD
483,"Imagine for second you have driven home and you are now shaking and terrified because you think you have run someone down. You spend the next two hours going back and forth over the route checking. At home that night you still cannot shake the feeling you have killed someone and are distraught.
Or:
Imagine for second that you have opened a cupboard in your kitchen and see God’s severed head and feel his blood spraying over your body. You spend the next hour washing your body repeatedly until the skin starts breaking down. And still you do not feel clean….you daily life has become a nightmare.
Just two examples of the many varied presentations of clinical OCD. Don’t confuse OCD with the everyday use of the term eg. ‘he’s a bit OCD’. Oh and OCD is not a disease it is a psychological disorder that can be treated very successfully with psychological interventions primarily Exposure Therapy.",OCD
484,"No. OCD occurs when the need for neatness makes it difficult or impossible to carry out the ordinary activities of daily living. If neatness doesn’t get in the way of ordinary activities, then it isn’t OCD. However, reasonable people can have different ideas about what the ordinary activities of life are.",OCD
485,"OCD isn’t fake, it is very much a real disorder that disrupts one’s daily life.
I have Trichotillomania. Trichotillomania frequently co-occurs with obsessive compulsive disorder and is considered OC spectrum disorder.
I compulsively pick at my skin, scabs, and ingrown hairs. The urge to pluck and pick occurs with heightened anxiety or disruptions in my daily routines.
I’ve spent countless hours picking and plucking for as long as I can remember. This can interfere with obligations I have, as I can get carried away for minutes or even hours. This also causes shame as I have so many scars on my body, particularly my legs and ankles.
Notice my legs? I have to put bandages on certain wounds that have become deep and painful as a way to deter myself from picking.
I’ve been picking at these for almost two months now.
I keep tweezers on me at all times. This both alleviates some anxiety but triggers me to pick and pluck.",OCD
486,No it’s an anxiety disorder. It’s very painful. Those that like things clean and orderly sometimes say things like I’m a little OCD. They are not. It’s not a funny thing to those who suffer from it.,OCD
487,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

489,"Here's a secret: a common myth surrounds OCD. People with OCD like to be clean. They like to wash their hands. Or they like things organized.
The truth is none of this is accurate.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts and the resulting anxiety. OCD is asking a question and wants absolute certainty, when in reality absolute certainty doesn't exist.
Example:
A person has a consistent recurrent thought that they will get very sick if they aren't careful. And this thought is loud, repetitive, and strong. The OCD says, “I know you wasahed your hands, but did you get everything?” Your rational brain will say of course, but OCD wants certainty. So they wash them again. And again. But the OCD brain isn't getting the certainty it wants. So your hands may be clean(for now), but what about the kitchen? And after that, are you sure your hands are clean enough?
It's the OCD loop. Started with an intrusive thought and maintained via a compulsion.
It's a terrible loop to be caught in, because your rational brain can't seem to convince the OCD.
The person isn't cleaning because they like things tidy. OCD isn't fun.
The key to recovery is learning to live with the idea you can never give the OCD the certainty it wants. You learn to live daily with the uncomfort that results from that, instead of performing a compulsion.",OCD
490,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) that an individual feels driven to perform. In the context of your mom's behavior of excessive cleaning, this could indicate several things in psychology:
Compulsive Behavior: The need to clean repeatedly may be a compulsion aimed at reducing anxiety or preventing a feared event (e.g., dirtiness or germs). People with OCD often engage in these behaviors to alleviate distress caused by obsessive thoughts.
Fear of Contamination: Many individuals with OCD have specific obsessions related to cleanliness or fear of contamination. This can lead to excessive cleaning as a way to cope with those fears.
Perfectionism: Some people with OCD may have perfectionistic tendencies, feeling that their environment must be spotless or organized in a certain way. This can drive compulsive cleaning behaviors.
Coping Mechanism: Cleaning might serve as a coping mechanism for stress or anxiety. Engaging in familiar activities can provide a temporary sense of control and relief.
Functional Impairment: If the cleaning behavior is excessive to the point that it interferes with daily functioning or relationships, it may be indicative of OCD or another related anxiety disorder.
If your mom's cleaning habits are significantly impacting her life, it might be beneficial for her to speak with a mental health professional who can provide a proper assessment and support. Treatment options such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication can be effective in managing OCD.",OCD
491,"She might have OCD, or she could have Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). There is a big difference--people OCD feel unhappy about the repetitive behaviors, they feel that they are prisoners of these thoughts and urges.
Someone with OCPD is totally different, they love their methods and they do not think the behaviors are a problem.
So the display of behaviors could be the same, but the important factor is how the person feels and perceives the situation. In OCD, the symptoms are in conflict with the person's personality and desires. In OCPD, the symptoms are in sync with the person's personality and values.",OCD

However, if she doesn't like to do it but does it anyway, or does other obsessive things, or does cleaning at other people's homes, or in cafeterias, or injures or exhausts herself doing it on a regular basis, then she might want to seek help.

First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems.

A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your head scream and stand in the moment until the pain subsides. This proves to yourself that you are capable of restraining yourself. You have free will, and you will conquer. This is called Exposure Therapy. Face your fears, and prove yourself right.

Finally, I want to end this with saying: You are not your compulsions. You are a strong human being. You can and you will do this, because you deserve a beautiful life and everything you have to offer. You don’t deserve to be a prisoner of your own illness. If there’s anything that exposure therapy has proven me, it’s that the fear/anxiety/urges and whatnot’s that comes out of not doing my compulsions, is that it always goes away after about 30–45 seconds. The most extreme part of a panic attack subsides after 15 minutes. It is not humanly possible to be at the top at the curve of a panic attack for more than 15 minutes. It may still be uncomfortable. But your worst panic symptoms will always fade after 15 minutes. You will never die off an anxiety or panic attack. And every time you reach the top of the curve, the top is further down then it was the last time you were at the top of your curve. And eventually the top of the curve will be like any other “Uh oh or hell no’s” you experience with other things that makes you feel iffy. Everyone has OCD to some extend, but they usually forget about the intrusive thought and go about their normal lives. You will finally reach this target if you work hard enough. Accept your fears. Don’t work against them, but also don’t allow them to happen. Tell yourself that it’s ok to fell this way. That this isn’t you, but it still makes you afraid, and that is okay. Everyone is afraid of something, and this, right here, right now, is making you scared or anxious. The sooner you accept this, the easier and faster you will learn to overcome it. It’s much easier to get out of a hell house if you’ve accepted that there’s a rabid serial killer trying to kill you. you will remain level headed, you will not freak out and you will find solutions to your problems. And finally, there you found the exit. On to the next problem.
So come on, let your beautiful self be able to control you!

If she has an obsession, let her be at peace about it and occupy yourself iwth other things rather than being obsessed about her obsession. Accept her for what she is and do not try changing it- she has committed herself to something (even if that be to clean the house). Let her have her moments of peace doing it, rather than fracturing your own, and her peace of mind.

498,"Normal compulsion cleaning behavior refers to a tendency to keep one's surroundings clean and tidy as a matter of personal preference or habit. True OCD cleaning behavior, on the other hand, is characterized by excessive cleaning and grooming rituals that are driven by intense anxiety or fear and take up excessive amounts of time, interfering with daily life. These compulsions are often irrational or excessive, and the person may feel compelled to perform them despite not wanting to. Additionally, true OCD cleaning behavior can be distressing and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

499,"There is more to OCD than just being a ‘clean freak’. OCD is an anxiety disorder that causes obsessive and intrusive thoughts that can only be temporarily relieved by compulsions.
If you are a ‘clean freak' it could be because you are simply passionate about, and have respect for, your possessions. It is only considered OCD if it is making you ill or having too distracting an influence on your daily life.
The difference between a passion and an obsession is that a passion fuels the soul and re-energises you, whereas an obsession is an unhealthy habit that is actually draining your energy. However, society likes to stereotype and label anything that isn't considered normal an obsession, or something bad - when in actual fact, to that person - it could be deeply rewarding and fulfilling.
Life is about doing what you love and being who you are, not doing what society tells you you should be doing or what it thinks is wrong or right for you. If your cleanliness makes you happy and you aren't doing it out of fear, then it's not an illness and should be fully embraced.",OCD
500,"More or less it's interlinking. People often step towards something that they have been believing or something are having faith into. Spontaneously along, time has drawn them towards their faith ideology rather than the capacity to find the reasons.It has been speculated that superstitiousness and obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) exist along a continuum. we can differentiate superstitious behavior from superstitious belief, or magical ideation. Different brain circuits are responsible for these two forms of superstitiousness; thus, determining which type of superstition is prominent in the symptomatology of an individual patient may inform us about the primarily affected neurocognitive systems. And coming back to OCD Dysfunction of this neural circuitry is prominent in patients with OCD and OC-spectrum disorders. It is responsible for behavioral routines, whose stereotypy and irrationality is typically recognized by the patient. Nonetheless, recognition of the senselessness of the repetitive motor displays does not enable a patient to break the routine. Significantly, whether superstitiously motivated or not, perseveration is an almost defining feature of an obsessive-compulsive ritual.",OCD

502,"The difference between superstitious thinking and OCD is both small and large, it depends first of the intensity. The OCD patient has no choice about his obsessions, they disrupt daily life often to a point they simply can no longer have a typical life.
the OCD patient does feel the terrible anxiety of a danger looming but is rarely able to explain what the fear is about while the rituals develop to prevent those catastrophic events. OCD is a very serious mental condition which can show in children quite early, sometimes before they can fully express how they feel.
superstitious thinking has a general understanding that completing an act, looking at the black cat may engage fatal outcomes, but once the element out. of sight, the individual is able to continue a typical life until the next event.
The two situations can converge if the superstitious thinking become obsessive and the patient develop rituals beyond the throwing a bit of salt above the shoulder when tipping the salt shakers, and develop increasing fears and overbearing rituals.
The two are essentially different by their intensity, weight on daily life and capacity in ST to grow out of them, which does happen eventually with some.",OCD
503,"I have a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.
I am also a therapist.
People who are diagnosed with OCD suffer from extreme anxiety and extreme fear and use rituals often associated with superstitions in order to feel safe from imagined threats.
The purpose of the rituals is positive to the sufferer as they believe if they do something to try and stop their perceived danger they will not be harmed.
They will do anything from not stepping on a sidewalk crack to avoid breaking their mother’s back to obsessive handwashing where they will count to a specific number before they will stop washing their hands.
If they miss a number they will start over which can result in hours of hand washing.
The energy they exert doing their rituals makes them believe it is the ritual and not the energy exerted while doing the ritual that causes their anxiety and fear to dissipate.
Anxiety medication and therapy are indicative of a good outcome.",OCD
504,"There is no connection between the two.
Superstition means to be in expectation of future misfortune and the person who has often wished others ill (but who, in the name of his:/ her own education, has managed to repress these wishes in the unconscious), will be particularly inclined to live in perpetual fear that misfortune will strike him/her (as punishment for his unconscious wickedness). Superstition has its roots in repressed* tendencies of a hostile and cruel character (unconscious for people).
OCD is generated by powerful and unconscious feelings of guilt**. In an attempt to stop/remove the anguish that this unconscious guilt produces, people who are in this case, engage in behaviors such as OCD (against their will). But this appeasement that OCD produces is only an illusion, since the anguish resurfaces sooner or later. We know what happens next: the person renews his or her OCD, the anguish reappears and so on.... At least until the person who is affected by OCD does some work on him/herself.
*Repression is an unconscious process
**Present in all neurosis. ←This last term is always used in psychoanalysis.",OCD
505,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

506,"I’ll just list a few that I’ve encountered.
People with OCD are clean freaks/perfectionists. That has nothing to do with OCD.
OCD is helpful since it makes you cleaner. Ask someone with extreme anxiety about germs if they feel like it’s “helpful.”
People with OCD hate anything out of order, it ‘triggers’ them. If you’re bothered by something not fitting into a pattern, congratulations; a lot of people feel the same way, and it’s not OCD. Of course things out of order can upset people with OCD, but it’s not everything all the time, it’s specific to each person. For instance, I have to have all products in my house turned facing away from my eye line or they’ll get contaminated.
If a person with OCD was bothered by these cookies there wouldn’t be a simple fix like with people without OCD. If someone without OCD were to turn the one cookie to match the rest, they would feel relief. Everything is back in order. As for someone with OCD, there would be no relief from that action. They might even have to turn it many, many times until it’s ‘right.’ And still, it doesn’t relieve anything. It’s so much more complicated than just not liking the look of disorder.
A lot of OCD is a battle fought inside the mind. I don’t think a lot of people grasp that. There’s awful intrusive thoughts that you can’t stop, so much guilt, self-doubt, turmoil, and a buttload of worry.",OCD
507,"I think the idea of religion = psychological disorder is a fallacy.
The idea of a deity came about as a result of humanity's drive to know Why. If we couldn't figure out an explanation based on the world around us, we filled in the gap with ""deity did it"".
Religion is the institutionalization of the worship of that deity. In my opinion, it came about because humans like things orderly and repeatable. Codifying worship with religion made it neat, orderly and easy to hand down to other generations.
I'm not saying that there aren't mentally unstable people who are religious; there are just as many who are irreligious. But being religious isn't the sign of an unstable mind.",OCD

510,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder refers to a mental condition where the daily life of a person interferes with recurring thoughts and actions. The thoughts that occur are uncontrollable which are called obsessions and the behavior which is followed by these thoughts is called compulsions. In the daily life of a person, he/she encounters various such thoughts by they are not likely to interfere with the daily routine. When the situation gets out of hand, the person must start to worry. An example of this situation would be washing hands 80–100 times a day so that you don't catch any skin infection. Now washing hands and maintaining personal hygiene is not bad but the amount of time wasted in such actions is worrisome.
People experience various obsessions and companions. It is not necessary to experience both of them. One can be obsessed with thoughts and not with compulsions. so, they can occur separately. When this condition becomes severe, it starts to interfere with relationships and responsibilities and reduces the quality of life. OCD is not anybody’s fault and the person doesn't have to deal with it alone. Its a treatable illness and can be cured with or without medication. With therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is used to treat OCD along with light medication. However, CBT has been considered the most effective method for its treatment. CBT addresses the irrational thoughts and fear to lessen anxiety, and the therapist helps the person to adjust their thoughts which affects their actions. Every available treatment does not work for everyone. Some might get relief from therapy and some from medications, some may require both of them and others may require different forms of therapies. It varies from person to person. However, some people with OCD can be permanently cured after treatment. Others may still show the symptoms but in a lesser amount. Other treatments can be used with OCD, such as habit reversal where one ritual is replaced with something less severe, Suppression helps in switching off the symptoms and Satiation, which involves prolonged exposure to the symptom. OCD is treatable. It isn't something to be fearful of. Knowledge of OCD is one the main key to dealing with mental illness and lead a better quality of life.",OCD
511,"It can be cured
First of all let me clear this there is no cure for many other diseases like if you had a heart attack there will always be a chance that you'll get it if you don't take proper medicine fpr a life time . So it goeswith OCD actually its a lie because phichiatrist want patient they can not live with out them so they make excuses like taking medicine will help you .
Actually you don't even need a medicine if you want you can take it'll help you there is no shame about 10 in every 50 americans take anti depressants soo everyone has something that disturbs them for ocd patients its just a myth that they have categorized it in ocd it can be cure i mean it is literally very easy but hard to accept as you would have heard from people that when i want to forget something it comes back … So do everyone have OCD ? Noo may you also don't have it. Step to over come it easily it takes time may be 10 days not more .
Whe you get the thought accept it yeah its ohk am doing it just go through every where your mind takes you .
When the thought pops up by anything just say ohk yeah right . (Deep inside you know you have full control over your mind) soo just go with the flow and i garanty you that thought will vanish . And if after some time it hits you repeat the process.
Don't be to scared by what if ? What if? Because you won't do anything you are a normal human being and no matter how bad is your thought everyone would really have thought about it once in there life so its not outta this world .
Face your fear ohk ? Don't ever fight with I knoe it won't be easy because you will think may be I'll be the way you r thinking right now but blve me you will be normal .
The main point about OCD your mind wants you not to fear so just don't fear accept it . There's nothing what you think is going to happen .
Now you are free from it so just be calm ,write and memorize every point that is against your thought that why you shouldn't think about it . Why it is not right to do or to think about it .
It can be cured treatment and cure are the same things every health issue can come back So don't worry treatment is itself a cure . It just disturbing the number of times it comes back is more . And am sure when you'll get the key that accept it that'll be a joke to you after words like how foolish i was . Hope not out :)",OCD
512,"No just having medicines for treating any physiological and psychological problems is not enough , because medicines are not permanent cure for any ailments , it gives temporary relief , but yes few health problems solved by just taking medicines if our immunity is strong , we are strong . Medicines have side effects too , which give birth to another new physiological problems.
Hence , some people with obsessive compulsive disorder can be completely cured after treatment . Treatment typically employ both medications , lifestyle changes including behavioral modification therapy , cognitive therapy , yoga exercises , meditation and nutrition therapy.
Psychological disorders and some physiological health problems are due to imbalance of harmones functions , due to social factors , due to genetic factors , due to side effects of medicines , due to intoxication of drugs , alcohol or it may be results of some horrible accidents in life or during brain surgery .
Researchers says that OCD , obsessive compulsive disorder is triggered by communication problem between brain deeper structure and front part of brain . These parts of brain primarily use serotonin to communicate , this is why increasing level of serotonin in brain aggravate OCD symptoms.
Symptoms of OCD ----
Fear of contamination by germs or by dirt .
Worry about discarding things or things having no value .
Fear of losing control and harming yourself or others .
Violent thoughts and images , Anxiety , insomnia .And may be others too .
Healthy lifestyle , that is regular walking or cycling or swimming , yoga exercises , pranayaam , meditation , hypnosis , nutritious food and sufficient water help to solve many many health problems .

513,"In my experience the symptoms of OCD can completely be managed through medication. I suffered from it since early childhood and was prescribed Prozac in my 20s. My symptoms disappeared for the first time in my life. Twenty years later, I no longer take medication. I don’t know if others have had this experience, or if I am a rare case. I feel very blessed to have had a good doctor who encouraged me to not be afraid to give medications a try.",OCD
514,"In my experience it depends on the particular TYPE of OCD. Obsessive thoughts, obsessive hand-washing, and whatnot might be different from, say, skin-picking.
A lot of OCD is an anxiety disorder stemming from unresolved phobias that are best treated with cognitive behavioral therapy. Others are a symptom of anxiety period.
In my case my OCD manifested itself in being a worry-wart (constantly imagining the worst-case scenario in every situation) and therapy was helpful in that case. But I also, (and still do) suffer from “picking.” Mostly the ears and nose. I can dig and dig and dig but the “phantom itch” in my nose and ears that I pick at never seems to unearth anything. No boogers, no ear-critters, just a terrible compulsion to pick at both of those orifices with no reward of finding the cause of the offending itch. It was maddening.
In that case clomipramine (Anafranil) worked wonders. It stopped the compulsive behavior. I asked about it after I had picked at my nose so badly I wound up with blood all over the front of my shirt.
The unfortunate byproduct of this medication is - and it manifests in almost every male who takes it - anorgasmia. In laymen’s terms: no matter how hard you try you cannot have an orgasm. Talk about frustrating.
I have sometimes gotten my “picking” to lessen by having a few beers or taking anti-anxiety meds such Klonopin but these are both just as habit-forming as the picking itself.
But the answer is yes, there are medications that can help one get certain TYPES of OCD under control. You just have to figure out if your particular type of OCD is a product of a phobia (fear of germs, fear of letting things go aka “hoarding”) or a product of repetitive behaviors that seem to make no sense, such as trichotillomania or skin-picking or as in my case, a compulsive impulse to try and remove “phantom boogers” which are not present",OCD
515,"That is a simple question, but the answer is complicated.
First of all: it depends. There are different “types” and “levels” of OCDs. For some, it causes only mild discomfort and occurs infrequently (e.g. due to stressful life events) - while for others, it is a life debilitating condition, with accompanying diseases such as anxiety, Tourette’s, clinical depression, etc.
I guess you have asked this question because you have “serious” OCD that requires attention.
The bad news is that more often than not, OCD cannot be “cured” - meaning it is a permanent condition that will stay with you with the rest of your life. It rarely just “disappears”.
The good news is, however, that this disease usually responds well to treatment. It might take months or even years, but with advanced drugs and new approaches in therapy, it can usually be managed very well, greatly enhancing the quality of life of the sufferer, with only occasional relapses.
In case of significant discomfort, medications (such us SSRI-s) are often given early, for a longer periods of time (6+ months). Some might need to take them for (many) years, but often - with the help of psychotherapy -, as the general condition of the sufferer improves, and he or she learns to manage the disease, they can be discontinued, even permanently.
Note: I am not a doctor. If you have a condition, consult a professional! YMMV.",OCD
516,"Most of the answer depends on your OCD and the medication. Is the medication you take targets the cause. Usually OCD isn't permanent. It is off and on. Hopefully you will learn what can set it off so you can avoid it.
The medications may be explored on a trial and error basis. I know it can run in families. What works for one often works for other family members.
I don't think it can be cured but even bad cases can be managed. I know one guy who had to flap his armsike wings if he sat down. That ended when he sought professional help. Because of OCD he didn't want help.",OCD
517,"Medication doesn't cure it, it masks it, but that doesn't mean you can't learn to live with these things. Therapy helps, CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) helps, mindfulness exercises help also.
Ocd especially can not be fully cured, but it can be managed. As for anxiety and depression, those could be limited, you can over come depression, but it could also be temporary, it all depends on the severity of it all.
As for documentation I wouldn't know, I do research in my own time, but haven't seen anything on fully getting over ocd. Maybe I've seen things on anxiety and depression, but when it comes to ocd sufferers, all the articles are usually about how to manage it/ live with it.",OCD
518,"Medication alone won't cure anxiety or depression. What it will do is give you a reprieve from them so that you are able to start confronting your fears, work through your depression, perhaps find the motivation to get counselling or therapy and work through some of the underlying issues if necessary. They will allow you to create new patterns and habits of daily living. The brain and body are an open system. Meaning depression leads to behaviours associated with depression (same with anxiety) and acting in these behaviours (isolating, sleeping in etc) reinforces depression. The opposite is true with happiness and connection. Doing things, taking chances, meeting people etc reinforces connection and happiness. We are social animals by nature. So medications can lift you enough to start behaviours and actions which can lead to happiness and a lessening of fear (anxiety). This is true generally from my personal experience and research, however there may be people who are chronically low or imbalances in specific brain chemicals attributed to mood. If after altering their life and behaviours and working through their “stuff"" they still feel anxious or lousy, it could be a chronic condition requiring medication for life. Medication alone temporarily won't fix anxiety or depression in either case.",OCD
519,"Hi sweetheart. Of course you can. I am at the end of my Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT), and it has worked wonders. I have almost no OCD left.
The one thing that people misunderstand with this treatment is that they tell you that you will never recover completly. Well, they’re wrong. Let’s say that your OCD is 100%, mine is now 20%, and the average normal person is 5%.
Everybody has 5% in terms that everybody get intrusive thoughts now and then, and everyone has the feelinh that “Ugh, it’s not good enough. Better do it one more time.” The difference is that they don’t bother with the self loathing. They just do it, or just ignore those intrusive thoughts like anything else or think it’s rather funny that they were capable of thinking of drowning their friend in anger. That is where we come in. We never let it go, or vi so our compulsions until our hands are raw and bleeding. We feel like we are forced to, instead of feeling that it would be good to to it.
So, no one is 0% OCD. And you need to remember that. This will help you. Because you will get urges and thoughts like everyone else, but with the list under you will also learn how to ignore those thoughts and go about your day as everyone else. 5% is good. Embrace your 5%, okay?
Now. How to get to 5%?
First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems. The best treatment is Exposure and response prevention (ERP) and Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT). Because if you do try to overcome this alone, you will relapse multiple times resulting in a worse relapse every time. I can speak on behalf of my self and thousands of other people with OCD or compulsive behavior.
Second you should make a private list of your goals and then work it out together with your appointed doctor. The list should include:
* Why do I want this?
* Who am I doing it for? (The answer should ALWAYS be yourself, but you have to mean it a 100%)
* A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
* Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
* Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
* Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
* As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
* Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
* If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
* Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your...

520,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
521,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

522,"You are not your mind, your thoughts, or your senses, you are the one in control of them, they are the ones influencing you to do karma in this world.
Spiritual thought, isn't it?
Wait.
I will give you a perspective.
It's midnight, you went to the kitchen to get some hot water, you switched on the stove, and after putting the water in the jug, you switched off the stove.
Wait, did you switch it off?
What if it isn't switched off?
Certain death for the one who lights the stove in the morning.
You check it again. It's shut.
Your mind refuses to believe your eyes, wisdom and sensory inputs.
What if this is the on-button and not the off-button? Your basics get shattered.
You switch it on again and then switch it off and confirm the off button.
Wait, did I switch it off or not? Your mind brings another thought.
You keep repeating the act out of fear and confusion.
How did you manage to defy a simple logic?
It's powerful negative thoughts.
You are reacting to the negative thoughts and not on logic, facts or your input receptors.
How to correct yourself?
Say to yourself-
“This is the correct way to shut the stove, I did it right now. There's no gas or flame now, I am done. Any insecure confused thought is the negative child born out of my mind. These thoughts are compulsive and incorrect, not my actions, I trust my actions. There's no threat.”
You would still have some doubts at that moment, but when you practice this habit, you slowly numb these thoughts.
The critical points here are-
Recognizing the completion, the end, I did it, it's complete now, no need to check or repeat any further. Whenever you complete any task, keep your focus on the endpoint and realise that you did it, you can say that to yourself and feel relaxed.
Recognising thoughts as compulsive thoughts and not the wisdom of your mind. “I have OCD and these thoughts are a result of it, they are false and trying to conquer my mind, I should let them pass and believe in reality and my acts.” Once you learn to differentiate, you recognise and keep yourself separate from such thoughts, they would cause the anxious fight or flight response, but if you are clear and determined, they slowly fade away and you can focus on other things. The more you practise lower the potency of these thoughts becomes.
Reducing fear in your mind. Accepting death as the ultimate reality, accepting diseases, mistakes and losses as an inseparable part of life, having faith in your ability to cope with the downs of life, and realizing that bad events are not the factory settings of life, they are not prominent than normal or good events, live a little casual and free life. You can afford to not be perfect.
Try to identify yourself as the wisdom controlling your life, and stay separate from the body, life, world and your mind and thoughts, you have to control them or they shall control you. Controlling them is really difficult and needs practice and momentary suffering in form of anxiety or panic, but it's for the overall betterment of your life. Start the pursuit to conquer your mind now.
Don't feel shy or delay. Get professional treatment if it's getting over your mind.

523,"Within 15 minutes you can easily get rid of OCD. Don't believe ? :-)
India is a mysterious land….
As an Indian i will answer you according to the observations and experiences of our people from the ancients to our present ones.
Be patient first of all …. OCD wasnt born in the 21st century.
Solution—
Meditation.
Meditation, as sought by many (non indians) is closing the eyes and sitting in padmasana. This is wrong. It is interpreted just like kung-fu which is not just waving fists in air, its a way of life and more. Meditation is much more.
Meditation means concentrative thinking on one, only one ,just one subject like taking a showel and digging on a point inside your mind.
Now how does that relate to OCD ?
Meditation can do wonders. If you are suffering from OCD of say, anything; you can easily get rid of it in 15 minutes just as I said already.
What you need to do is:
Go to any place of peace. CHURCH/TEMPLE/MOSQUE/GURDWARA are all very good but believe me, your room is the best place.
Start with “om”( like ooooooooom) for first 2 minutes.
Now just tell your brain that you have decided to get over your compulsions.
Think about the thing/person/thought/object.
Keep exploring it.
It won't be long before you start realising that you yourself are more important than that object.
That, you deserve more as you soar higher into your inner self and that that thing/object/thought is imperfect and has quite low value in your life and that you have higher priorities ;however it is not bad. Still not good, not the best .
End it all with 30 seconds of “oooom”(rhymes with dome not doom).
This all will not take more than 15 minutes.
And when you get up, you will realise that you are someone better than before and that you are ready to avoid the compulsion.
Sounds very simple, isn't it, you may think it might have only a little credibility . Simplicity has its own highs first of all. Secondly, try it and you will surely reach there.
I guarantee you.",OCD
524,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
525,"Honestly, one of the worst things a person with OCD can do is go it alone and keep holding their fears in. I’ll explain more in a second. But first, let me give some context.
At the worst of my OCD I’d spend every morning crying at my doorstep after checking my locks, my kitchen stove, my windows, my electronics, my dryer, my hair straightener, and anything else that popped into my head for the twentieth time. I’d be an hour late to work and I felt utterly trapped between my fear and my obligations. I’d be scared to leave my place for anything due to an unnatural fear that even the smallest incident might alter my life horribly. I begged and pleaded my brain to stop obsessing over stuff at 3am so that I could have some semblance of sleep. I was terrified that one inconsequential moment could set off any number of chain reactions that could be the end of it for me or someone else. I was too afraid to talk to anyone for fear that they might exploit my anxiety. And I closed myself off from the world.
How I overcame it:
I opened up and I started talking to others about it. By just asking a family member or friend to listen, I was able to hear my thoughts out loud and figure out what was rational and truly irrational.
I’d find anything to distract myself when it got overwhelming, and I did it until I was sufficiently distracted. (Btw, puzzles and Legos are great for people with racing minds who need something to concentrate on…)
I picked up more hobbies to keep my mind preoccupied. (I now design houses for the hell of it.)
It was nearly impossible, but I started learning to clear my head. Not in a meditation way because that never really worked for me. My go to was to say “It doesn’t really matter right now,” over and over. I still can’t believe that worked. But I knew shutting down my anxious thoughts outright might make my OCD worse. So I made my mind postpone those thoughts anytime they came up – until they fizzled out completely. (Most of the time too, repeating that in my head with emphasis would make me really tired and I would fall asleep after a bit.)
I was encouraged by family and friends to remind myself of my qualifications. So I’d recite them when I felt unsure of myself and it helped me build my self-confidence.
I started focusing more on others and listening to their stories. Not just ones about anxiety though, but good stories, bad stories, funny stories, emotional stories, and exciting stories.
I learned to be happy for and focus on others even when I was feeling completely overwhelmed and depressed. Seeing the good that was happening to others as something to celebrate helped me see even the smallest successes and opportunities that I had.
Whatever you’re going through, just know what you’re not alone. Wishing you all the best in your journey!",OCD
526,"There are some general strategies that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often find helpful. However, it's essential to consult with a mental health professional.
Here are some coping strategies:
1.Seek Professional Help: Reach out to a therapist or counselor experienced in treating OCD. They can provide you with guidance, support, and evidence-based therapies.
2.Educate yourself: Knowing the mechanisms behind the disorder can help you develop coping strategies.
3.Manage Stress: Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as regular exercise, engaging in hobbies, practicing relaxation techniques, and getting enough sleep.
4.Challenge Obsessions: Work with your therapist to identify and challenge the irrational beliefs or obsessions that fuel your compulsive behaviors.
5.Limit Rituals Gradually: Instead of quitting compulsive behaviors cold turkey, try to gradually reduce the frequency and intensity of your rituals. This process can be done in collaboration with your therapist.
6.Create a Support System: Share your struggles with friends and family who can provide encouragement.
Remember that OCD is a treatable condition, and with the right support and strategies, you can manage its impact on your life.

527,"I do not know your situation, nor if you truly do suffer from OCD, or some other disorder. I am not a psychologist, and what I am saying should not be construed as medical advice. But I'll share with you how I overcame it, and hopefully that will be enlightening.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is what made my symptoms minimize nearly to nothing.
I was driving my my head through a wall (figuratively) as well as my fists and feet (literally) trying to figure out how to stop the intrusive thoughts from taking over my life from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning, to the moment I fell asleep at night. Sometimes, the thoughts and obsessions manifested themselves in my dreams as well.
It took me 7 years of being locked in my room, failing through classes in high school, dodging social interactions and professional duties, trying with every ounce of strength I had to straighten my mind out, before I realized there was a fundamentally simple answer to the problem:
I was pushing, where I should have been pulling.
It sounds like an enigmatic answer, but it is the one that best fits the solution to my particular set of issues with OCD. I spent every waking moment of my day repressing. Pushing away horrific thoughts of violence and socially unacceptable scenarios that seemed to pop into my head at random intervals throughout the day. If you are suffering from OCD, I'm sure you don't need me to tell you the mental energy spent on keeping these thoughts at bay. I was pushing with everything I had.
Eventually I saw a therapist, who helped me try a new tactic. She had me sit down, and for an hour a day, with no outside distractions or noises, close my eyes and will the thoughts to me. She told me to welcome the thoughts in. To become okay with them. To usher them into my head, instead of waiting for them to do so. To mentally envelope myself in that which I once found repulsive. To essentially pull, where I had pushed.
The results were tangible after the first hour of employing this tactic. I felt a lightness in my head I hadn't felt since I was a child. It was as though the stress of intrusive thoughts was still there, but only as an echo. That which we are constantly exposed to becomes commonplace. And that which becomes commonplace, loses its ability to horrify us.
The intrusive thoughts came back, of course. But not as intensely. I continued to do the exercise daily, seeing stronger results each time I did so, until the thoughts became so inconsequential that I hardly noticed they were there in my daily life. I became so good at the exercise, that I started to make it comedic, and soon, what once kept me anxiously holed up in my room became something I could sincerely laugh at. That turnaround was one of the best feelings I had felt in years.
I still feel echoes of OCD from time to time. It manifests itself slightly differently, but I recognize it all the same. I sometimes fall into bouts of unrealistic anxiety. I always fall back on that exercise, and it hasn't failed me yet.
I grew up thinking that those seven years of torture were going to be my life. Now I know that that's not the case. I always thought I was alone in that fight, that no one else was experiencing what I was. It would have helped me so much if I could have had someone who understood this thing, to be there for me and tell me that it didn't have to be that way.
Seek help from a cognitive behavioral therapist. Reach out to a community who understands it. Don't give up hope.",OCD
528,"OCD means you have fear of thoughts.
To overcome 100% , just understand below things and BOOM, you are free from OCD
No need to stop the negative thoughts.
The more you want to stop it, the more they will come.
“Negative thoughts cannot do anything to your life“ , Believe me.
So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Thoughts cannot do anything.”
Just focus on taking positive actions only.
Only actions can do something. Not thoughts.
So focus on taking positive actions only.",OCD
529,"ARE YOU READY?
OK, HERE WE GO.
First things first, tackling OCD isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. I personally battled OCD for over four years, and now, I'm leading a normal life. How did I manage that? Well, let me share my story with you.
Back in 2018, OCD began to take over my life, especially because I was highly sensitive about hygiene, morality, and religion. It seized upon these aspects, even though I was driven by big dreams and ambitions. And so, the struggle began.
I became a prisoner to my feelings and urges, letting them dictate how I studied, worked, read, and did everything else. The constant barrage of intrusive thoughts brought intense anxiety, making me doubt my own beliefs and thoughts.
Even though I was aware of my OCD, I couldn't shake off those distressing thoughts. Day in and day out, I found myself ruminating, seeking reassurance, and avoiding situations. I was truly struggling. I tried resisting compulsions in various ways, exhausting myself to the point of almost tears at times.
But I wasn't interested in therapy or medications. I didn't want to merely ""manage"" my OCD and live in fear of intrusive thoughts. I craved a way for my mind to naturally brush off those unwanted thoughts and urges, so I could enjoy life uninterrupted.
I knew that resisting compulsions was the solution, but I wanted to do it in a way that didn't feel restrictive, like exposure therapy. I wanted to know what strategies people around the world were using to control their compulsions.
There had to be a method that could genuinely help me find peace and control.
Then, I stumbled upon a counselor from the Middle East who was addressing OCD in a unique way. He didn't prescribe exposure or medications like many others did. Instead, he helped people see what was happening in their minds and how to let those intrusive thoughts pass without giving in to compulsions.
I gave it a shot, and while it wasn't an instant fix, it started working over time. The severity of my OCD decreased, but there was still some struggle in resisting compulsions.
I yearned for an unbreakable mind against OCD.
So, I delved into psychology and deeply studied human thinking and behavior. I combined the counselor's approach with mindset strategies and techniques I had picked up during my journey with OCD. The result was a game-changer.
With consistent application, my OCD became significantly less severe in a short span. One day, I noticed that intrusive thoughts and urges no longer bothered me. They came and went like passing clouds, while I continued my tasks without giving them any power. Consequently, my anxiety plummeted.
I can't put into words the sense of control and peace I now experience. I can study, work, enjoy life, and be with my loved ones without any disruptions from OCD.
My mission now is to help fellow OCD sufferers worldwide achieve this level of recovery. I'm not talking about using conventional coping techniques; I'm talking about empowering individuals to a point where OCD doesn't stand a chance against them.
That's why I've developed a 3-step Method based on my experience. It guides you from where you are now to where you want to be in life, regardless of your specific OCD theme or ongoing treatment.
And here's the exciting part: This method isn't fixated on the problem; it's all about effective solutions.
I genuinely hope this method aids your recovery journey. And if you ever need help, I'm here with open arms.
Quick reminder: This isn't some magical cure that erases OCD overnight. Your results will depend on your situation, mindset, and effort.
Remember, it's your life. You hold the power to shape your day and achieve your dreams.",OCD
530,"There is no compulsive apathy . Compulsive is an action word. There is nothing compulsive about apathy. It just is. It is the feeling that everything is too much. That nothing matters. There's a strong sense of vagueness. People tend to speak less. They don't necessarily say they feel depressed or sad. They say they don't feel anything. Things that require action don't happen because they take too much thought, too much energy, too much initiative. So a person just is. They feel overwhelmed and tired out by most everything. Severe cases include people who stop attending to their activities of daily living like showing , dressing , brushing their teeth. If these people are left too long without treatment they may stop eating or drinking. In other words apathy can become worse and needs to be a warning sign that something more serious is going on.",OCD
531,"This is a very interesting question,
While falling under the same category as OCD, there does exist the lesser known condition of Compulsive Decluttering which is also referred to Compulsive Spartanism.
While OCD does contain within it diagnosis a pattern of hoarding, Compulsive Decluttering is the polar opposite and involves a distinct and perva...",OCD
532,"Well it would seem hoarding would be the opposite but like many human paradoxes, it's simular. Both are based in anxiety and fear.
OCD is trying to first, get the right answer (obsessing) and then do things perfectly (compulsive). Not being able to do either one or both, you have to keep checking over and over, driving one crazy.
You wanted the condition of NOT tolerating clean and orderly. Generally it is simply put, a teenager. Or more succinct, immaturity. Crudely, generally stated as lazy or a slob.What is the quality in this arena? Basicly it is Oppositional Defiant. People who don't like being told what to do. Cleaning tends to remind them of what they have to do and they can't relax. They hear criticism in their head, generally from a parent figure.
So the opposite of OCD is to be relaxed, to trust it will be OK, and to have faith. How one gets there has a number of factors including background, culture, religion, resources, friends, willingness to risk, and sage found. For the immaturity part, it's generally said to just grow up.",OCD
533,"This is an interesting and unique question.
I'm not sure that I can think of a ""disorder"" that is the inverse of OCD. OCD is technically an anxiety disorder, and the anxiety comes from failure to answer to the obsessive thoughts that a person has which compels them to perform certain ""rituals"" to alleviate the anxiety. The reverse of that would be someone that has some sort of disorder from not obsessing about things. That would be weird.
I may be wrong. Unless you are thinking of OCPD? In that case, the inverse would be someone that has a personality that they are averse to perfection. Something like that, maybe?",OCD
534,"Yes, there's something called OCPD, short for Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder.
I’m a psychiatrist (at ‘Mantra Care’), and I’ve come across several cases of this disorder.
So OCD is when you have intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, like constantly checking the stove or washing your hands. On the other hand, OCPD is more about a rigid need for order, perfectionism, and control.
Think of it like this: someone with OCD might feel overwhelmed by thoughts that they'll harm someone if they don't do a certain action, while someone with OCPD might have strict rules about how things should be done and get upset if others don't follow those rules.
It's kind of like opposite ends of the same spectrum.
With OCD, there's also an anxiety-driven need to control things to reduce fear, whereas with OCPD, there's a strong desire for control because it's believed things should be a certain way.
If you or anyone you know needs support for dealing with OCD, don't hesitate to reach out. You can contact me through 'Mantra Care'. I’ll be happy to help.",OCD
535,"There could be a number of physiological things going on (illness, infection, nutritional deficiencies, food or environmental allergies/sesitivities, hormonal imbalances, etc). But in terms of a mental health disorder opposite of OCD, I’d have to go with depression.
People don’t realize that one of the primary symptoms of depression includes apathy: lost interest in normal activities. Depression also has other apathy-associated symptoms of possible fatigue, lethargy, lessened concentration, and sleep and eating disruptions and often results in social withdrawal and couch potato or other apathetic behavior.
If you are experiencing debilitating apathy, it sounds like a trip to the doctor is in order. You will probably want to get some blood work done, as well as be screened for mild or moderate depression.",OCD
536,"I googled this question myself not as someone who suffers from OCD but as someone who suffers from Adult ADD and has been curious about how it seems like a stark contrast to the way my mind works. I am not a detail oriented person, I never fixate on small details, if I fixate on an idea it is not linear but more of a desire to unlock a general understanding of it. From my experience people with OCD tendencies usually fixate on the environment around them. Although I am observant I don't really fixate on the environment. My mind's autopilot just seems to be on. Like I am not actively trying to take stock of the environment more like my brain is doing that for me behind the scenes. The only thing that I will generally be actively aware of more often than not is the emotional environment of the people around me. I seem to pick up on how they are feeling quicker than most people but it's not because I am taking a tally on their mannerisms or facial expressions but rather that the automatic nature of my sensory preception provides me the ability to be aware of this without fully understanding all of the underlying details. Even knowing logically how important routine is for our mental and physical health it is one of my hardest struggles to try and create it in my own life. My brain seems to rebel against it. I guess to summarize it is almost as if my subconscious goes through the day taking in information and sorts it through a filter like; Is this something that could harm me or something I want very badly. If it doesn't check either of those boxes then the information is dismissed regardless of how important it might actually be in reality.",OCD
537,"According to many at the American Psychiatric association. ADHD is the opposite of OCD.
They are starting to see many psychiatric conditions as a spectrum. On one end of this spectrum they see OCD, in a person who is extremely vigilant and obsessive about perfection, and overthinking on the other end of the spectrum is ADHD, where the patient will rush through and act without thinking.
I think this is incorrect and ADHD and OCD are not related. OCD is a result of a chemical imbalance in the brain where the sufferer has intrusive obsessive thoughts, which lead to compulsive repetitive actions, which are severe enough to interfere with their life and functioning.
The opposite to this would simply be not having these constant thoughts.",OCD
538,I don't give a shit disorder.,OCD
539,"There are many types of OCD, thus there is no Polar Opposite to it…as it comes in many forms. However, you can argue that OCD being “stuck in a loop” - whatever that loop may be, the opposite could be seen as having no algorithm, no organization, no concern. Disorganized, in slumber, having no redeeming qualities, completely careless.
~Dan Gregory of Area-1255: The #1 Underground Psychiatry & NeuroScience Blog on The Internet: www.area1255.blogspot.com",OCD
540,"It can go into remission in up to 60% of cases, but relapse is still a possibility.[1] OCD is defined in the DSM-5 as obsessions, compulsions or both. An obsession is unwanted and intrusive thoughts. Usually, these thoughts are “sticky” and can’t be easily dismissed like most other people can. Everybody more or less experiences intrusive thoughts, but they don’t trouble the vast majority of other people. Someone with OCD will get stuck on an intrusive thought. This creates an obsession about the theme of the intrusive thoughts. Such themes can include doing harm to someone else or themselves, sexual, religious, contamination, or symmetry. I think it’s safe to say that most cases of OCD include a compulsion component. Handwashing, praying, neutralising, and so on.
Some cases the obsessions are in your consciousness all day. You may spend hours thinking about them.
It is unlikely you will ever get rid of the intrusive thoughts completely. But the disorder can be managed with medication and therapy. It can get the point where your OCD no longer bothers you, and you can live a mostly normal life or fully normal life.
So in that sense it can be cured, but it’s more like managed effectively. It will always be with you but it may no longer dictate or control your life.

541,"I have heard of people who have been successfully treated with CBT, Exposure therapy, medication etc who were told by psychiatrists at follow-up that they would no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for OCD if they were reassessed in that moment. In my opinion, that is a “remission” rather than a “cure”.
I say this because OCD is a neurodiversity. Our brains are wired differently. You can't perform a rewire, but you can employ strategies, such as those mentioned above, to manage your symptoms 💖",OCD
542,"We can be healed, which is not quite the same thing. I have been in remission from OCD for 15 years now. The first 1.5 years after I did exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy, I had no obsessions or compulsions. After that, I had 2–3 flares a year, typically lasting under one day. These days, I maybe have one flare-up a year. It’s a totally different life. I still have OCD and therefore am not cured, but I have treatment, tools, and medications now, and I am healed.",OCD

545,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD

547,Most experts agree that mental disorders like OCD are not curable. OCD can be effectively treated. The most common treatment for OCD is medication. The first line medications are SSRIs thought of as antidepressants. They need to be used at higher dosages in treating OCD. The best treatment for OCD is CBT including exposure and ritual prevention (ERP). This treatment works for a larger percentage of patients and leads to bigger changes that last after treatment is concluded.,OCD
548,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
549,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

550,"I would have to say no. As an OCD sufferer myself, the CBT that I had made my OCD worse. It made me question everything. It made me miserable. Every thought I had I tried to analyze, and it was overwhelming. I hated it. Telling a person who’s prone to obsessive thoughts to analyze, question, destruct, and argue with every single thought they have is pretty backwards logic, if you think about it. My therapist agrees now that this kind of therapy is not right for OCD, or at least not my OCD anyway. I guess everyone is different though, but if my experience of OCD is anything like others, I don’t see how a CBT approach would be appropriate. Seems like the exact opposite of what you should be doing. It made me more indecisive, which is a big part of my OCD - seeing every pro and con of something so much that no decision can ever be made. I’ve actually had more success with the silly ‘radical acceptance’ approach. Basically, you can’t fight it, so don’t. And don’t try to overthink it or analyze it or argue with it.

It has specific guidelines but there is much latitude in how they can be used. OCD is not a uniform disorder. This also complicates matters.

Steve DeBerry's answer to Why is cognitive behavioral therapy the most widely used evidence-based practice for improving mental health?",OCD
553,"I have said this before in another answer: the problem with a purely cognitive-behavioral approach to treatment (in this case, OCD) is that it relies too heavily on the rational function and its supposed power to explain away the distorted thinking and behavior.
Ultimately, OCD is not a cognitive-behavioral problem, rather it is symptomatic of an underlying issue. Treating only the distorted thinking and behavior would be equivalent to treating only the symptoms of a bacterial infection without considering the source of the infection.
You can disrupt the mechanism of OCD with CBT techniques, but without understanding the root of the problem, you can’t cure it.
Generally speaking, OCD is a maladaptive compensation for an inability to psychologically adapt to one’s environment. Environment in this case = life itself. Instead of truly living, a person with OCD leads a provisional life, filled with ceremonial punctilio.
OCD is an unconscious distortion of primitive ritual and ceremony. Primitive ceremonial procedure was performed in order to ward off evil or darkness of some kind – as if to say, “I must do this in order to keep that away.” And it was followed with the strictest attention to every detail – and under the threat of death to anyone who failed to follow that procedure.
It is important to note that early ritual and ceremony were natural expressions of psyche and not thought up. Rational thinking was a much later development in our evolution. This is why Jung called early ritual an instinctual process.
The typical expression of OCD is just like that early ritual: “I must do this in order to keep that away.” If you want to cure your OCD, then you have to let that come. It is not the monster you think it is. The monster is Life itself, something which will cease to be a monster when you face it consciously.
Whatever you are trying to keep away – the perceived threat - is a symbolic expression for something else. That something else is whatever you are avoiding or resisting at all costs. The tricky part is that avoidance and resistance can be either conscious or unconscious, or a little bit of both.
Avoidance or resistance to what? This is the riddle to be solved.
Another factor that makes OCD so difficult to modify is that it is rooted in the same mechanism as instinct - that’s what makes it compulsive, all or nothing behavior.
The one thing that has proved capable of modifying instinct is consciousness. So, in the case of OCD, you have to become conscious of your underlying issue.
In order to discover what the underlying issue is, you’ll have to go deeper than trying only to change your thoughts and behavior. You have to ask yourself,
“Why must I do this in this way? What terrible consequence do I try to ward off by this behavior?”
Let irrationality answer this question. Then you look at that answer symbolically.
Without knowing you or your situation, it would be difficult to give you an example of how this works. As far as what is at the source – that will be different for each person.
Personally, I take my lead from C.G. Jung. I let a person’s conscious situation and their dreams tell me what he or she might be avoiding or resisting. For example, sometimes, it’s a dreadful part of one’s own personality. Other times, it is a resistance to taking appropriate “adult” action in one’s life.
Remember that the energy trapped in maintaining OCD is energy that is unavailable for living the real life. If you can get a hold of that energy again, you’ll be unstoppable.",OCD
554,"Yes very effectively. But the therapy goes hand in hand with medications. One has to continue seeking mediactions as per the severity and as prescribed. Then with CBT you can handle it independently. It's important to know the correct information on OCD first (anxiety disorder) and then how it is tackle by CBT. You will learn first that how our thoughts, feelings and behavior are interconnected. Each feeds the other. Very important catch for clients to understand the disorder.
CBT will be specifically using techniques like hierarchy forming of obsessions and compulsions , mindfulness,breathing and relaxing exercises and Exposure methods. CBT will help you to understand the thinking errors (like Catastrophising) enabling you to catch and correct obsessive thoughts and with accompanied compulsions (behaviors to neutralize thoughts), one will learn to carefront the anxiety so that it will eventually drop and that will help you to not engage in compulsive acts when one feels anxious with thoughts. Thoughts comes and goes.
Behavioral techniques will be designed by a CBT practitioner mutually with clients and goals are set to help with the disorder.
Of course, after finding one's type of OCD. Seeking professional help would help. Always remember..
“Thoughts are not facts.”

Best wishes.",OCD
562,"OCD is by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and is most certainly debilitating. OCD isn't wanting to have tables lined up straight. It isn't wanting your pens in colour order. It isn't wanting to have a tidy room. OCD is a debilitating disorder that can take over your life, and is incredibly difficult to recover from.
OCD can manifest itself in so many ways, but it usually revolves around a set of phobias, or obsessions, that usually have a common factor. For me I feel the need to have control over every aspect of my environment in order to keep myself safe. I'm terrified of germs, bugs, and anything where I'm out of control or not myself, such as alcohol or carnival rides. Contact with any of these things used to make me feel overwhelmingly panicked.
It's not simply a matter of having a few phobias and avoiding them. They're called obsessions for a reason. You spend hours of your day thinking about how to avoid every thing that you obsess about. Then the compulsive side comes in. If you come into contact with any of these things that worry you, you then have to something to advert the danger you think you have put yourself in. It's not a choice, in your head it's a matter of life and death, removing this danger is necessary.
By giving into the compulsion you continue the cycle, where the only thing that help a certain obsession is to give into the compulsion. It's incredibly overwhelming, spending hours thinking about how to avoid a certain thing, going out of your way to avoid said thing, then when you inevitably come into contact with it having to do something awful to get rid of the panic.
For me my main obsession was germs. I had to about them at all costs. Otherwise I'd get sick and die. I'd only eat from dishes that had been washed in the dishwasher, because the sink water was filthy. I'd hold glasses up to the light to make sure they were clean. I'd get new cutlery if mine touched the table. I'd refuse to use my drink bottle ever again if anyone else drank from it. I refuse to swim in anything but the ocean. If anyone touched my toothbrush I'd start crying. I wouldn't hold on on the train, because people's dirty hands had touched the railing, instead I'd lean against the door in everyone's way. I had to make all my food fresh myself, so none of the ingredients were off. If I touched anything that worried me I'd scrub my hands with soap. Eventually my hands were cracked and raw from all the soap. I'd refuse physical contact with people, in case they were sick or hadn't washed their hands. This stuff was just the tip of the iceberg.
The social impact is also devastating, as no one wants to spend time with someone who has such intense anxiety around so much. You also drive your friends away, as you don't think they'd be any help. I know I ended up becoming depressed, feeling like so much was wrong with me and I had no one to go to. I'm a teenage girl, and so far I've never been in a relationship. I've been asked out by people I've liked, and I've wanted to ask people out, but if hugging a family member is worrying because of germs, the thought of kissing someone, let alone going any further is absolutely terrifying.
Then there's recovery. In order to recover from OCD you can have talk therapy or medication, often in combination. I was to scared to go on medication because I thought it might impact my thoughts to much and I'd stop being me. A method called cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT, is often used by psychologists. This basically involves exposing yourself to the exact thing that terrifies you in order to make it stop scaring you. Whatever your worst fear is think of it. Imagine having to expose yourself to it every single day, and feel that overwhelming fear that comes with that phobia in order to get better. Medication can help, but in the end without CBT you won't really get better. It's a horrible experience, trying so hard to go against everything your brain is telling you to do.
If you work incredibly hard eventually it does make a difference. You're less overwhelmed, and actually have the time to think about other things. As hard as CBT is, it certainly helps. But despite the fact it gets better you live in constant fear of relapse, of being miserable again, as without constant effort OCD can creep up on you again. And OCD isn't something you cure. It is something you learn to cope with, and work around in your life. You're not trying to get rid of OCD, sadly that's all but impossible, you're trying to get to a point where it doesn't interfere with your day to day happiness.
I hope from this you can see that despite the lack of obvious physical symptoms OCD is most certainly a debilitating disorder, that is able to seriously damage your way of life. And please, whatever you do, don't use OCD to describe your quirks, don't say you're so OCD about your pencils or your wardrobe. Hearing people describe your disorder as if it's a quirk to laugh about is devastating.",OCD
563,"First to answer your question in simple terms, yes it is one the very worst mental illnesses. There is an official psychiatric rank of the 300 legitimately defined mental illnesses in order of severity.
Schizophrenia is the worst mental illness followed by obsessive compulsive disorder at number 2. 3rd is bipolar disorder.
I suffer from extreme bipolar 1 and I’d say this. I’d trade for schizophrenia or OCD or borderline personality disorder, or autism or any randomly picked mental illness. Why? At least it would be a change of pace. I’m 48 and I don’t particularly appreciate what I’ve gone through to this point. I also don’t think that any other illness is any better or worse than another.
My point is that mental illness robs you of life so any one can’t be compared the other. They are all vile.",OCD
564,"OCD varies in severity. I have moderate OCD, and yeah, it sucks, but it's also my normal. I don't know what it's like not to have obsessive thoughts, or to have a mind at rest. Before diagnosis and therapy, I was pretty much crippled by it. I rarely left the house unless I had to, and I was late to work frequently because I couldn't stop myself from going back to check things and would miss my bus. But I still worked and supported myself, paid bills, etc. These days, having learned coping methods in therapy, I do okay. I will always have OCD, but I am able to manage it.
I have one neighbor with Bipolar I, and another who is a paranoid schizophrenic. Both of them are on full disability and Section 8 due to their mental health. My schizophrenic neighbor can often be heard screaming and cursing at the voices in her head, even from across the road. (When she's lucid she is very sweet and soft spoken.) My bipolar neighbor is frequently excessively manic and talks a mile a minute (she is very nice, but her mania ramps up my own anxiety, and I can only take her in doses when she is manic).
I'll take my OCD over either of those disorders. Again, I am used to having OCD. I don't know what it's like not to have it. OCD is a shitty disorder, and worse because those of us who have it know that our intrusive thoughts are not rational. But at least I am fully functional in the real world, and can work and support myself.",OCD
565,"“Pure O” can absolutely be debilitating just as traditional OCD can be. But part of the reason I think Pure O is so tricky is because the compulsions that fuel the OCD are mental rather than physical. It’s very sneaky.
For example, I’ll have an intrusive thought and then I either try to suppress the thought, reason with it, or sometimes try to find the answer/reassure myself by googling to rid myself of the anxiety that the thought causes. These mental compulsions are kind of hard to catch because they become so automatic. Therefore, when one does exposure therapy, it’s all mental instead of stopping a physical compulsion which can be quantified visually.
It can also be kind of exhausting because everything is happening inside your head. When I’m in a period of time where my OCD flares up, I feel like my brain is short circuiting with just how busy it is. Because not only am I dealing with intrusive thoughts, but my mental compulsions as well.
With all that being said, it’s not hopeless. My therapist was super helpful and knowledgeable in helping me tackle my Pure O and I now have the tools to be able to address my intrusive thoughts and mental compulsions. Medication is also helpful for me too.
In fact, 99% of the time when I am stable, I do not notice OCD whatsoever. There is a light on the other side of the tunnel!",OCD
566,"Both of these conditions are considered severe mental illnesses.
It is difficult to treat either of them for different reasons. People with schizophrenia may well have delusions and hallucinations without the correct treatment, while people with bipolar will more than likely have mania and depression without treatment.
The treatment is different in some respects, but similar in others. Bipolar is a mood disorder so requires mood stabilizers, whereas people with schizophrenia will likely require anti-psychotics for their hallucinations and delusions.
The crossover is when people with bipolar 1 have either delusions, hallucinations or intractable depression. They may well need anti-psychotics as well.
But these two are very difficult diseases to treat. It is a fine art in the hands of a professional. They may need to try various medications until stability is maintained.",OCD
567,"Thanks Imagine you wake up and all you can think about is the strong urge you feel to blow your brains out, daily (MDD.)
Imagine you refuse to eat because you know somebody poisoned your food and you can’t watch TV because every time the screen is on somebody is watching you through that screen (schizophrenia.)
Imagine you wake up and you can’t go 10–15m without 2–4 gulps of booze. If you don’t drink you shake like your freezing and start seizing violently.
Imagine you are a whore in church and you are approaching the confessional box and for some reason you can’t stop sweating.
The point? The most severe case of any disorder is the worst to have. There is not one that is worse than the other; they all suck.
So take your pick.
Gun, please. Thank you.",OCD
568,"Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are considered the most debilitating and serious mental illnesses a person can develop. OCD can be very limiting and painful, but the outcomes and prognosis for OCD are better than those for schizophrenia. People with OCD can usually, but not always, have jobs and successful relationships. The majority of people with schizophrenia, 4 out of 5, are too disabled to hold a steady job. One thing that is particularly painful about OCD is that it is ego-dystonic, meaning the person suffering recognizes how “crazy” they feel (and sometimes act). That can be terrifying. By contrast, people with schizophrenia are often terrified, but they are not usually worried about being “crazy.” I have met schizophrenics with “insight” who know they are ill, but most people who are psychotic cannot tell that they are suffering from mental illness. They feel as though they are living in a waking nightmare.",OCD
569,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

570,"OCD, can be effectively treated by counselling, meditation and various spiritual practices and teachings. Other medicines whether it's Ayurvedic or Allopathic are just supportive and not the whole and sole treatment.
In any psychological disorder, medicated ghee like Mahakalyanak ghrita, Mahapaishachik Ghrita, Jatamansi, Bramhi etc can be helpful.
Root of many psychological diseases is FEAR, one should understand that fear doesn't have any existential reality. It's just in your mind. Also, Human mind is the source of creation, that is why in Hinduism it's said that 'अहम् ब्रम्हास्मी। '. It means we are ( potential) Brahma / Creator. We continuously create our life situations intentionally or unintentionally. Fearful mind creates more fearful situations! In order to create desirable situations our mind should be organised. This is achieved through meditation and various spiritual practices.

572,"Ancient Indian sages (read scientists) have told us that “pran and prakruti” never change. Why ? Because it is “sahaj”, a sanskrut word meaning “sah: = with and “j” born. A person is born with a certain mental trait which differs from person to person. This is known as prakruti of a person. Pran and prakruti are born and die together.
There is also an ancient belief - “tunde tunde mati: bhinn:”.
Tund = head (actually brain);
mati = intelligence (understanding, comprehension etc.).
Bhinn: = different.
Mati differs from head to head (brain).
Modern scientists have discovered that the DNA of every person differs from person to person. Even a father’s DNA never matches 100% with his children who also have some difference in their DNA profiles. Is not this a proof of validity of ancient Indian thinking ? For me, IT IS.
Indian sages also said that there are only 3 types of diseases : 1. of the body, 2. of the mind and 3. of or from accidents (fall, bumping and in the modern age, vehicular.)
For mental diseases/disorders ayurved prescribes the treatment of medicine and dev-vyapay-ashray; “divine” therapy like darshan, havan/home, pooja, Ishwar smaran, yog (chitt-vruti-nirodh). This will soothe the agitated neurons of a person with an obsessive compulsive disorder ( I call it a mental trait).
A person with this trait should get himself involved in an activity of his heart’s choice, such as a hobby or liking. When the mind is focused on his heart’s choice, the part of the brain which is obsessed with compulsion will become ‘inactive’.
There are also ayurvedic herbals for reducing nerve agitation but they cannot change the individual prakruti They can help reduce modern age problems like tension, hurry-hurry-hurry (I do not know whereto), stress, mental fatigue, worries etc. but they cannot change the prakruti of a person.

573,"Hello! My name is Rahul. And I have successfully recovered from severe OCD of 7 years. Let me tell you how.
It all started when I was 15. I started having superstition that my certain actions cause certain results. Slowly it began to graduate and I started associating my fears with my actions i.e. if I don't do this, that will happen. It didn't took me long to develop rituals like checking every door, tap and window before going to bed, writing and cutting off words if it didn't get written in particular pattern, bowing at every temple, mosque or gurudwara in my way, taking God's name if even a slight bad thought crossed my mind and so on… You can guess soon it became extremely frustrating and impossible for me to live. I was living in my head and not in the real world.
Everyone started noticing my weird habits. I realised I needed help. At the age 17 I went to my first psychiatrist. But that doctor was bit selfish and keen on selling meds and gave me lots of high doses medicines. Result was it made me super drowsy and I was just sleeping my days off most of the time. And whenever I missed any dose, it drove me crazy, my skin started pinching and I couldn't sleep.
So I changed the doctor after 6–7 months. This doctor gave me mild doses which reduced my rituals by 20–30% but I was still suffering. So I stopped my meds and made up my mind that whatever my mind tells me to do, I won't do it. Result - Didn't help much.
Now I was 20 and still suffering. So I went to a very senior/experienced psychiatrist. He was bit strict but gave me just one tablet - Chlomipramine 25 mg and later increased the dose to 50mg and 75mg per day. It helped me a lot and my OCD got reduced by 70–80%. But here I need to mention that some very major changes occurred in my life during that time. I met a girl, fell in love, started taking care of myself and started enjoying my days more or less. The arrival of someone in my life along with some other positive changes (which I mentioned below) naturally brought a level of newness, excitement and zeal with it which also helped me a lot. So I continued that med for 6 more years.
Now I was 26, in a new city, having my dream job of being a script writer albeit having a degree in computer science, happily in a relationship with that beautiful girl. Life was going good but I still had minor fears and rituals, you can say 20% of the OCD. So I decided to visit a new psychiatrist. I opened practo.com, reviewed every psychiatrist based on experience and public’s feedback and booked an appointment.
And this Doctor was like an angel sent from heaven (I can share his details if you like). He listened to me, my medical history and gave me few meds, injection (for some chemical which was less in my body). A course of 6 months and I am completely cured now. I never thought I will be free from OCD one day, I kind of accepted that this is my life now and things will never get better. But here I am- Happy, Healthy and Full of Life.
So What Helped:-
The Unconditional love and support of my parents, brother, sister and girlfriend. They always stayed by my side, understood my pain (no matter how superficial it seemed to them or hurt them) and never let me stay in a bad place for too long.
Getting my ass off that bed and seeing a doctor. The best decision I made in my life was to get help.
Significant changes in my lifestyle. Falling in love, developing a hobby (for me it was participating in quiz contests, during my college life I participated in every tech fest of every college in my district).
Also SITCOMS. Believe it or not, shows like FRIENDS, How I met your Mother, The Office, Parks and Rec, Modern Family helped me lot to laugh, feel light and connect to something to crawl out of that crippling depression.
And Most Importantly FAITH. When you replace FEAR with FAITH in GOD, Fear loses its power. If your mind tells you do this 15 times otherwise that will happen, tell your mind that it is just a figment of your imagination created due to imbalance of serotonin and dopamine in your brain and nothing will happen if you don't do what it tells you to do. Once you realise that you defied your brain’s silly command and everything is still as it was, you will have power over your disease. And FAITH in GOD gives you that Power to stay strong and face your fear. But remember, FAITH and FEAR is completely opposite. Faith does not mean you start fearing God, it means you start trusting God.
What didn't Helped:-
Choosing the wrong psychiatrist. Trust me a bad doctor can worsen your life. Always go for an experienced doctor. Research about them, take feedback from people. Now there are lots of websites with patients feedbacks. You can check them out and select a doctor whose reviews match your condition.
Staying all day in the bed, aloof, accepting the fact that nothing will get better and I will be like this always.
Being careless and ignorant about my disease. OCD like any physical disease like flu or cold is just an imbalance of chemicals in body and completely treatable. With Right Attitude, Right Doctor and Right Medication you will get better and eventually completely cured.
I hope my answer gives you Hope, Strength and Insight that OCD is Curable and you will get better. God Bless ^_^",OCD
574,"Its not about coaching or Video lectures. It more about my mentor who helped me to crack this exam very easily.
I have passed my FRM Part 1 in May 2022. I am working professional i have family to manage and a full time job and also I need to study to upgrade myself. For that I need a mentor who can make the path easy for me to travel, rest I need to walk of my own.
Click here on this blue link to contact Deepak Sir Directly WhatApp.
Now lets come to coaching, earlier I started to study of my own using some books available in the market but then I felt I lack many concepts and I am not doing justice to course. Also i was blindly moving without knowing the direction. I was sure that I can crack the exam with self study but I will lack concepts so I decided to join coaching institute for this basically a coach and a mentor who can guide me from time to time.
Trust me I searched many institutes in India and then I finally choose Deepak Sir as my mentor and I joined RBei Classes. I will tell you the reason and i will give my genuine review on this.
They provide access in laptop, mobile or tab ( Android/Windows/IOS)
1) They provided video lectures which are easy to understand and its the best way to study for any working professional.
2) Less efforts more output so course is designed properly within 300 hours of studies.
3) I need personal communication with the teacher directly as and when needed i can communicate with my teacher over phone call. His WhatsApp contact number is in this link you can contact him for any doubts regarding FRM Coaching, he is very kind and humble person. WhatsApp him you will find his contact on his website. https://www.rbeiset.com/frm
4) His practical sessions are good, he uses excel to explain concepts. He explains concepts so easily it looks like cake walk after watching his lecture.
5) His weekly test and Mock exam really helped me to crack this exam very easily. They actually polished me to perform best in exam. No Coaching institute have this facility of weekly test. Improve as you move ahead his agenda. So test yourself before you move ahead.
6) His Short Notes and Mind Maps are excellent for last minute revision
7) He will personally solve all your doubts 365 days availability. You can call him or you can WhatsApp him anytime to discuss your doubts.
8) He is a combination of a traditional teacher and a Modern teaching style using advanced features on his website like Unlimited views and validity till you pass. You can access all your wrong questions at one place to revise them later on. “Learn from your mistakes if you want to improve “.
9) Being young and enthusiastic he is ready to deliver best for his students.
10) Now he is providing Advance Excel sessions, practical knowledge and technical knowledge with most used language ( Python and R )
These are the above reasons that students from more than 20 countries are joining his classes specially middle east countries and India. He teaches only 200 students in one session so that he can deliver his best. And that's the reason his pass percentage is very high.
There is no alternative of best and he is best!!

576,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
577,"There are a lot of ways to make a profit online; some require a lot of investments, some don't.
There isn't really a way to tell which one is the absolute best, although one of the best ways to make money online is becoming an affiliate for a company.
Even for several companies.
Did you know that a shocking amount of 81% of world brands use affiliate marketing?
An affiliate business can be a very profitable one. The commission rate for a sale varies from 5% to 60%, depending on the company. There are cases when affiliates are getting an even bigger commission than that.
If you are interested, below I will give some tips on how to become a successful affiliate, and how it's possible to start making a living from it.
How do you become an affiliate?
First, you need to decide on what you are interested in. Are you passionate about traveling? Or perhaps computers are what interests you the most?
It is recommended to choose a niche, that fascinates you, that way you will always have something to talk about!
After choosing a niche, it's essential to start building your credibility. By that, I mean, to build trust in yourself.
Think about it. If a person who has never taken a flight would start telling you, which exotic trips are the best, would you trust them?
It would be more persuasive if that person would write about its own experience in the past. How he or she went on exotic trips and only then would he or she give tips on which tours are the best.
This is what all the bloggers do - they share their experience about something they know in their blog. After some time, most of them become affiliates and start making a profit.
In fact, 84% of the publishers are already doing affiliate partnerships.
What will you need?
If you want to create a blog, you first need a website. Don't get anxious. Building a website is not that hard, nor is it expensive!
You will only need a domain and a hosting plan, to pay for, while content management systems that allow building a website or a blog are usually free. If you wish to know how it's done, you can check this out.
After you have a website, and you've started filling it up, you can begin to join the affiliate programs. Since you have a topic, that you write about on your site, you should choose the brands that are relevant to that topic.
Don't forget to check the requirements set by companies, and whether you fit them.
Usually, joining affiliate programs can be very easy - only a short form needs to be filled out.
I would like to add that it is not always a must to have a website to become an affiliate. Although most of the companies require you to have a strong online presence.
Not to forget, it would be harder to become credible and implement your referral links, without any website.
After you register, you will get an affiliate link (can also be a code, a coupon code, or some other reference). It will track all the traffic and sales you send the companies' way.
Be careful not to mix the link with the general company's link. Including a general link will end up in you not getting your commission.
There are three main ways of how you can get the commission from a company:
CPS (Cost Per Sale) – getting a certain amount of money, per every sale made through your referral;
CPC (Cost Per Click) – this is a similar case as ads. You would get revenue after a certain amount of traffic you sent through your referral;
CPL (Cost Per Lead) – means that you have an individual agreement with the company. You can get payments after customers subscribed, filled a form, or performed any other action you agreed upon.
There are specific ways, that can help you to promote your referral both in your website and social media:
Include your affiliate links to the content you write. Don't push your customer too much towards buying it, but also don't undersell;
Write separate blogs posts, that solely cover the product and its properties;
Add advertisements of the product to your site;
Don't forget to include social media - it can be a very efficient and useful tool for promotions.
Create video content about your affiliate brand. You can even do formats like reviews or unboxing videos;
Don't be afraid to be an affiliate for a few brands. As long as you are keeping a common sense; it is okay to promote a few different products;
Check how to increase your traffic and optimize your conversions. Raising both of those will naturally lead to more conversions.
It is essential to be transparent. Customers are becoming more aware of marketing ""tricks"".
Affiliate partnership shouldn't ever be hidden, nor the fact that one is getting money for the sales. Not only that, but some countries have strict regulations towards disclosing your partnership.
So here it is. One of the new and very efficient ways of making money online. It is pretty simple to implement, yet it has unlimited potential.
The biggest affiliates are making a living solely from this, so don't ever feel discouraged. Good luck!",OCD

580,"Jesus. I once suffered from HOCD even though I am straight. I even tried to watch straight porn (something I don't do because of my Christian beliefs) to “cure” myself. What I discovered was that while my physical body reacts to straight porn like sexual arousal, but my mind constantly has these intrusive homosexual thoughts that almost drove me crazy. But thanks to that I know I am fully straight and these thoughts are not of my own.
I knew porn isn't the way to go. There had to be some other ways.
I struggled with this for so many years. It often drains me and tires me out. But praise God, it gets better and better. I am finding a lot more victory against it than ever. Now I am completely free from those intrusive homosexual thoughts, though I am still struggling with OCD to a small extent. Jesus is working to set me free :)",OCD
581,"This was the hardest thing I had to deal with in my life. I suffered from the homosexual obsessive compulsive disorder (HOCD). I say suffered as in past tense, but the truth is it’s still with me, however now I am in control and can dismiss intrusive thoughts easily. As someone said before me, you should look into ERP therapy. For me it was a miracle I desperately needed. Considering I had suicidal thoughts as well you can imagine how bad my anxiety and OCD were. It’s the only thing that worked for me. The best thing is you can do it on your own in case you can’t afford therapist but I would strongly suggest finding one you can trust. It will make your recovery easier and faster. I saw the first results in 5 months of doing it, but it can vary depending on many factors, so don’t get discouraged if it won’t work right away.
Another thing that helped me was to understand that I am not what my thoughts are saying I am. You are not your thoughts!
I wish you best of luck. And remember you are not alone and you can and will gain control of your life back.
YOU CAN DO IT. YOU ARE IN CONTROL.",OCD
582,"Sexual OCD is the name given to identify the category of OCD where disturbing thoughts and/or associated compulsions to nullify those thoughts are carried out by the affected person. The thoughts are so disturbing because they come across as contradicting the person’s values and the nature of relationship he has with the person for whom the sexual thoughts surface within him. He detests having those thoughts and the more the pushes them away, the stronger they get.
Nevertheless, the point is note is they are thoughts with no basis, a manifestation of a system (brain) which is overworking. Breaking up these thoughts according to the level of anxiety they give, picking up each one starting from the lowest anxiety giving which relatively is easier to tolerate, learning to stay with those thoughts without responding in unhealthy ways and working up the hierarchy to more disturbing thoughts, will help to cope up with the thoughts. A very important element of recovery process to is know these are only thoughts and not to give them importance during the times of trigger and letting them pass. And this comes with practice. Once these are learnt, managing the thoughts whenever they surface becomes possible and gets better and better. Acceptance and commitment therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy and Exposure Response Prevention therapy help developing rational insights and healthy response which will bring relief the impacted person.
The thoughts could be disturbing and getting the help of a professional to help in managing them will help.",OCD
583,"It is hard. I can only speak through experience.
A life changing thing (before I started meds) I learnt when trying to cope with OCD is that your groinal movement does not reflect your mind. Once you learn that, you can realise that you don’t need to mentally search your groin every time you are faced with a triggering situation or image. You don’t need to ignore it, you just need to notice it and learn to be at peace with it. It isn’t real arousal. It is a result of focussing your mind on your groin. Ask yourself, “what came first? Your mind thinking about groinal movement or the groinal movement itself?” Most of the time, it is a result of your mind thinking about it. Other times, it has become a learnt behaviour from previous triggering situations. It isn’t evidence of ANYTHING. It doesn't feel like your usual arousal because it isn’t real arousal - it is anxiety arousal, OCD arousal. You know you’re not going to act upon it.
Another thing that helps, is medication. I have been taking Zoloft for the past year and my symptoms of all my OCD have nearly stopped. Less than daily, usually my pure OCD manifests less than once a week. And when it does manifest, I don’t get panic attacks over it anymore.
Hope this helps a little. I wish I could have read this back when I didn’t know what was “wrong with me”

584,"I’m a therapist specialised in OCD/anxiety therapy. I suffered some similar issues through life and that made me want to help kindred spirits.
First of all sexual OCD is common. At this moment I am treating 3 people with those kind of specific issues.
So how do you cope with that?
There is no universal solution. Sorry. Find yourself a competent therapist with experience in this field and let him or her guide you into finding concrete choices you can make to ease your problem.
The big differentiating factor is what your thoughts are trying to prevent. Are you trying to prevent public humiliation? Jailtime (sex ocd about children)? Job loss? Rejection from family and friends? It comes down to function analysis to give real concrete answers to this question specific to you.
One of these answers was about straight porn as exposure for homoerotic ocd. That is a possible choice I would recommend to a patient who feels sex with somsone of the same sex is wrong and would destroy their identity.
I would not recommend it to someone afraid of being rejected by their family if he or she acted gay.
Either way a complicated problem like this requires a specialist to adapt and offer choices to you. Go see a therapist.",OCD
585,"Breathe. I'm writing this as a person who have gone through OCD for the past 10 years. In my early 20s.
I hope the following helps, I use these to deal with pure O (centres more around thought rituals in the head rather than actual processes that are physically performed).
First, you need to accept that OCD will never disappear completely. Part of our brains were born this way - our mechanisms to stop intrusive thoughts are weaker than other people. But it's okay. With medication taken over a long period of time, the brain structure will change slowly to make it all better.
Second, accept the intrusive thoughts. I know it sounds impossible. But you know it's not rational, so just ignore it.
*Dont force it out of your brain, my psyciatrist used to talk about the “polar bear” effect.
(for example, I tell you not to think about the polar bear.
*wait for 5seconds*
Now, what are you thinking about? Highly likely you are thinking about polar bears and their furry fluffiness.)
Simply let it flow through you.. Remember how some teachers would nag monotonously at you and, usually you just let his/her words go in from one ear and go out from the other? Treat OCD as that annoying naggy old teacher. Naggy people are gonna nag motor matter what right? Just ignore them and don't bother arguing with it. Disassociate yourself from OCD thoughts. That is not you. Then watch as the intrusive thoughts surface and die down again.
Third, here's an emergency tip.
when things get out of control in your head and anxiety kills you on the inside, press the “ pause” button in your head. Stop everything you are doing, look outside the window and fix your gaze at a specific spot. Continue staring, watching the world go by and a bystander, relax. Then after the anxiety goes down, get back to fight your demons again.
Lastly, please have faith that things will get better. Though you are in pain now and may feel as if all is lost, recognize that you can only go up from the lowest point of your life. I was ten when I discovered I had OCD. I could hardly sleep for 2 years because I would be paralyzed with anxiety at night. I remember I just wanted to rip all the defective parts of my brain out to stop them from leading me around in the never ending OCD ritual. But I survived. With the right medication, which provided a stable enough base for me to start fighting OCD, I survived and flourished. Today, I'm a college kid in her last year of studies.
You can do it too. Have faith in tomorrow",OCD
586,"Sigh
After going through the previous answers to this question, I have to answer.
Many people out there are answering despite not understanding what OCD is. You have diagnosed OCD.
I am proud of you for figuring out what it is so young.
I am proud of you for noticing it surrounds sexually harming children.
I am proud of you for knowing that the thoughts disgust you.
I know you do not want to act upon these repetitive thoughts because you have OCD. It is scary. But you know you won’t. No children around you are in danger. You are allowed to have children when you’re older because you are not a danger to them. You will not lose control of your body. You will not act on these thoughts.
Now, get treatment.
You don’t need to go into the details or even tell your therapist or parents that your OCD involves sexually harming children. All you need to do is tell your therapist that you have OCD and ask if they can refer you to an OCD specialist. Tell your parents you have OCD. No details. Then tell your parents you are getting a new OCD therapist. You don’t have to explain to them what your intrusive thoughts are. Once you have an OCD specialist, figure out if you like them in the first session and if you can trust them. Once you trust them, then you can go ahead and tell them your OCD obsessions. They will not report you to police because you are not a danger. They will not lock you up because you express no desire to act upon your OCD and you get no pleasure from the thoughts.
I assumed, from what you have said that this all feels very familiar. It is scary having OCD at 15. I know. People online will always misunderstand OCD, and think you’re admitting you’re a pedo or a sex addict, so please speak to people with OCD, or with a degree in OCD psychology - people who understand.
Hope you’re ok",OCD

589,"The question should be “How worst is OCD”
It was within me since my childhood as i used to ask the same question multiple times until my mind accept it, it will be even 4 or 10 times.
But it continued for almost 22 years since my childhood to July'12.
Suddenly, In August’12, I was bringing a glass of water for someone, then after filling the glass, a thought strucked my mind that there is something wrong like dust particles is in the glass and compel me to throw the water and again fill it with fresh one. It started with 1–2 times but over the time became a compulsory act for me to throw and fill for even 10 times wasting 10–15 mins to drink water.
The second instance, was when i was driving my bike, suddenly my mind asked me to check “Whether you have run your bike over someone” . Then i return back at my arrival point and used to inspect roads to confirm the same multiple times.Due to this I used to take extra time to reach my destination. For example - If A distance of 5km take 15 mins then I was taking 1 hours.
Activities was increasing day by day and this was in every act, i was doing that , apart from i have mentioned here.
I used to wash hand multiple times after coming out of washroom as i feel that my hand still not cleaned and even it was harming my skin badly.
I used to waste half an hour in the washroom repeating the act multiple times.
When i watch movies then a single movie of 2 hours taking 4 hours to complete because there was compulsion by mind to replay some scenes multiple times.
In winter, I was bathing many times even at mid night as there was a feeling that my dody is not cleaned after watching bad objects, garbage,dead body etc.
Was Unable to sleep and used to wake up the whole night thinking what happened to me while crying.
I was not able to study and also my memory power was becoming weak.
In tension, my heart beat used to increased much faster and my body trembles.
I was fond of counting each and every things multiple times and placing them in order untill my mind accept that its ok.
I as sufferring from OCD since 2012 August and started my trearment in 2015 after rigorius struggle of 3 years and taking medicine from that time. I was on sleeping pills for two years. I am still undergoing my treatment and feel nuch better now. But one thing i regret is i am almost 5 years behind in my studies as my friends are employed now but not me. Our neighbour asks my parent, what is he doing in all these years, but you can answer to some but not to all.
My family member laughs at me and treat the symptoms of OCD as joke because there is very little awareness about mental illness in India as we know mental means mad.
It is not something that i can show , look i have fever, but only feel it within ourself.
Still, My family except my father belives that i had nothing because with them i was good.
That was just horrible experience and i used to weep. when i think about it in hindsight.
I give credit to “ CRIME PATROL OF SONY” as this serial gives an important message at the end that if anything you think is not going right then don't ignore it, consult a physciatrist.
I now know the reason why people suffering from depression suicides because their family dont accept that such thing even exists.
No one was with me , I myself consulted a physciatrist as i was living away from my parents .
The worst thing is that even well educated person are not ready to accept that such disease even exists and its upto you to control it
Even i tried a lot to not do the said activity but it was impossible for me as my mind had taken my control.
Please spread awareness about mental illness and don't ignore it.
I want to specifically mention that those who are suffering from anykind of mental illness can approach me,I have fought the dreaded battle which 99% succemmbed to. I will guide you in all possible way & want to be a part of your journey of recovery. I don't want to let anyone suffer what I had gone through,it was brutal, heartwreching deadliest,harmful more than one can ever imagine. I want to be a part of society to facilitate and educate everyone out there about mental illness.I have unimaginable will power,self motivation,never die attitude no matter what and the capability to never bow down to anything across the globe ( it helped me immensely )

590,"Exposure therapy is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that is commonly used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared stimuli, such as situations, objects, or thoughts, that trigger their obsessions and compulsions.
Here's how exposure therapy works in treating OCD:
Identifying Triggers: The therapist works with the patient to identify the specific situations, objects, or thoughts that trigger their obsessions and compulsions.
Exposure: The patient is gradually exposed to the triggers in a controlled and safe environment. This can involve imagining the trigger, looking at pictures, or being in the presence of the trigger itself.
Response Prevention: During the exposure, the patient is instructed to avoid performing their compulsions, such as washing their hands, checking locks, or repeating phrases.
Repeated Exposure: The exposure and response prevention exercises are repeated over multiple sessions, gradually increasing the duration and intensity of the exposure.
Habituation: With repeated exposure, the patient's anxiety and distress in response to the trigger decrease, and they become desensitized to the trigger, leading to a reduction in their OCD symptoms.
Exposure therapy works by changing the patient's relationship with their triggers, reducing their anxiety and fear associated with them. The therapy helps patients confront their fears and compulsions, learn new coping skills, and develop a sense of control over their thoughts and behaviors. The goal of exposure therapy is to enable patients to face their triggers and manage their symptoms independently in the long term.",OCD
591,"I agree very much with Carole’s answer above regarding the power of exposure therapy. However, I’ve been reading Jeffrey M. Schwartz’s phenomenal self-help book for OCD sufferers called Brain Lock, and I think that the exact neuroscience behind OCD-and the neuroplasticity to reverse engineer a solution to the disorder-is just as interesting.
There’s a lot of evidence from studies at UCLA that OCD is caused by a part of the brain becoming over-heated or ‘hyper-metabolic’ (thus experiencing inflammation which leads to mental burnout) and another part which is basically ‘locked in’ to relaying the same useless information. The useless information is what the specialists refer to as intrusive thoughts, and the over-heated part of the brain causes the person to engage in compulsive behaviour to ‘get rid’ of the worrying thought or feared object, as Carole puts it.
Specifically, the orbital cortex is hyper-metabolic. That tells you what your next step should be; to quote Schwartz:
“The brain’s “error-detection circuit,” it is located directly over the sockets. Here, thought and emotion combine. The orbital cortex can inform you that something is right or wrong, whether it is something to approach or avoid.”
The striatum-in particular the section of it which acts as a sensory filter for the brain to prior behaviours-called the caudate nucleus, is also counter-productively hyper-active and mal-functioning. The book compares the striatum to a ‘gateway’ for the sensory information which basically gets stuck open for reasons then unknown, speculated by Schwartz to be staple survival behaviours in our evolutionary programming; hence the title ‘Brain Lock.’ The disastrous result of the sensory flood-gates being jammed open is to be haunted by intrusive thoughts which OCD patients are all too familiar with. OCD is tenacious because the intrusive thoughts suggest to you that performing the compulsive behaviour will reduce the frequency and severity of the thoughts coming-but that very likely makes the striatum even more ‘stuck open.’ Worse, there’s a primitive part of the brain tied to the fight-or-flight reflex-the cingulate gyrus-which also gets tricked into believing the false information being sent. This would strengthen the ‘out-dated evolutionary data’ hypothesis Schwartz proposes, since we would not have survived without prioritising sensitivity to threat levels. Finally, those afflicted with OCD face executive dysfunction, since in event of a malfunctioning striatum leading to intrusive thoughts flooding through and an inability for the person to switch mental gears, the frontal cortex cannot focus on advanced sequences of behaviours or complex ideas while it’s busy trying to handle what used to be basics.
The great thing about neuroplasticity is that it proves that people who are currently ruled by their unstable mental health condition, have not lost all hope of regaining control over their life. Instead, the brain can be literally re-wired. Specifically, exposure therapy can for all intents and purposes creates new neural pathways in the cortex, and new, more constructive and helpful sensory information to pass through the caudate nucleus, thus helping the striatum to finally shut the metaphorical gateway! It’s for this reason that exposure therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy prove to be far more effective than either mere medication (which only suppresses the symptoms, it does not address the root causes of the dysfunctional behaviour) or older modes of therapy such as a psychoanalytic or psychodynamic approach (which seeks a rational and personalised, culturally conditioned explanation to what is most likely a primarily biological malfunction.)
The Four Steps - Brain Lock
[Quoting from ‘Chapter 2: Reattribute’]",OCD
592,"Exposure therapy, specifically ""Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP),"" works to treat OCD by gradually exposing individuals to the situations or thoughts that trigger their obsessions, allowing them to face their anxiety without performing their usual compulsive behaviors, which over time helps to reduce the power of those obsessions and lessen the urge to perform compulsions; essentially, by confronting their fears in a controlled environment, they learn that the feared outcome does not occur, leading to decreased anxiety and better management of OCD symptoms.",OCD
593,"This is what helped me cure my 8-year-long OCD. I know it’s different for everyone, but these changes made a huge difference in my life:
Changing my diet: I started avoiding sugar and processed foods. I didn’t realize how much my eating habits were affecting my mental health. Once I cut out the junk, I noticed my anxiety and obsessive thoughts started to ease up. I switched to whole foods like veggies, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
Meditation: This was hard at first because my mind would race all the time. But with practice, even just 10 minutes a day, it became a way to slow down those obsessive thoughts. It helped me focus on the present instead of spiraling.
Supplements and vitamins: I started taking magnesium and omega-3s, which I heard could help with anxiety and brain health. I don't know if it’s a coincidence, but I did notice a difference after adding them to my routine.
Exercise: This was a big one. I made it a point to move my body every day, whether it was going for a walk or doing a quick workout at home. It really helped me channel some of that restless energy and made me feel more in control.
Journaling: Writing things down, especially when I felt overwhelmed, helped me organize my thoughts and release what was bothering me. It became a way to process things without obsessing over them.
Lastly, I tried therapy through ‘MantraCare’. They offered a trial session, and my therapist was very helpful in teaching me coping strategies that I could use every day. If you're looking for affordable therapy, I highly recommend giving them a shot.
Hope this helps!",OCD
594,"This is my personal input. Please do not take it as a professional opinion or anything even close to that.
I have been coping with OCD since I was about 10, maybe earlier than that. I didn't know it was OCD, I thought I was just different, special, in a weird way. I only found out it was a thing much later, in my mid 20s.
So, going back to your question: I have tried this, with a relative degree of success. I force myself to not do the rituals. Usually the first hours are very stressful, the first couple days are really dificult, but eventually I start to feel like a weight is being removed from my shoulders. It's a fantastic feeling, like you're being released from a very unpleasant situation.
The problem is (for me), that life throws all sorts of bad and unexpected things in our way, and when that happens, the first thing my brain tells me is ""see, this is your fault, you should have touched that door handle twice, you should have put your right shoe a couple inches ahead of the left when you take them off at the end of the day. Time to get back to following the orders, before something bad happens again!""
And I'm back to square one.",OCD
595,"Exposure therapy is useful because it introduces the feared object in stages so that the individual can learn to tolerate successive elevations of anxiety while then allowing it to go down. The person with the fear can see that ultimately, the symptoms of fear will relinguish.
After multiple exposures to the feared object, the anxiety does not increase to the original level. Soon the person can approach what they are afraid of and realize that they can manage and minimize the physical response.
OCD is a response to worry and fear. By obsessively focusing on certain feared stimuli and trying to minimize it through ineffective means is conducive to exposure therapy. I would encourage people with OCD to identify a therapist with expertise in this intervention. Not every therapist is trained to work with disorder using exposure therapy.
Exposure therapy is highly effective for phobias and fear of specific stimuli. More complex anxiety oriented disorders such as PTSD has showed mixed results.",OCD
596,"Yes they can. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
I suffered from OCD and pure obsessive thoughts. I remember, at one time, counting up how many different compulsions and Obsessions I had. 27! I honestly thought I was destined for the psychiatric centre for life.
Now that I'm FULLY CURED I'm back to working as a chef and have decided to change my career. I've enrolled into an electronics technology course and start next fall.
As for reducing your IQ... For a couple of years, while I was recovering, I noticed my focus and memory were terrible. It's taken awhile to bounce back from that but believe that my cognitive functions are back to where they were prior to my 6 year illness.",OCD
597,"The short answer is, yes. ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) therapy is good for all types of phobias and all manifestations of OCD.
There are a few simple premises to this therapy.
Face your fear: If you want to learn swimming, cycling, driving, riding, flying, etc, you have to face some fears. With swimming, it is of drowning, with the others it is a fear of accident and in some cases, death. Yet, if you want to, you will bulldoze past your fears and apprehensions and master the art. You will face the fear enough number of times, so that you become an expert at the skill, till it becomes second nature to you.
Not giving up: You will fail many times during the course of this therapy, as it causes a lot of anxiety, since you are coming face-to-face with your fear, that too willingly. But the key is to not give up. Just as a child who wants to learn to walk does not give up, no matter how many times he falls, so too the person going through ERP has to persist and keep trying till he masters the art.
Start small: One doesn’t face the largest fears right away in this. So when someone thinks about it, the prospect of having to face their biggest fears right away seem very daunting. But, the method follows a systematic identification of all fears, grading them as per severity, and then facing them one at a time, starting with the easiest and working one’s way upwards. So if a fear cannot be broken down into smaller manageable chunks, and even the thought of facing the fear causes anxiety, then the exposure is just that. Thinking about it. Then when the anxiety reduces, maybe pictures on mobile. Maybe cliparts before the actual object. Then the real picture on the mobile, then pictures on the computer, then the real thing from a distance, and then finally the real thing from up close. So if this approach is followed, it is a gradual facing of fear, which will work. Like if you are told you would have to appear for an engineering exam when you are in 4th grade, you would get anxious. But that’s because you aren’t ready to face it yet. So you face the 4th grade exams first.
Being receptive: Unless you have faith in the therapist and the therapy, you will tend to slack at it and may either not reveal everything that is relevant to the therapy, or may not follow what the therapist tells you. In either case, there is a likelihood of failure.
Taking responsibility: This therapy is like learning a sport. You cannot learn a sport by popping a pill. You cannot learn a sport by watching from the sidelines while the coach is doing all the work. You have to get your hands dirty. Unless you decide that you are responsible for your betterment and work diligently, the therapist cannot do much.
There are a few more but these are the important ones. Keeping these premises in mind, you can make sure that ERP helps you in eliminating all phobias and manifestations of OCD.
PS: I am using you as a general pronoun and not specifically addressing you, Supreemo.
Hope this helps.

598,"Yes, it really does help. I have never been diagnosed with OCD simply because I've never been to a doctor to get myself checked, but I remember walking back 2 km just to check the lock on the door again. By the time I came to college, it was so bad that I will keep coming back repeatedly to check if I'd locked my room door (I was in a hostel). I had these weird notions about slippers and clothes, and thankfully my friends just thought me weird and abused me in the friendliest possible way. They never took it seriously.
That's when I started focusing on what I'm doing. I've been blessed with a photographic memory and my memory of faces is much better than my memory of names. So I just focus on each and every action that I make.
Then when I get the urge again, all I do is think back and ""replay"" my morning in my mind. And I know that I've locked the door, or done something else that I feel I've missed.
The problem with this is that whenever you do anything absent-mindedly, then you're in the soup. But over time, it gets so much better
I'm perfectly normal now and I've never had to ""re-check"" anything for years now. Not because I don't get the fear, but because starting from checking whether the gas is on to locking the house, I clear my mind out and ""focus"" on what I'm doing at that time.",OCD
599,"By the time I was in first grade, I had developed a series of increasingly elaborate rules for walking on floors of various types. It got to the point where it was difficult to walk anywhere at all.
So one day, I got angry. Enough was enough! There was absolutely no logical reason why anything bad would happen if I broke the rules. So I angrily flopped myself down on my bedroom floor - VERY much against the rules! - and forced myself to stay there until it no longer bothered me.
The thing about OCD - speaking for myself at least - is that it's not actually about ""The Rules"". That's a symptom. Somewhere in my brain, I had the real disease - a free-floating sense that something is terribly wrong. Our brains can't handle a free-floating anything, so they will attach it to the nearest available concrete thought.
(Is that picture crooked? Yes! It's WRONG. At last, I've found the evil that haunts me. I must fix it! Terrible things will happen if I don't. Yes, that's ridiculous, but...brains.)
And if you fix the stupid picture, you feel a moment of relief. And thirty seconds later, the OCD has attached to something else, and you keep chasing that moment of relief down an ever-deepening rabbit hole of crazy.
Exposure therapy forces you to get out of that cycle and confront the real disease. Once you do that, it loses a lot of its power. You can acknowledge the thoughts, but refuse to let it win.",OCD
600,Clomipramine has been shown to be mist effective but it really depends on the patient. SSRI’s are more commonly used because of the side effect profile. Keep in mind that these drugs when treating OCD are typically used in maximum doses to be effective treating OCD. Always combine any drug therapy with an OCD trained specialist using ERP techniques. In the long run the ERP will provide more benefits than the drugs. If you get good enough at therapy you likely won’t need the drugs anymore.,OCD
601,"It depends on the person, as both are used.
Clomipramine had been considered the “gold standard” for medication treatment of OCD, and is an excellent medication.
However, because of side effects in some people, other medications need to be considered, and sertraline or Zoloft is a common, generally effective choice.",OCD
602,"Zoloft, in my opinion, is the best SSRI to treat OCD. You must take super high dosages, anywhere between 200 mg to 300 mg per day, and allow up to two months before you see any improvement.",OCD

606,"The Zoloft along with Wellbutrin can help with OCD! I know you are probably thinking I'm crazy, but I'm not at all. Zoloft is an SSRI and Wellbutrin is a NDRI (Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitor), NOT an SSRI or an SNRI. So if you are on Zoloft and you don't think it's working to it's full potential, then your Dr can add Wellbutrin as a depression enhancer so that it will help your depression along or give it a bit of a boost, and you don't have to worry about serotonin syndrome. I take both, I have to in the winter months because of my Seasonal Affective Disorder and it does the job well. Ask your Dr if this choice could be right for you.",OCD
607,"Your psychiatrist’s opinion is so scientific. Probably, you had been on other medications as well like SSRIs or any other medication, too, however , you didn’t get enough therapeutic effects from them. It’s also probable that you have severe level of OCD as well. Clomipramine is indeed a potent medication germane to treating OCD or at least reducing the symptoms dramatically. According to the results of many studies, the overwhelming majority of the participants having OCD have found this med to be helpful and therapeutic germane to reducing OCD symptoms, some didn’t which is the case about any other medication. clomipramine is the most potent inhibitor of serotonin reuptake. It is sometimes described as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) – not an SSRI, because it also binds with high affinity to other receptors and reuptake sites. Generally speaking, OCD symptoms and depression symptoms are related to each other in many cases. OCD is a nervous condition wherein a person has recurring thoughts or ideas or does repetitive and compulsive things because they are anxious. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is been approved to work in the brain by increasing the activity of the chemical serotonin which can dramatically decrease nervousness and make the majority of people having OCD feel so much easy-going which per se would make many people having OCD become less and less carefree when it comes to doing compulsory actions. When doing things in a flawless way becomes less and less important to you, the symptoms of OCD will become not important to you as well. On another note, what you’re concerned about germane to its mechanism is true. Generally speaking, tricyclic antidepressants like this one work exclusively by inhibiting the reuptake process of Serotonin and norepinephrine as well. However, clomipramine induced mechanism of inhibiting the reuptake of Serotonin is more pronounced than other antidepressants. Through its mechanism, the levels of Serotonin and norepinephrine get so much more in your brain, however you shouldn’t worry about more norepinephrine in your brain due to the reason that a lot more Serotonin in the brain overshadows negative induced effects of norepinephrine which could make your OCD symptoms worse. The induced effects of a lot more Serotonin and norepinephrine actually could help with your OCD symptoms even more. Norepinephrine induced effects alone are so much different when combined with the induced effects of so much more Serotonin as well. Bear in mind that OCD is a deeply-seated and ingrained from of anxiety. Ergo, apart from any medication, one should change their mentality as well. You could take therapy sessions, too. Anyhow, medications help with OCD and the most potent one is what you’ve been prescribed, but you need to get a new perspective on life as well and fight any urge of perfectionism, conducting everything in the utmost way and so forth. You need to become less serious regarding doing any type of activity. You should get rid of the rules in your mind. You should come to the terms with this reality that everybody has follies and blind-spots and can make huge mistakes as well as brilliant decisions. All of us are human beings and so ordinary and there’s nothing wrong about it at all. I don’t suggest to sit on your hands and loaf around. Not at all. I rather recommend you to give any activity all you got, but never expect perfect and flawless outcomes. Never ever. Just deal with things in an appropriate way which you choose, but don’t get concerned or preoccupied with the rest at all. Just let the rest go and make attempts to erase all the rules and perfectionism off your mind. A psychologist can help you out a lot by putting you on the right track. That’s it and regarding the medication your psychiatrist made a research-based decision and prescribed you one of the most potent ones. As I stated earlier, at the end of the day, it all will boil down to you to erase all of the rules and anxious thoughts off your mind to break OCD.",OCD
608,Personally It turned me into an objectionable teenager who needed a good boot up the backside. Also the side effects were horrendous including what seemed like mini fits. It took the OCD away but I was left with a severe attitude problem. Scary scary stuff…for me anyway.,OCD
609,"I would have to say that based on clinical observation in treating thousands of patients with some form of anxiety disorder, sertraline (zoloft) is clearly superior on treating anxiety disorders comparing with escitalopram (lexapro). Zoloft had proved for my patients to be efficient in a large variety of anxiety disturbances such as panic disorder, GAD, phobias, anxiety with depression, irritable bowel syndrome and many other somatophorm disorders (pain, fibromyalgia) and even some conversive states , obsessive disorder and so one…Surely, there are exceptions and some individuals may respond better to escitalopram or may tolerate better escitalopram, but if you have anxiety that did not go well with other drugs, give Zoloft a try!",OCD

This can last for hours or days just thinking about how I lost my train of thought, why, in what situation, the subject matter, do I have cognitive impairment, the list goes on. And even though I know my cognition is fine that doesn’t stop the looping infinitely looping thoughts about train of thought.
Nothing really helps, there aren’t any medications that are very effective against pure O - whether that’s benzos or anti depressants. In my case they did nothing.
The only thing that helped was time and recognizing the problem as OCD, also I was able to find a way to say to myself who cares if it gets worse, who cares if I do get cognitive impairment, who cares if I can’t do anything I want to do and just drink all day, and eventually kill myself. So what who cares. And then this major obsession went away. This was after about 2.5 months of dealing with the torture.
my clinical psychologist and psychiatrist offered little in terms of fixing the problem except that saying that it doesn’t matter, and accept the obsessions, don’t compulse. Non of that helped very much. It was only me saying “who cares who cares who cares”, did the problem lift/evaporate.
basically I had very bad symptoms of pure O a few years ago for about 6 months then it just went away. I was hoping the same would happen this time but I’m still suffering some obsessions. Right now it’s an obsession about having psychosis (I also have schizoaffective disorder which makes things worse)
The obsessions are still bad but not as bad as the loss of train of thought obsession. I’ll be honest I’m back to drinking after taking 2 months off because I thought I had alcohol related brain injury, but that was just the obsessions talking. Still not good to be relying on alcohol and Valium to cope.
That’s the best I can explain it right now
I feel confident this current resurgence of symptoms of pure O will subside because that’s what has happened in the past. Also your subconscious plays a big role as to what you obsess about.
Anyone going through a similar thing I wish you well, you’re not alone",OCD
611,"Yes I do. My OCD came while I was in Army basic training at the age of 17. That was 1972. From then until I was 50 years old my OCD was pretty bad. From the beginning I went to various psychologists seeking help who I now know knew nothing about treating OCD. At around 50 years old I discovered the name of a psychologist who specializes in treating OCD. He discovered the original gold standard treatment for Pure O OCD. My treatment sessions were done via telephone as I lived in San Diego and he was in New York. In the beginning of the therapy the OCD actually got worse. After maybe 3 months it started getting better little by little. I stopped therapy after about 1 year. At that time I was not cured but I had no difficulty managing the OCD using the techniques the therapist taught me. It would have been great if it just stayed where it was. It continued on a similar path for probably 6 more months and then it just pooped out and left me alone. It was 100% gone. This was when I was 52 and since then I have had and will continue to have zero OCD symptoms. That was 12 years ago. I’m 64 now. My therapist and his OCD center below.

612,"Here’s my story, condensed from another (much longer) post —
At the worst of it:
I’d spend every morning crying at my doorstep after checking my locks, my kitchen stove, my windows, my electronics, my dryer, my hair straightener, and anything else that popped into my head for the twentieth time. I’d be an hour late to work and I felt utterly trapped between my fear and my obligations.
I’d be scared to leave my place for anything due to an unnatural fear that even the smallest incident might alter my life horribly.
I begged and pleaded my brain to stop obsessing over stuff at 3am so that I could have some semblance of sleep.
I was terrified that one inconsequential moment could set off any number of chain reactions that could be the end of it for me or someone else.
I was too afraid to talk to anyone for fear that they might exploit my anxiety.
I closed myself off from the world.
How I overcame it over the last 10 years:
I opened up and I started talking to others about it. By just asking a family member or friend to listen, I was able to hear my thoughts out loud and figure out what was rational and truly irrational.
I’d find anything to distract myself when it got overwhelming, and I did it until I was sufficiently distracted. (Btw, puzzles and Legos are great for people with racing minds who need something to concentrate on…)
I picked up more hobbies to keep my mind preoccupied. (I now design houses for the hell of it.)
It was nearly impossible, but I started learning to clear my head. Not in a meditation way because that never really worked for me. My go to was to say “It doesn’t really matter right now,” over and over. I still can’t believe that worked. But I knew shutting down my anxious thoughts outright might make my OCD worse. So I made my mind postpone those thoughts anytime they came up – until they fizzled out completely. (Most of the time too, repeating that in my head with emphasis would make me really tired and I would fall asleep after a bit.)
I was encouraged by family and friends to remind myself of my qualifications. So I’d recite them when I felt unsure of myself and it helped me build my self-confidence.
I started focusing more on others and listening to their stories. Not just ones about anxiety though, but good stories, bad stories, funny stories, emotional stories, and exciting stories.
I learned to be happy for and focus on others even when I was feeling completely overwhelmed and depressed. Seeing the good that was happening to others as something to celebrate helped me see even the smallest successes and opportunities that I had.
I also learned to encourage others to seek help. I was too stubborn to do so and it almost cost me my life a few times. It also meant that I spent a lot of time letting myself suffer through the pain when I could have been learning to work through it. (If any of this sounds familiar, don’t hesitate to talk to a therapist. Please don’t go it alone.)
Whatever you’re going through, just know what you’re not alone. Wishing you all the best in your journey!",OCD
613,"My OCD story is when I was 12 year old I started getting some mild symptoms of OCD, at that time I was not aware of what was happening to me, I started this when one day a light striked and I some how got so much scared, till that day to today I have suffered different types of ocd, it's been almost 15 years I am still struggling. Also in India no body understands it so I was very alone, I had no one to share my story, then I found this Home | Cromunity where I finally landed to a place where all understand each other, help each other and more importantly I don't feel alone now, I have my own friends who understands me",OCD
614,"I am a 14 year old female and I have just been diagnosed with OCD. Now that I have been diagnosed I believe that I have been suffering from OCD for a few years.
My journey to get to this diagnosis have been had been very hard and long.
I have an amazing therapist who I have been seeing for about 1 year now. I started to see her when I realised something was wrong.
Although she is a great therapist I am a very difficult client and found it very hard to talk. My OCD causes me to make sure that anything I say to her is exactly right and I have to ask her what she means exactly whenever she asks me a question. Lots of the time if I am spending too long working out what to say then I will give up and say I'm sorry I don't know. Because of this it took a long time to get anything important across.
I suffer from mostly obsessive thoughts rather than compulsive behaviours. I never completely understood that my obsessions were not normal as I thought that everyone thought like that or that I was just a stupid thing.
My first compulsion which really effected my life was when I started self harm. I know this doesn't really sound like compulsive behaviour and it didn't seem like it to me or my therapist at the time but now it is very obvious that it was in fact a compulsion. I believed that if I hurt myself every night until it felt right and finished then the next day I would be happy and if I didn't then the next day I would be really upset.
My compulsions change very dramatically and very quickly. The same day that my compulsion of self harm stopped I started to stop eating. I believed that if I did eat then my brain would be taken over by something bad and the bad thing would make me kill myself. I know this sounds strange but for some reason it made sense to me.
I go to a boarding school and it was only after the teachers found out that I hadn't eaten a thing for 2 weeks that things started to happen. I was sent home and then I had to go and see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist was amazing and mentioned to my therapist that I may have OCD. My therapist wasn't entirely sure and neither was I.
That was when my OCD started to get really bad and I started to get much stranger obsessive thoughts and my main compulsion changed to washing hands. Seeing my compulsion in a very relatable context for OCD meant that now my therapist thought that I might actually have OCD.
My OCD continued to get worse and worse so that I couldn't touch anything in case I got dirty and on bad days I wouldn't eat or drink because the cups or plates might be dirty.
My obsessions became constant so that I couldn't think of anything, do any work, sport or music which I normally loved to do.
When it got so bad that I would spend hours washing my hands and not complete any work I had a test for OCD and was diagnosed with severe OCD.
Although my obsessions have not got much better and I still can't really work properly having the diagnosis has helped understand my thoughts.
Before my diagnosis I thought that I was the only person who felt the way I did and that no one would be able to tell me what was wrong with me. I thought that it would never get better and so there was no point in living. I became very suicidal and depressed and found it hard to get up in the morning, move, speak or even write songs which I always did to help relieve myself of bad thoughts.
Now that I am diagnosed I am starting cbt which is very helpful and things are getting better even if they are still very tough.
So that is my story.
Sorry for how long this was and if you have managed to read down to here without getting bored then well done and thanks.",OCD
615,"First of all, do understand that even extreme OCD and anxiety can be overcome.
Try and get medical attention at all costs. In certain cases, there may be a chemical deprivation which warrants medicines.
Read motivating literature. Spirituality and understanding the meaning of life will help. Life mission should be greater than just buying a swanky car and house, what is your life mission.?
Do constructive activities ….help others, get into exercise…physical aspect is an important element of the process for chemical release.
Learn mindfulness. Understand the pattern of thoughts and triggers to anxious thoughts so you can nip them in the bud.
Understand that there are many people facing the same problem. Let the ‘why me’ syndrome go.
Practise deep breathing whenever you feel panicked or over anxious, however don’t overdo it.",OCD
616,"February 19th, 2016, I attempted suicide. I was struggling with mental illnesses and abusing alcohol and prescription medication.
I had to skip my exams in 2nd year of law and come home. Then, I started on the difficult journey to recovery and failed.
One night my mother caught me. I stole 200 rupees from her to buy alcohol. That night, she found my bottle of rum, and broke it on the kitchen sink.
Her palm was bleeding. Glass everywhere. Tears in her eyes.
She screamed, “Hirak, why? I can’t do this anymore!” That night, I ran away from home. Borrowed from a friend. Slept on the terrace.
2 years later, I was invited to speak at a college. By then, I was running a mental health NGO that’d helped 100’s of people like me. Those struggling. With their mental health -- and illness for free. My maa was in the audience. This was the first time, she saw me speak in public. I looked at her eyes : I saw pride. Single drop of tear escaped, for her to wipe it away. She smiled. It took me a second
to realize what I was feeling inside. Happiness : to be able to make my family proud. To walk back from the depths of desperation. If you’re there today, remember to not lose hope. No one’s beyond redemption. Not even a lonely drunk who tried to kill himself. Not even you..

617,"Honestly, it’s really just something you have to learn to cope with. It’s never going to completely disappear. I still struggle with these thoughts daily but some of the things that help me manage are medication, exposure-response techniques, writing the obsessive thought down and figuring out why I have the compulsion, opposite action, etc…",OCD
618,"I'm 25 now, but my journey with OCD began when I was just 11.
At first, the symptoms were mild—I'd count the steps I took, the tiles on the floor, even the number of times I blinked. It seemed harmless, almost like a habit.
My parents noticed, of course. They chuckled at first, thinking it was just a phase, something all kids do. But as time went on, and my counting became more intense, they began to worry. It wasn't just a habit anymore; it was affecting my everyday life.
The school was where it started to show. I couldn't focus in class because I was too busy counting the words the teacher said or the number of pencils on my desk. My teacher would call me undisciplined and stubborn. And I believed it. This was the point where my self-esteem and confidence were at an all-time low.
And as a result, my grades started to suffer. That's when my parents knew they had to intervene. They took me to see a doctor, hoping for some answers. And it was a relief to finally put a name to what I was experiencing—OCD.
The diagnosis was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it explained why I was struggling so much. On the other hand, it meant facing the reality that this wasn't something I could ignore.
So at around 12, therapy became a regular part of my routine, and I started to learn how to manage it.
Today, at 25, after 8 years of therapy, I’m no longer taking therapy. I can manage it on my own now. I’ve learned to recognize the signs and use coping strategies to keep them in check.
It's been a long and sometimes difficult journey, but I'm grateful for how far I've come.",OCD
619,"I would like to share my journey with mental illness, the start, and the continuous fight..!! I would also like to address a different kind of stress in my life, one that motivated me to fight and others that incapacitated me.
It approached me silently 4 Years back. Since, then, things never remained the same , it just got better from the worse.
I want to share what are all the events that might have contributed to that. Maybe this will give me closure and anyone else, who has gone through or going through a similar state, may know that they are not alone.
People who have not gone through it, it may give them an idea, what it feels like.
First exposure to stress and anxiety- IIT and AIEEE preparation.
I faced it valiantly. I failed, I rose, I fought back consistently for long 36 months and won. Today, when I look back, it only makes me feel proud that how from very limited resources, 14-year-old me managed and achieved my goal. Though I missed the bull's eye, IIT, I did good enough to get into NIT. Though this journey had a lot of pit stops full of stress and disappointment, still it inspires me and acts as a Power source for me.
College life- I was a part of a class of 90 students out of which there were only 8 girls. I was bullied and harassed by a huge group of boys in my class. Except for physical harassment, everything was tried. Cyberbullying, calling out names, drawing obscene figures on my desk, onboard, on the attendance sheet, creating fake obscene FB account and not by one boy but a group of boys on an almost daily basis for long 7 months. Out of these boys, One guy was even my acquaintance whom I knew before joining college. The reason for all this harassment was that I spoke up against the mass-bunk and then later I stood against each and every harassment for long 7 months of my first year. I still can't imagine how relentlessly I kept fighting and how a 17-year-old, who never experienced anything like that kept her head high and fought hard. Please note that these were group(more than 20, for sure) of boys in my class in NIT. we had a committee in our college to deal with these issues, but, it took me long to take this issue to his notice because I thought what if this bullying and harassment increases, I don't have concrete evidence (according to me) and what if I am blamed for what is happening to me and also, I thought maybe it will stop on its own. But, it did not, I still remember it started from fresher's day and continued till the end of the second semester.
But, anyway, I am thankful to the Dean student of my college, these things were taken pretty seriously and the situation was handled very diligently by him and after that, it almost stopped.
Also, in the second year, the class got shuffled and I was able to get rid of most of them.
But, it created a kind of fear in my mind. I was scared somewhere and was not able to express my views with the same vigor and confidence as I used to. I started thinking and overthinking about each and every step that I took. For years, I felt,it happened to me, maybe, because, I was vocal and opinionated. It stayed with me for long 4-5 Years till the time I gained the maturity and perspective that no, those people who did so were wrong, it was them, not me. It was their fault and fault in their character.
But, I just, imagine, what if my college did not have any such body, what if, I was not heard, what I would have done in such a scenario.
3rd year to 4th year- I developed multiple health issues that stayed with me for 3 long years. I was in constant pain and suffering. But, I fought through that too somehow and did not let this darkness reach me.
After college- I moved to a new city, the city was awesome, my friends were awesome, I already learned to live with my health issues and felt I am now a strong independent girl. But, little did I know, that this is not enough. I had to behave differently in office and act like a professional, take care of all my needs and I was adapting to it. But, slowly that darkness started approaching me. I did not have my defense- my family close to me. I was not ready to handle everything on my own but I acted and thought as I can. I had a heartbreak too around the same time. I did not know that was the last thing that it was waiting for.
But, I moved on. After a few months, I started having an urge to cry at night and I did not know why. According to me, I dealt with all my problems. Slowly, that urge to cry engulfed my mornings too. My job required a lot of interaction with different stakeholders that mean a lot of discussions on ideas and presentations. But, I did not let anyone know, that I cry. I used to lock myself in restroom cry before any major presentation/discussion and then go ahead. I thought I am homesick, so my visits to home increased. I did well at home and that urge to cry reduced while I used to be at home. But, my home was 2000kms away, I could not visit every month. Slowly, that urge to cry converted into heaviness and then after few months into palpitation and palm sweats. I stopped writing, painting, sketching, became distant from my friends, irritable and slowly, I felt even my friends ignored me during that time, maybe because I was sad, irritable, unhappy except for 1 or 2 friends.
I simply used to go to the office to perform at my work and come back. One thing, that kept me moving, was my work and my urge to perform there. It started taking me longer to finish some work but then, I had to perform as well. This meant, I used to work an almost full day with my laptop next to me (24*7).
I cried every night to bed for long 1 year,
After 1.5 years, into my job, my grandfather passed away. I was very close to him and a few months later, my father fell sick. I felt a dark hollow space where all my emotions were engulfed. I had to be responsible to my family and my mom now. Out of my 3 pillars- 2 were down. This stopped me from sharing any issues with my mom because I did not want to bother her more. I started gaining weight and my food habits became irregular. Few days, I will not eat at all, and a few days I will binge on whatever I could get.
It started getting worse. It wrung every drop of happiness out of me and the worst part was that I was not even aware that something is wrong with me and that I am in depression or there is a clinical condition. I used to live on the 16th floor of a building and sometimes that height from the ground used to attract me. The thought-if somehow, I can stop all this felt better than anything else.
And during these dark nights- everything, my bad experience, the incident in college, my health issues used to haunt me together.
It stayed with me for around 1.5 years. By the end of 2016, I saw an interview with Dipika Padukone where she spoke about depression. I realized I am going through worse and for long. But, I thought oh my god..!! I am going Cuckoo..!! (which is not correct, I was totally ignorant about this issue then). My fighter spirit ignited within me. I started reading about it. My typical approach to anything- read and read a lot about it. It said, try to have a routine, follow your hobbies and TALK TO A FRIEND.
I tried doing all that. I reached out to my friends (mind it: few I have not been in touch within last few months/years), I told them what I am feeling, but no one could understand and said ""it's okay"", try to stay happy, and don't be sad.
These attempts further shut me down. It became worse. I don't blame my friends, they also might not have known about it as I was also unaware for good 2 years and hence, they can not understand that what exactly I was going through.
Finally, I took medical help. Within 14 days, my urge to cry reduced and I could sleep for 2-3 hours continuously. But, there are a lot of other side effects that come along with this. My blood pressure used to dip, I used to feel a sudden chill or everyone sounding too loud around me. But, after 3 months it got better. I changed my job and felt much better.
I thought, I am over it and left it behind.
BUT, I WAS WRONG.
It keeps lurking in dark, and, every time my shield was down, it engulfed me.
With time and maturity, I have devised an approach that works for me. There is no one size that fits all scenario here, so, you will have to understand and figure out, what works best for you.
Cut out toxic people from your life asap.
Don't carry the dead weight of so-called friends who are actually not. They may not be toxic. My trick to check that- Can I call that person anytime and discuss my problems and will he/she listen to me? Answer -no-- chop-chop.
Focus on your career and your ties with your family. Whatever may happen, your family and your career is the only thing that will stay with you. Create real and strong connections at work. Create a professional network to keep learning.
Talk to someone who has actually gone through depression and won the battle. If, that is not possible, approach your friend or family member who is less judgemental, gossips less, and a good listener. Do not discuss with someone who is already depressed.
Do seek professional help and complete the treatment.
After, completing treatment, Whenever, you feel like going into the same dark space again- take a break and relax and do nothing. Identify your symptoms and be ready. Try to listen to your mind and body- it tells you. Identify those and take care of them.
I am stronger than before and know myself better now.
I was lucky to have invested my time in building true friends and never underestimated the importance of family.",OCD
620,I feel sorry for anyone who has to deal with it. It’s not something I’d wish upon anyone. It’s not fun. It’s like living life with a devil in your head making you do all these things long after you want to stop.,OCD
621,"Thank you for the request.
What’s it like to live with OCD?
Imagine this… you are sitting in a room and you see something that looks wrong. You attempt to ignore it. Someone comes into the room and tells you that there is something wrong. If you fix what you believe is wrong, the person leaves the room and you are alone again. Peaceful don’t you think? Now take the other path…
You are in a room, you think something is wrong and you do nothing about it, a person comes into the room and tels you to fix it, you ignore it and then another person enters the room, tells the first person who tells you, the second person tells you too. Now this goes on in true Factorial mathematics until all you hear is an infinity worth of people telling to to fix it. What a noise, you can not do anything else as your entire thought process is taken over by these infinite amout of people and guess what? You are not schizophrenic. When you fianlly do something about it, you finally get rid of the people and the noise. Now, change the people to bouncing balls hitting a pole that says.. ‘fix it’.
Now this is only one analogy, i have many more but hopefully you get the drift of the story. Your entire mind is taken over by a desire or urge to do something and the urge does not pass until you have done what you need to do.
Now me, cleanliness, spacing, squareness is a must. Also, I cannot eat with my hands, my hands do not touch food. To,stop cleaning my hands all the time, i wear gloves. You want me to stop talking, move something on my desk out of alignment. I have to stop to fix it or I do it automatically. Quite a game when you know a person has OCD and you do this just to get them annoyed. On the cleanliness, not all people clean the same, if you start cleaning, 24 hours later you have a clean house but no friends or family.
Hope this helps! Sometimes, OCD is debilitating, it controls your life and puts stress on all relationships personal and professional.",OCD
622,"It is extremely stressful. In OCD, the thoughts are extremely uncomfortable and causes anxiety.
Imagine, you are trying to do something but at the same time you are having automatic intrusive thoughts about something that bothers you. It becomes a living nightmare. Then we start doing compulsions to make sure that whatever thoughts you are getting are not right. You start having dialouges and forget the work you were doing initially.
The stress is immense because, firstly these obsessions cause a lot of stress and then we waste time in doing the compulsions. At the same time, since many of us are either studying or working we are not able to do work easily,this adds up to the stress.
Idea is to understand the changes that are taking place in your daily life. You have to make sure that you don't lose control of your mind.
It will become worrisome if not controlled well.",OCD
623,"Living effing hell for me. Every time I was in the car I had to blink a number of times between every sign. When my mouth moved I had to move it on the other side as well. When I tapped my foot I had to do it a certain number of times with the other one. When I had an itch I counted how many touches or fingers I laid on my skin and did the exact same thing on the other side of me. Every time I touched a pen I would have to click it a number of times until I was satasfied. You get the gist. Mine was i n t e n s e. Like, so bad it hurts to recall. Then, every time I missed a step in my rituals I had a small panic attack. My mouth would dry out and I would constantly whisper, “let me do it again confirm confirm confirm, that didn’t matter, Redo redo, okay confirm.” Like a computer program kind of. I would do that until I felt safe. Some people when they do their rituals are afraid of something bad happening to them. Like a break-in or loss of loved ones. For me it was fire. I would be afraid that my family was going to die in a fire for so long, because on New Years my dad’s truck burned to the ground and we had to get out of the house. You get a lot of anxiety with OCD too, you are just so afraid of what ritual you may have to do next. You could get a mosquito bite and itch like crazy, you could bump a thigh on something or someone and have to awkwardly bump the other.
TLDR: a lot of repetition, panic attacks and anxiety. PLEASE be kind and understanding to anyone you may know with this disorder.",OCD
624,"I was one a child with OCD.
I dont know how it started but Ive had OCD ever since I could remember.
My mind was sooo clouded by all these irrational, scary, repetitive thoughts that I had no spare time to think about anything else in the world.
I remember being 10 years old and I couldnt even understand the concept of a wall clock and how to read it, I was the dumbest in school, always being threatened to get kicked out, while my twin sister was the smartest, always ranking first, olympics and such. My thoughts would be filled with all these nonsense about repeating patterns I would find everywhere; alphabets, numbers, steps, down to the ridges of my fingers, its hard to explain, but I remember my head was so clouded by it all day long it was like a constrained routine I had made for myself, all driven by my fear of death.
I would also make clicking sounds with my mouth, of course, with patterns and repetition that never seemed to end. It was only one of the countless things I would do in public in order to relieve my “need” of repetition. It had gotten to the point where people around me are irritated by me, my parents, my schoolmates, I became socially anxious. People always think Im weird, I couldnt fit anywhere.
My family? I would barely see my dad as he is a very busy business man, my mom saw my OCD as no other than annoyance and always scold me with hurtful words. She didnt really care about me as she has got 2 other daughters with excellent academic performance she would gladly give all her attention to. My sisters always thought I was weird, they destroyed a teddy bear my dad had given me, the teddy was my sanctuary, a friend who would never judge me and always there for me like nobody else ever been. I was alone in this world.
I also remember how I could only sleep after all the curtains have been perfectly closed, my blankets wrinkle-free, all the toys arranged, bla bla bla to the smallest details of dust and bits until i could finally go to sleep at 2 am, as if that wasnt enough, I would constantly go back and forth to wash my hands with soap in the middle of the night, whenever I close the bathroom door I had to rub the round door handle 3 times( i know its weird) and I was only 8 years old at that time. Everything was hard for me, especially when everyone around me kept pushing me down even more with their ignorance and lack of sympathy and affection.
When Im asked to recall my childhood, all I feel is anxiety; a constant worry of all the irrational habits I used to do, and the horrible thoughts that came along with it, always circulating around death. Never a day in my childhood where I was worry-free.
Everything changed when my family moved house, it was the center of the town, few hours car ride away from the old house. Suddenly it was as if I opened my eyes for the first time in my life. Im not sure how to explain it. I went from the dumbest, most despised person in my school to being the top 3 for years in a row at my new school. I learned alot of things, the world was very new to me, and I was ready to explore everything it has to offer. I continued to strive in my education, I jumped a few grades, my IQ was around 140, etc. and now Im studying Art in a university.
After further research I found out that a change of environment could help with OCD but its hard to believe it could go to this extent..
Even though I still have depression and bipolar disorder as a result of the OCD that filled my entire childhood, Im content, and im grateful that Ive been given a chance in life.
Just to give a glimpse of my everyday life in my childhood, this is how my morning would go;
When I get off the bed in the morning, my feet would have to touch the floor at the same time with all my soles touching the ground, repeat until done perfectly. when I walk I have to count my steps and finish with an even number by the time I get to the bathroom, i have to touch the bathroom handle with my full grip perfectly and then turn it, I brush my teeth at least twice, wash my hands between every insignificant action all the while brushing my teeth etc. I would put on my school uniform over and over til I think its just right, then check all the curtains open and tidied up as its supposed to be before leaving home, and also to put on my shoes repeatedly until i think its just right.
This will go on forever tbh im tired goodnight",OCD
625,"OCD can be very stressful, but it all comes down to how willing you are to counter your thoughts. The intrusive thoughts, specifically the sexual ones, make you feel guilty and question your morality. These thoughts are often about those who really shouldn't be in the picture, which makes it worse. But trust me, feeling guilty about having these images just makes it harder for you to recover. Like I always tell people, you have to tell yourself that these are not your thoughts and you must not take their responsibility. Your mind is messing with you, it does that to everyone. Give yourself positive affirmations. Write these affirmations on a paper and repeat them in front of the mirror every morning when you wake up. Affirmations like ""I am not the one who's generating these thoughts. Therefore I take no responsibility."" ""I have no reason to feel guilty about anything, I am not at fault"". When you give your brain such positivity, it starts responding likewise.
As far as the compensatory behaviour is concerned, the stigma related to it is so depressing. Someone opening and closing the refrigerator's door 7 times in a row gets mocked and no one really cares if they have a medical condition. More than the manifestation of the disorder, the societal pressure makes it hard for the person to cope. These rituals are a result of the fear that is generated by the OCD thoughts. Once you learn to validate your thinking, you'll be able to take charge of your actions.
Easier said than done. All of this is very overwhelming to know. But like I said, strong will power, and you can shake mountains. Go to a therapist who would show you the way. It's you who has to walk through it.
And yes, there's nothing to worry about. There is no illness in this world that is mightier than the will of a human being. Proceed with a positive approach and you will discover some of your capabilities that you yourself didn't know about.
Good luck",OCD
626,"I have been diagnosed with OCD for only a couple of months now but I believe that I have suffered from it for the past few years.
I never really saw myself as having OCD as I never had the ‘normal’ OCD symptoms.
When it first started out it was all in my head. I realise that it wasn't completely OCD yet but this is where I notice the beginnings of it:
In my head I always knew that there wasn't just me in there. This must be really hard for someone without a mental illness to understand but to anyone with a mental illness it is all too familiar. I would describe some thoughts as ‘mine’ and some thoughts as ‘its’. Recently I have started to call ‘it’ a ‘him’ because that feels like the best way to portray my OCD thoughts. I would get random thoughts that I must do certain things but I didn't really know why. I carried on and did those things even though I knew that they were not ‘my’ thoughts telling me it. My main obsession lays around having mental illnesses. Fora year or so this was the only symptom which may have been OCD and I didn't really have any compulsions. In my head my OCD would become fixated on a certain mental illness for a couple of months but would come back to its ‘favourites’ from time to time. I would be going around my daily life and I would get a random thought popping into my head saying something like ‘I am too happy at the moment, I have to be sad now because otherwise I won't have depression’ (I never actually had depression at that time, of which I am aware of). These thoughts horrified me and I kept them buried inside of me as I thought that if I told anyone they wouldn't understand and think I was attention seeking.
I started therapy when my OCD told me to start self harming. I didn't know why I did it, all I knew was that I HAD to. My therapist thought that I depressed (which maybe I was at this point because of all of the thoughts) but I couldn't tell her the truth because she wouldn't understand.
Later my OCD decided that self harm wasn't enough and that I must stop eating as well. As soon as it had said that there was no going back. I would get a plate of food with the intention of eating it but then find that I was unable of moving my arm to put the food into my mouth. After 2 weeks straight of not eating a thing I was told that I had to leave my school and I wasn't to come back before I ate or I would have to go into hospital. I was then sent to a psychiatrist who told me I had OCD. This was such a shock as I could never see how I had OCD from not eating and because everyone else had told me I was anorexic which I knew I wasn't.
My OCD means that I am extremely impressionable so say I was talking to someone else with OCD who was talking about having to check the doors 8 times before leaving the house I would then find that the next day I would have to do the exact same thing because my OCD had decided it was a good idea.
This made me feel like I was making all of it up for attention and sent massive essay long emails to my therapist confessing how I had made it all up for attention and that I was a liar and a horrible person. She was great and kept giving me reassurance that I wasn't lying and that it was real.
So the day after the psychiatrist told me I had OCD I got obsessed with germs. I stopped touching anything and was petrified of everything. 2 months later I am getting a little bit better but the only thins I will touch are my home plates and cutlery and my phone. Everything else I use gloves or my sleeves.
Through this time I have gone through the obsessions of tapping everything.
I believed that if I didn't tap everything then something bad would happen to my best friend or family. I believed that if I didn't tap everything 3 times after properly touching it then my germs would be on it and pass to other people and get them sick and make them die.
I had the obsession that if thins weren't exactly straight and perfect then someone would get hurt or possibly even die and it would be my fault. This only really happens now in dangerous situations (mats not straight in trampolining training, desks not lined up in exam room, sand not perfectly raked in long jump).
I am now also going through an obsession with numbers. I have to do EERYTHING 1, 3 or 8 times. I count everything and if something is not done a right number of times I have to do it again until it is right.
I am now getting therapy for my OCD but it isn't working that well. My psychiatrist has mentioned staying in a psychiatric ward for a bit so I can do exposure every day but I really don't want that to happen so I am trying so hard to get better.
So this is my story of OCD. If anyone actually managed to read to the end then thanks and well done!!! \U0001f602",OCD
627,"I started having noticeable symptoms in my teens. I didn't know it was abnormal, I just assumed I was a deep thinker.
As I got older the thoughts and images got more difficult to deal with.
Better said, if you don't have OCD, let me paint the picture of what it can be like to have it:
You will have thoughts/images about something VERY important to you. These thoughts will tell you there is a problem in this area you MUST fix. The images you get are so disturbing, it's almost impossible to live a functional life at times.
And this happens over, and over, and over.
If you try to ignore it, then it intensifies. If you try to reason with it, it will present more “evidence” and you will lose.
It is exhausting and very, very hurtful. At times, you want to just shut down and cry.
Because the obsessions hit you where you are MOST vulnerable. Whatever area that is.
It took a long time in therapy for me to learn how to appropriately manage it. A difficult road, but well worth it.
I encourage anyone who has OCD to not try and mitigate the problem on your own.
Seek therapy and stick with it 🙂",OCD
628,"Strictly speaking, it never worried me. It irritated the hell out of me. To be honest, I've never been diagnosed with OCD, but when I was young, there was nothing called OCD. I was just ""Weird"", and my friends used to make fun of me.
One of the good things about my compulsive behaviour however is that I want to find the solution to any problem. All I did was apply that to my behaviour, and over time I managed to control it.
Even now, I'm pretty good with people, not because I'm a natural extrovert or anything. It's just that starting my early teen years, I've studied, yes I mean ""studied"" human interaction, and I've got all the rules pat in my head. All I have to do is apply the rules to any situation, and that's that.
I'm not saying that this will work for everyone. There are varying degrees of compulsive behaviour and I may have had a very minor disorder. My view however is that compulsive behaviour, like all behaviour, gets worse with repetition. And because it's a ""compulsive"" behaviour, you tend to repeat said behaviour. So it's a vicious cycle, and unless you stop the cycle somewhere, it's only going to get worse.",OCD
629,"At the worst of my OCD, I’d spend every morning crying at my doorstep after checking my locks, my kitchen stove, my windows, my electronics, my dryer, my hair straightener, and anything else that popped into my head for the twentieth time. I’d be an hour late to work and I felt utterly trapped between my fear and my obligations. I’d be scared to leave my place for anything due to an unnatural fear that even the smallest incident might alter my life horribly. I begged and pleaded my brain to stop obsessing over stuff at 3am so that I could have some semblance of sleep. I was terrified that one inconsequential moment could set off any number of chain reactions that could be the end of it for me or someone else. I was too afraid to talk to anyone for fear that they might exploit my anxiety. And I closed myself off from the world.
But I learned to overcome it by:
Opening up and I started talking to others about it. By just asking a family member or friend to listen, I was able to hear my thoughts out loud and figure out what was rational and truly irrational.
Finding anything to distract myself when it got overwhelming, and I did it until I was sufficiently distracted. (Btw, puzzles and Legos are great for people with racing minds who need something to concentrate on…)
Picking up more hobbies to keep my mind preoccupied.
It was nearly impossible, but I started learning to clear my head. Not in a meditation way because that never really worked for me. My go-to was to say “It doesn’t really matter right now,” over and over. I still can’t believe that worked. But I knew shutting down my anxious thoughts outright might make my OCD worse. So I made my mind postpone those thoughts anytime they came up – until they fizzled out completely. (Most of the time too, repeating that in my head with emphasis would make me really tired and I would fall asleep after a bit.)
Being encouraged by family and friends to remind myself of my qualifications. So I’d recite them when I felt unsure of myself and it helped me build my self-confidence.
Starting to focus more on others and listening to their stories. Not just ones about anxiety though, but good stories, bad stories, funny stories, emotional stories, and exciting stories.
Learning to be happy for and focus on others even when I was feeling completely overwhelmed and depressed. Seeing the good that was happening to others as something to celebrate helped me see even the smallest successes and opportunities that I had.
And learning to encourage others to seek help. I was too stubborn to do so and it almost cost me my life a few times. It also meant that I spent a lot of time letting myself suffer through the pain when I could have been learning to work through it. (If any of this sounds familiar, don’t hesitate to talk to a therapist. Please don’t go it alone.)
It’s not completely gone, and I know it likely never will be. But I learned to cope, slowly and surely over the course of a decade. I learned that pretty much everyone has intrusive thoughts, but most people don’t think much of it. I learned not to fight the compulsions, but to retrain my brain, avoid triggers if I could, and figure out what was I was truly worried about. Those things made a world of difference for me.
Whatever you’re going through, just know what you’re not alone. Wishing you all the best in your journey!",OCD
630,"OCD is one of the most misused terms these days. It is some what a fashion statement to have OCD, but in reality OCD is a serious problem. People suffering from OCD can greatly benefit from some therapy.
However your wife might not have OCD, she just likes to be clean. That is perfectly normal. Your first task is to find out if she actually suffers from OCD.
Do I have OCD? | OCD Action | The UK's largest Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Charity
The above link is a test that might help to an extent.
If she just likes things clean, it is not OCD. You just have different levels of cleanliness as people. Both of you have will have to work to find a middle ground. You too will have to change your habits for her and vice versa.
If you find her to have a serious OCD , talk to a qualified therapist.",OCD
631,"I am writing this to your wife, hence the “you” term. I also have cleaning OCD + number and repetitive OCD.
First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems. Because if you do try to overcome this alone, you will relapse multiple times resulting in a worse relapse every time. I can speak on behalf of my self and thousands of other people with OCD or compulsive behavior.
Second you should make a private list of your goals and then work it out together with your appointed doctor. The list should include:
Why do I want this?
Who am I doing it for? (The answer should ALWAYS be yourself, but you have to mean it a 100%)
A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your head scream and stand in the moment until the pain subsides. This proves to yourself that you are capable of restraining yourself. You have free will, and you will conquer. This is called Exposure Therapy. Face your fears, and prove yourself right.

Finally, I want to end this with saying: You are not your compulsions. You are a strong human being. You can and you will do this, because you deserve a beautiful life and everything you have to offer. You don’t deserve to be a prisoner of your own illness. If there’s anything that exposure therapy has proven me, it’s that the fear/anxiety/urges and whatnot’s that comes out of not doing my compulsions, is that it always goes away after about 30–45 seconds. The most extreme part of a panic attack subsides after 15 minutes. It is not humanly possible to be at the top at the curve of a panic attack for more than 15 minutes. It may still be uncomfortable. But your worst panic symptoms will always fade after 15 minutes. You will never die off an anxiety or panic attack. And every time you reach the top of the curve, the top is further down then it was the last time you were at the top of your curve. And eventually the top of the curve will be like any other “Uh oh or hell no’s” you experience with other things that makes you feel iffy. Everyone has OCD to some extend, but they usually forget about the intrusive thought and go about their normal lives. You will finally reach this target if you work hard enough. Accept your fears. Don’t work against them, but also don’t allow them to happen. Tell yourself that it’s ok to fell this way. That this isn’t you, but it still makes you afraid, and that is okay. Everyone is afraid of something, and this, right here, right now, is making you scared or anxious. The sooner you accept this, the easier and faster you will learn to overcome it. It’s much easier to get out of a hell house if you’ve accepted that there’s a rabid serial killer trying to kill you. you will remain level headed, you will not freak out and you will find solutions to your problems. And finally, there you found the exit. On to the next problem.
So come on, let your beautiful self be able to control you!

(I have OCD and I know too much about compultsons, obsessives, anxiety and all that.)

I really, really hope this helps you in any way!",OCD
632,"I am going to assume your wife has OCD.
I think not trying to help her stop a compulsion would be useful thing #1
Help her feel like it is ""ok"" that she has a compulsion would be really good start. She is likely going through self loathing with the fact that you even have to be exposed to her compulsions. Get her to talk about her triggers and compulsions and show sympathy with it being hard without making it seem like she is a freak. The triggers are probably irrational. It is ""ok"" to acknowledge they are weird without making her feel like she is weird. Also, she is probably more concerned about the noise that it all makes than with anyone particular irrational thing. Expressing sympathy about the noise is nice to hear.
Understand what triggers her compulsions. This involves things like rating the intensity of triggers on a scale between 1-10. Do not mess with any compulsions that were triggered by a 7 or above. Work on...

633,"All you need to do is practically let her know through actions.
Roughly estimate how much time and resources (like water, tissues etc) she is wasting in the name of OCD.
Do something which makes her think that is unnecessary as of now. Like spending more time in gardening, ignoring her words oftenly.
Yes she will be mad or disheartened.
Let her know that you also feels same when she is more concerned about OCD and how it makes you mad.
Let her know how it is annoying you, she don’t understand unless you express something to her. She can’t read your mind.

634,"People may think that its a normal habit, but when it crosses the limit, it irritate other family members also forces us to think that there is something abnormal.
Hopefully, it may not OCD but there must be a matter of fact behind her certain kind of behaviour of keeping herself occupied to get away from anxiousness or sufferings.
Try to find the reason behind. Keep sharing your daily routine to make her feel comfortable so that she would be encouraged automatically to tell you everything.
However, specialists are always there, if you find it difficult to tackle with this problem yourself.
But I would suggest, being a husband; you must be the specialist of almost every matter of your wife (This rule is applicable vice - versa also).

It is like a habit one inherits from a very young age and not only me but the world knows that it is one good habit to keep room, oneself clean and tidy always.
All you can do is help her too, not by becoming like her because you are also a different person but by giving a hand to her like Do the dishes sometimes, sweep the floor when you mess it up yourself sometimes or by not messing anything up more for her to clean (I mean I don't know if you are one who does that or doesnt do anything at all but these are some activites that you can help her with )

636,"I only know from the viewpoint that my mother had cleaning OCD when I was young and living at home.
We didn't know it was a condition.
I think that eventually, once she had recognised it she felt resentment towards the time it had taken away from her/us during my childhood.
The condition needs treatment and your parent needs professional help and I don't think there is much else you CAN do, until your parent can see the problem and is willing to go for help. Reaching that point, is a challenge
One of the things that I struggled with was when I was wanting to help my Mum, any attempt on my part that inferred “you have a problem” caused an emotional reaction that was inevitable: it caused upset.
And upset caused the cleaning frenzy to intensify.
I thought that if I helped with the cleaning that it might help remove some stress for her - I waited for her to go shopping, I asked “why don't you want to go shopping?” She said “I need to clean the bath”
I persuaded her out of the door and set to work with cleaning products.
I was thorough and it sparkled.
The thing is, it ALWAYS sparkled. And I knew I was cleaning something that I couldn't see a fleck of dirt on. I assumed that mum was seeing dirt that I couldn't see.
So, I didn't mention the bathroom because I assumed that she'd she the flecks of whatever she'd seen WERE GONE.
nope. She came in, drank two cups of tea and smoked two cigarettes and then spent an hour re-cleaning the bathroom.
I wasn't old enough to know enough about the world to understand it was a condition I couldn't help
It caused me distress. I felt like nothing I could do was good enough. I felt undermined.
I DID NOT recognise her need stemmed from more of a repetitive instinctual behaviour that she wasn't in control of and she was in as much emotional isolation with it as I was.
I took it all personally, I felt that If I could be a better daughter and stronger against my stepdad (he was domineering in their relationship) and more challenging of him, I thought that was me stepping up to the mark
Those efforts created an emotionally turbulent home environment - the air was constantly charged with tension.
Again, I think I made it worse.
It good intentions could cure someone else's mental health problems then we'd be able to save lives whilst sat in bed!
Unfortunately, good intentions don't have that power and neither do many loved ones who are in a situation were they are observing OCD behaviour.
The best way (I think) you can help a love one is by accepting that all you can do is offer unconditional love - and if you can, help them get help, if you can remind them of appointment and maybe drive them there if need be.
And I know it's the hardest thing in the world to accept “there are limitations in what you can do it help” because so many of us take it personally when somebody we care about has lost their way to mental illness and we feel stuck, and don't know what more we can do to help.
All we can hope to do is ease any emotional trubulence they feel around us: I mean, it's important to appear solid in who we are - they need to see “it's ok, we are ok” and then hope that at least we may be someone who is consistent - in the sense of not dropping in traumatic reminders of stuff that can trigger panic or unnessary stress.
I'm sure you don't, won't or whatever, it sounds like you hold kindness close to how you are seeing your Mum..
It's ever so hard not to place blame on these situations - I blamed my mum when I didn't realise she has no choice in her actions because of the nature of OCD.. AND then I blamed myself, then my stepdads and then back to myself “I should have helped more”
I really hope that it doesn't take the same path for you, because nowadays there are treatments available and it really isn't your fault, it's impossible for it to be a child's fault.
The seeds of it are probably sewn before we were even born, so it's hardly our fault and we can't let ourselves feel guilty (like we might when we are children) because they can see it in our eyes and that can trigger symptoms.
Ive just remembered - my Mum has a very keen interest in wildlife and I suspect that when that love for nature was nurtured, she became a brilliant gardener. She can identify every single wild thing I have ever found, whether it's a fossil (I found an ancient squid ink bladder, I can't even remember what it's called but she knows that stuff from off the top of her head) in Latin and the same goes for plants, mosses and lichens.
She didn't receive any treatment for the OCD
But I suspect there came a point when she found interests that have her the joy of knowledge. And in some ways I don't think the OCD ever entirely left her, it can be seen in that thirst for knowledge and the way she can germinate seeds of all types into en masse armies of foliage.
The greens came marching in and obsessions and compulsions lead to her creating something beautiful and nurturing.
It came good in the end for her",OCD

640,"I don't think it worsen with age but do worsen with time!
The more the patient condition himself, the more the connection gets stronger.
Let's say whenever the doorbell doesn't ring at 8, I tend to get nervous and anxious and thus, to eliminate the anxiousness I tap my finger or keep hitting the table.
This could be treated easily in the initial stage but if the patient isn't given treatment, it might worsen with time. Because the only way to eliminate the obsession is that compulsive act and the bond would grow stronger with time.
Thus it would be relatively tough to treat OCD if it's been there for a long time.
Thus I feel age isn't a criteria here for OCD to worsen but it's time.

641,"I have contamination related OCD. Even though diagnosed when i was 27 years, when i look back, the first ocd symptom i demonstrated was when i was around 8 to 10 years…. I suffer from lot of guilt feelings as well. Add the fact that i am sort of less confident guy. And those who know OCD, guilt and doubt (lack of confidence) is breeding ground for OCD.
Once diagnosed, i am guilty of stopping medication on and off. The reason for stopping medication was the unbearable side effects and sometimes i do well without medicines for years together. But once some trigger point occurs , the hell returns..
From my personal experience as i have aged, my OCD is getting triggered more frequently and taking more time to come under control. But this is also due to inconsistency in taking my medicines that have high side effects.
So if you are not taking your medicines, yes OCD worsens with time.
But i think most OCD people dont like the side effects of their medications and tend to discontinue as they get the illusion that they are all right",OCD
642,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD is not an age specific condition, it typically starts between 18 and 25 years. However, the first onset of symptoms is more likely to occur between the ages 10 and 12, i.e. late teens and early adulthood. The condition is characterized by obsessions and compulsions and classified under the umbrella of anxiety disorders. People suffering from the disorder live under a persistent threat and fear of safety. They are constantly checking on people, things or items in general, fearing contamination, ill-intentions and anticipating the worst. Hence, they are often found to be obsessed with germs, dirt, cleanliness, locks and security.
Although there are no concrete findings to substantiate worsening of OCD with age, however, being an anxiety disorder, it is a debilitating condition which may deteriorate with time. Therefore, if untreated, the symptoms may aggravate along with age. However, this does not imply that OCD at an older age would be more severe than what might occur at a younger age. The severity and degree of the condition solely depend on the duration of its existence. More the duration, worse is the condition.
Fortunately, OCD is a treatable condition, however, the recovery can take time. Therefore, it is essential to undergo an immediate medical diagnosis to check the presence of the mental disorder with the onset of its symptoms. Leaving the condition untreated not only impairs the regularities of life but also cause disruption in relations.

645,"Hello!
There are no straight answers to questions like these. The course of psychological disorders is always compounded by the patient’s demographics such as age, environmental conditions, physical health, etc. which all contribute to the prognosis of disorders.
OCD has been a disorder of interest in the psychological literature and accordingly, longitudinal studies have been taken up to follow its course. One of the most noteworthy studies was a 40 year follow up of more than a hundred cases of OCD. What was established through this study was that those who develop the disorder early in life, have a poor social support system and show symptoms that do not easily lend themselves to physical treatment such as magical thinking, are the ones who show a worsening of their disorder. Those who do not have such a background, show a stability in their disorder overtime. Other studies have shown that taking drugs and other treatments for the disorder do cause some symptom alleviation, but the disorder as a whole persists for life. Thus, its chronicity has been reaffirmed. The disorder can definitely be managed through treatment and prevented from worsening.",OCD
646,"The question should be “How worst is OCD”
It was within me since my childhood as i used to ask the same question multiple times until my mind accept it, it will be even 4 or 10 times.
But it continued for almost 22 years since my childhood to July'12.
Suddenly, In August’12, I was bringing a glass of water for someone, then after filling the glass, a thought strucked my mind that there is something wrong like dust particles is in the glass and compel me to throw the water and again fill it with fresh one. It started with 1–2 times but over the time became a compulsory act for me to throw and fill for even 10 times wasting 10–15 mins to drink water.
The second instance, was when i was driving my bike, suddenly my mind asked me to check “Whether you have run your bike over someone” . Then i return back at my arrival point and used to inspect roads to confirm the same multiple times.Due to this I used to take extra time to reach my destination. For example - If A distance of 5km take 15 mins then I was taking 1 hours.
Activities was increasing day by day and this was in every act, i was doing that , apart from i have mentioned here.
I used to wash hand multiple times after coming out of washroom as i feel that my hand still not cleaned and even it was harming my skin badly.
I used to waste half an hour in the washroom repeating the act multiple times.
When i watch movies then a single movie of 2 hours taking 4 hours to complete because there was compulsion by mind to replay some scenes multiple times.
In winter, I was bathing many times even at mid night as there was a feeling that my dody is not cleaned after watching bad objects, garbage,dead body etc.
Was Unable to sleep and used to wake up the whole night thinking what happened to me while crying.
I was not able to study and also my memory power was becoming weak.
In tension, my heart beat used to increased much faster and my body trembles.
I was fond of counting each and every things multiple times and placing them in order untill my mind accept that its ok.
I as sufferring from OCD since 2012 August and started my trearment in 2015 after rigorius struggle of 3 years and taking medicine from that time. I was on sleeping pills for two years. I am still undergoing my treatment and feel nuch better now. But one thing i regret is i am almost 5 years behind in my studies as my friends are employed now but not me. Our neighbour asks my parent, what is he doing in all these years, but you can answer to some but not to all.
My family member laughs at me and treat the symptoms of OCD as joke because there is very little awareness about mental illness in India as we know mental means mad.
It is not something that i can show , look i have fever, but only feel it within ourself.
Still, My family except my father belives that i had nothing because with them i was good.
That was just horrible experience and i used to weep. when i think about it in hindsight.
I give credit to “ CRIME PATROL OF SONY” as this serial gives an important message at the end that if anything you think is not going right then don't ignore it, consult a physciatrist.
I now know the reason why people suffering from depression suicides because their family dont accept that such thing even exists.
No one was with me , I myself consulted a physciatrist as i was living away from my parents .
The worst thing is that even well educated person are not ready to accept that such disease even exists and its upto you to control it
Even i tried a lot to not do the said activity but it was impossible for me as my mind had taken my control.
Please spread awareness about mental illness and don't ignore it.
I want to specifically mention that those who are suffering from anykind of mental illness can approach me,I have fought the dreaded battle which 99% succemmbed to. I will guide you in all possible way & want to be a part of your journey of recovery. I don't want to let anyone suffer what I had gone through,it was brutal, heartwreching deadliest,harmful more than one can ever imagine. I want to be a part of society to facilitate and educate everyone out there about mental illness.I have unimaginable will power,self motivation,never die attitude no matter what and the capability to never bow down to anything across the globe ( it helped me immensely )

647,"Unfortunately, yes, that is commonly what happens. For me personally, my OCD has gotten so much worse over the years. It’s truly debilitating to me now. I think back to even 4 or 5 years ago and it wasn’t this bad. I don’t know how to stop the downfall. I am on medications. They don’t seem to do a thing for my OCD. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel.",OCD
648,"Suhaib!
Yes and No.
If untreated, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can be the worst debilitating illness anyone can suffer. It does not improve with age and largely impacts an individuals’ interpersonal as well as academic/professional life in a negative way. Also it takes a very long time and significant amount of struggle for the individual to cope with their compulsions and incorporate them into their daily life.
If diagnosed and intervened early, individuals with OCD report that these compulsions are slowly weaning off with respect to time. However, obsessions are resistant to medication and can be managed with a combined psychotherapy.",OCD
649,"It is a disorder that waxes and wanes. Sometimes it’s better sometimes it’s worse. I would suggest that you go see a psychiatrist if you haven’t already and discuss treatment options. It can be treated now for a lot of people. Mine is so much better. I take Prozac 20mg 2xs a week on Tuesday and Thursday in the morning. You are supposed to take it everyday but I’m having swelling issues in my ankles and some SSRI antidepressants can cause this so I’m doing a experiment to see if lowering my Prozac dose helps with the issue. If it doesn’t work in about a month I might go back to my full dose. But it’s still controlling my symptoms so far so idk yet. But Prozac might not be the antidepressant that will work for you but it’s the first medication that the doctor will usually try out. But my OCD is so much better being treated than before.

650,"I'm 25 and my journey with OCD began in a tough place.
Growing up in a home where my dad struggled with alcohol and was often abusive, and my mom dealt with addiction, I felt alone as an only child. It was a lot for me to handle.
I started noticing signs of OCD when I was just 9 years old. I'd feel this overwhelming need for things to be just right, like counting or checking things repeatedly. My therapist thinks the trauma I went through back then might've triggered these behaviors. The chaos and uncertainty at home probably made me crave control, leading to OCD tendencies.
Therapy has been my lifeline (through ‘MantraCare’. Highly recommend it). It's helped me understand why I do these things and taught me better ways to cope.
Now, living on my own, I finally feel more stable and in charge of my life. It's been a tough road, but therapy has helped me manage and find peace.
If you're going through something similar, please know you're not alone. Seeking help can make a difference. Like it did for me.",OCD
651,"Thank you for your request.
I know this may sound rude, or off…but what causes stressful life events? Being alive. There are one billion and one endless things that can cause a stressful event. Even situations some wouldn't consider stressful, others do.
The events that lead to the development of OCD have been discussed by Sigmond Freud and some reject his theory, but I do not.
Freud suggested that OCD was caused by anal (no pun intended) parenting during the potty training phase of psychological development. What this means is that a parent who is overly harsh or obsessive themselves about intense cleanliness or uses shame during potty training is impressioning a mind that cannot understand to believe that ALL “messes” are unacceptable…accidental or not.
More recently it has become to be believed that many times the OCD is genetic. I can attest to this in my own family. Not only would it run deeply in the genetics, but it is environmentally reinforced by those in the environment that are already affected by the disorder (in my family). That is to say; an individual can carry the OCD gene and the environment is or can be what causes that gene to then express itself.
These “stressful life events” are what causes gene expression and are not, honestly, in my opinion well understood. To me, it seems like a correlation is not equal to causation situation, right now. Some we know to be true because we've seen it happen many times (such as what Freud theorized) and others with more rare diseases or cases it's a hypothesis. Again, I say that in my own opinion based on the current situation in neuropsychology. For example, in a twin study where only one family has children exposed to alcohol who then develop bipolar disorder? The individuals involved in the study may correlate alcohol as the causation of the bipolar disorder. Keep in mind I am not saying any of that is true. I am saying this is an example of how correlation, causation, and scientific facts work.
The one thing we know to be a fact is that certain events absolutely cause PTSD. We may know that disruption in the pr...

652,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

654,"It is thought that interpersonal trauma such as family violence, emotional abuse or neglect, sexual abuse or dysfunctional parenting styles (over protection, neglect, rejection) are associated with OCD.",OCD
655,A neurologist told me that my OCD was caused from losing my dad when I was young. (I remember thinking my entire life was gonna change as my dad was my brother and my world). A therapist extensively (4–6 hours) tested me that said my tests shown that I have OCD and ADHD. The therapist forwarded the written tests to my neurologist who diagnosed me with both.,OCD
656,"I have had quite severe OCD, the “pure O” type. That is no outward but mental compulsions.
It’s under control right now but it’s taken many months to recover from this bout. The first bout the medication and therapy didn’t do much. The second bout I self-administered therapy and started taking medication I had left from the first bought. Now I take it ongoing.
The symptoms are obsessions and compulsions. Obsession themes are various and compulsions in my case were things such as reassurance seeking, checking to see if I still had the obsession, and saying things to myself to try to neutralise the intrusive thoughts. Obsessions are basically what you’d think. They are like an inability to think of something else without the obsession being there in the background or foreground. It’s a bit like if I told you you had terminal cancer and only had a few months to live. All day you’d be thinking about death and dying and all about cancer. It’s a bit like that, except the obsession theme may be different and once you’ve dealt with the obsession logically or rationally it still remains. Sometimes you can get rid of an obsession using logic but only sometimes. I’d say to myself that I don’t believe, I don’t believe, I don’t believe what the obsession is telling me is true, it disappeared. Not long after another obsession would begin.
Anyway, what was it really like? What is it like now?
It has been absolute hell. I’ve had obsessions centred around 3 themes. Religious/existential, hypochondria, and sexual. I’ve had each theme to a devastating degree. Suicide often, just pure torture and suffering.
It affected my daily life at times to the point where I couldn’t really do anything, no socialising, no work, no study. I’d just sit there for hours going over my obsession. I’d usually only deal with one at a time.
I was drinking alcohol a lot. But this was only temporary relief. Once the effects would wear off, often I’d feel worse.
The reason why it can be so debilitating is because it can take over your whole being. All you can think about at times is your obsession. It can get really really terrible.
The treatment is exposure response prevention therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and medication — SSRIs.",OCD
657,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
658,"To understand how our mind works.. And body
For example ..Just now, if we listen the news that, war has begain with Pakistan..
BP.... BP will fluctuate automatically.. But in different different levels... Like if some mother whose child is deployed on border.. And a normal women..
Bp level will be difference.. But why?
Because our subconscious mind like memories system know the consequences of war..
Same.. Your consciousness depends on the memories... Every disorder related to subconscious mind.. Because it has duty to serve thoughts like a restaurant..
Your all cells of body depends on the consciousness feeling..
..evert disorders is fault in machine..
Already spirituality has been declared that..
You are “cheetana“and your body is “jadh “
Jadh means no feelings in this body.. Only your consciousness has power to feel..
So, Don't worry and try to understand spiritual language..lot of material is available.

My mom thinks that I'm doing all these because I dont want to eat no it is not like that .it is OCD which is ruining me
I'm scared what if bymistakely utter a negative thoughts
Wht if really happens?
If I do that ? if I dont?

What if i dont reply or dont deny it will it become real?
Or what if something really happens if i ignore or if i did not deny that thought. There are so many .I cant even explain this is rare cases in OCD
Some ppl thing they have OCD because of cleaneness, or arranging disorder but no
If you go and ask doctors they say it's a rare case which happens only with 0.2 or nearly 2%of people all over the world .

663,"I will tell you my story and I’ll leave you to judge if its one of the worst.
Until I was 14, I was very outgoing, sociable, friendly. Liked to hang out with friends.
Was my life perfect? No. It was good - most days were good and then some.
Then one day, the doubts began to niggle.
I don’t really know how to run a conversation. When I’m with this and this kid - we don’t have much to say to each other. I have to learn to be a better conversationalist.
How do I become a better conversationalist?
I can learn.
I watch kids. When they talk to each other. I pick up hints and cues.
But not in a way that you would think.
It works like this…
John: My sister gave this to me.
Dave: Oh, wow.
(Me in my head: ‘Say ‘Oh, wow’. When someone says something to you say ‘Oh, wow’.)
John: It’s a fidget spinner. Calms your nerves.
(After the person responds to comment, continue your own sentence. Don’t interject words like ‘Yeah’ before that. This way it’s balanced.)
For those of you who’re beginning to think I’m bonkers - I thought the same of myself. Well, read on.
Dave: How’s this supposed to calm your nerves?
(Ask question. Person says something ask a question. It has to be a question.)
The next time someone says something to me:
Sharon: I’ve got some homework to do.
(I scramble, furiously. My mind scrunches up, actively trying to come up with a question. I have to do it fast -)
Me: What kind of homework?
(Quick review in my mind: I’ve got some homework to do. What kind of homework?)
Sharon: Math.
(I’m supposed to ask a question, she stated something. I scramble furiously -)
Me: What kind of math?
(Quick review: I’ve got some homework to do. What kind of homework? Math. What kind of math? Duh. Wrong question. I should’ve asked something else.)
Sharon: (Looks at me oddly) Whatever…
My heart drops to my shoes. That was the wrong question to ask. I need to learn how to do this better.
And then:
If I could only converse naturally without all these rules I wouldn’t come across like such an idiot. But I can’t anymore because I forgot how.
The rules intensify, increase, and multiply by the hour. Every conversation brings about a new host of rules I must learn to follow.
I can never seem to get it right though.
Talking to other people becomes an emotional and mental nightmare for me.
Next up:
Sarah (addresses me & Ryan): My sister’s pregnant!
My ears perk up intently. I must know what Ryan will answer. I need to ask a question here because she stated something but let’s see if Ryan follows that rule -
Ryan: Congrats!!
My heart drops to my shoes. I got it wrong.
I used to love talking to people but now I hate it. I can’t participate in the conversation. I get on everyone’s nerves. It is mentally and emotionally excruciating. After I talk to someone I feel like I need to go to bed and sleep for a long, long time.
Can it get any worse? Yes. Oh, yes.
I have a savage reaction to the new reality I was suddenly thrust into. Yes, OCD came on me suddenly. It just fell out on me from the sky. It took over my life from one second to the next. I’m only 14 and I cry and cry and cry. I fight, fight, fight, determined to get it all perfect. Anger is quick to come - at myself and others for rejecting me. I lash out - at those nearest and dearest to me.
2 weeks go by and I realize the nightmare is now my life.
I must dig up some coping mechanisms.
Daydreaming. I daydream. Flee to an imaginary world where I’m my old, popular, sociable, beloved self. Doing everything I want to do with complete control over my life.
Maybe if something as simple as talking could get ruined, writing will also get ruined.
What?
Maybe the rules will come to haunt me when I write and I won’t be able to write anymore. Writing will become a living nightmare, like talking.
NO!
I love to write. Its my passion. I’m one of the best writers in my class. This can’t happen to me!
Well it can.
And the next time I take the pen into my hand…
Maybe the rules will take this over too.
I won’t allow the rules.
The rules will come anyway.
No! No rules! Go away!
Rule number one: First a short sentence and then a long one.
NOOOOOOO!!!! God, please NOOO!!
I’m not gonna let this happen to me. I fling my pen across the room and vow to never write again.
But I do. I try to fight with my demons, the rules, go away! And every time I retreat, in defeat.
If talking could get ruined, anything could get ruined.
Maybe I can’t read.
NO!
Rules. Read one word at a time. Don’t skip sentences -
NO! PLEASE GOD I CAN’T!! NO!
Reading makes me dizzy now.
Maybe I can’t see. Maybe I can’t hear. Maybe I can’t think.
Have you ever felt trapped, trapped in an inescapable nightmare?
I sob in sheer agony, unable to explain what’s eating me. Everyone will think I’m nuts. Really I am. No one can help me. No one can cure me. My mind is damaged. I must die. I want to live but I must die. I want my life to go back to the way it was before but it can’t because there’s no one in the world who’s mind does crazy things to them like mine.
I hope this gives you some insight in what some of the worst cases of OCD look like.
(P.S. After four years of unimaginable torment, I was finally diagnosed and now treated with medication. I take 400mg of Luvox a day.)",OCD
664,"Two that jump quickly to mind are TV star Howie Mandel, and soccer star David Beckham.
There are lots and lots of others (Google is your friend, here).
It’s unfortunately a fairly common disorder.",OCD
665,Howard Hughes.,OCD
666,"I have heard that the following celebrities suffer with OCD to some degree.
Howie Mandel, Charlize Theron, Leonardo DiCaprio, Howard Stern, and Cameron Diaz. I do not know how severe their individual cases are or what their particular obsessions and compulsions consist of.",OCD
667,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
668,"1 ) washing your hands again and again over.
2 ) crossing fingers every now and then, while seeing something specific which you think bring bad luck to you.
3 ) organise and rearranging things in order. An OCD get panics when they don't see things in organise pattern.
4 ) touching objects with specific number of time. For example : kissing ground 8 times before worshipping to god.
5 ) avoid crossing some paths, as you think it will bring any kind of curse to you.

669,"Hi,
Your question seems to be looking for an actual experience and it reminded me of a patient.
Patient was a male, 28yr old and was brought to the casualty with history of being disruptive. When i went to meet the patient i realized the he was blind in both eyes due to bilateral corneal scarring (and conjuctival hypertrophy). He was 6ft and 125kg, making it hard to restrain him when irritable.
History revealed that, since 10yrs, he had a compulsive urge to rub his eyes. He would rub it repeatedly to the point of pain and bleeding, and after a point developed corneal scarring. His urge was so distressing and the anxiety from trying to stop himself was too much, that he would continue despite the pain. He had undergone 3 corneal transplants in the past, all of which he damaged. The treatments drove his family to the brink of poverty. And currently due to excessive hypertrophy, he is no longer a candidate for another transplant. He was difficult to treat, never responded completely and we were looking for more of rehabilitation.

670,"Now see that is a great question! Not easy to answer, but I will try to the best of my ability. Personally, I have different forms of ocd anxiety. I have the organization one where my colors have to be in the right order or the desks have to be just right but if that doesn't happen, I just put my music on and tune it out. It doesn't always work but majority of the time it distracts my mind. This might be because I also have ADHD.
Now see with spelling, I am a spelling freak. If I know for a fact something is spelled wrong or I have that gut instinct, my brain will not leave me alone until I fix it or correct it. I've personally dealt with this by hanging out with people who have bad spelling skills so it's become easier over time.
And believe it or not, overthinking can be a form of ocd. Those what if situations that won't leave you alone until it finishes the story which could last for days, weeks, or even months on end and maybe repeat themselves? Yeah that's ocd. I personally again turn my music on to tune them out. Music has helped me so much in my life.

671,"OCD means you have fear of thoughts.
To overcome 100% , just understand below things and BOOM, you are free from OCD
No need to stop the negative thoughts.
The more you want to stop it, the more they will come.

So why to stop negative thoughts?!!
“Thoughts cannot do anything.”

676,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.

678,"OCD is the mind tricking itself.
OCD is participating in a war in which you are both enemies.
OCD is also referred to as ‘the doubting disease’. The intensity and depth of this doubt leads an individual to question even the most fundamental aspects of his/her life. This is why there are often Obsessions based around sexuality and the like. An individual is enslaved by their doubt to the extent that even an innate quality of the individual is in question.
If you suffer from OCD you know the difference between an ‘OCD thought’ and a normal thought. All obsessions are based on these lying thoughts and is clear evidence of the brain tricking itself.

679,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

680,"I have contamination ocd, religious ocd.
In contamination ocd, you will do one task multiple times, like you will wash your hands, you will clean the desk, you will wash your clothes multiple times, you will start doubting on simple things like if the door is closed or not and you will check the door repeatedly to ensure that Yes door is closed.
In contamination ocd you will feel uncontrollable desire to perform a task repeatedly. You will feel Anxiety whenever someone touch your phone, clothes or anything, if somebody touch your phone, one thought will trigger that his hands are not clean, he might have germs in his hands and he has touched your phone and now your phone is dirty, now because of this thought you will feel anxiety/fear and to reduce this anxiety what you will do is you will sanitize your phone, you will clean your phone, some people wash their phone also , I am also one of them who washed their phones.
In contamination ocd you will feel anxious after touching anything, any single thing because now you are thinking that your hands are not clean because you have touched the door . All you feel is anxiety anxiety and anxiety😰
In religious ocd, you will be noticing bad thought or very bad words about god. Like if you are doing prayer suddenly some bad thought will trigger in your mind related to God and then you will be feeling guilty that how can you think bad about God and then your ocd will tell you to say sorry to God immediately otherwise God wll not forgive you, now you will feel anxiety if you will not say sorry to God and because of your anxiety you will say sorry to God for the bad thought.
So this is related to religious ocd, which I described.
In any type of ocd you will feel anxiety and to reduce your anxiety you will do compulsions repeatedly.
I hope you will understand how you feel when you have ocd.

681,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is more than just being neat or overly cautious—it’s a mental health condition where intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) disrupt daily life.
🔹 Common Symptoms of OCD
OCD symptoms fall into two categories: Obsessions (unwanted thoughts) and Compulsions (repetitive behaviors).
🧠 Obsessions (Intrusive, Uncontrollable Thoughts)
People with OCD experience persistent, disturbing thoughts or fears that trigger anxiety. These might include:
✔ Fear of Contamination – Worrying about germs, dirt, or illnesses.
✔ Unwanted Violent or Disturbing Thoughts – Fear of harming others or oneself.
✔ Excessive Doubting – Constantly questioning if doors are locked, appliances are off, or things are done correctly.
✔ Perfectionism & Order – Feeling uneasy if things aren’t ""just right.""
✔ Religious or Moral Guilt – Fear of sinning or doing something immoral.
🔄 Compulsions (Repetitive Actions to Reduce Anxiety)
To manage obsessive fears, people with OCD engage in ritualistic behaviors like:
🔄 Excessive Cleaning & Handwashing – To avoid germs or contamination.
🔄 Checking & Rechecking – Doors, locks, appliances, or personal belongings.
🔄 Counting, Arranging, or Repeating Words – Feeling the need to perform actions a specific number of times.
🔄 Seeking Reassurance – Constantly asking if something is okay, even when already answered.
🔄 Avoidance Behaviors – Avoiding situations that trigger obsessive thoughts.
🔹 How OCD Affects Daily Life
OCD is not just about habits—it can significantly impact relationships, work, and emotional well-being. Here’s how:
💔 Loss of Time – Rituals and compulsions consume hours daily, making it hard to focus on tasks.
😞 Emotional Distress – Anxiety spikes when compulsions can’t be completed, leading to frustration and exhaustion.
🚪 Social Isolation – Some people avoid friends, family, or social gatherings due to their rituals or fears.
📉 Work & Productivity Issues – Constant checking or repeating behaviors can disrupt focus and efficiency.
💤 Poor Sleep & Mental Fatigue – Overthinking and compulsions make it hard to rest and recharge.
🌱 Can OCD Be Managed? Yes! Here’s How:
The good news? OCD is treatable with:
✔ Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) – Helps challenge obsessive thoughts & reduce compulsions.
✔ Exposure & Response Prevention (ERP) – Gradually exposes individuals to fears in a controlled way.
✔ Medication (if needed) – SSRIs (antidepressants) can help regulate intrusive thoughts.
✔ Mindfulness & Stress Management – Practices like meditation can help calm racing thoughts.
OCD can feel overwhelming, but with the right support and treatment, life can become much more manageable.

682,"I have had quite severe OCD, the “pure O” type. That is no outward but mental compulsions.
It’s under control right now but it’s taken many months to recover from this bout. The first bout the medication and therapy didn’t do much. The second bout I self-administered therapy and started taking medication I had left from the first bought. Now I take it ongoing.
The symptoms are obsessions and compulsions. Obsession themes are various and compulsions in my case were things such as reassurance seeking, checking to see if I still had the obsession, and saying things to myself to try to neutralise the intrusive thoughts. Obsessions are basically what you’d think. They are like an inability to think of something else without the obsession being there in the background or foreground. It’s a bit like if I told you you had terminal cancer and only had a few months to live. All day you’d be thinking about death and dying and all about cancer. It’s a bit like that, except the obsession theme may be different and once you’ve dealt with the obsession logically or rationally it still remains. Sometimes you can get rid of an obsession using logic but only sometimes. I’d say to myself that I don’t believe, I don’t believe, I don’t believe what the obsession is telling me is true, it disappeared. Not long after another obsession would begin.
Anyway, what was it really like? What is it like now?
It has been absolute hell. I’ve had obsessions centred around 3 themes. Religious/existential, hypochondria, and sexual. I’ve had each theme to a devastating degree. Suicide often, just pure torture and suffering.
It affected my daily life at times to the point where I couldn’t really do anything, no socialising, no work, no study. I’d just sit there for hours going over my obsession. I’d usually only deal with one at a time.
I was drinking alcohol a lot. But this was only temporary relief. Once the effects would wear off, often I’d feel worse.
The reason why it can be so debilitating is because it can take over your whole being. All you can think about at times is your obsession. It can get really really terrible.
The treatment is exposure response prevention therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and medication — SSRIs.",OCD
683,"Do you obsess about stupid things? Do you try, but can't turn your brain off?
There are 5 main OCD traits, and you only need one to make your life hell. 1.'washers'- afraid of contamination.Most hand-wash compulsively. 2.Hoarders- OCDs hoard because they think 'something' bad will happen if they throw something away (regular hoarders think everything is ultimately useful, so they're different). 3. checkers- you know the coffee's off, you checked it once. You check it again and unplug it. Wait- what if there's still electricity in it-better check! 4. arrange/count- may be superstitious about certain items or numbers, must have everything in order so nothing bad happens.5. Doubters and sinners-- these poeple feel if everything isn't done perfectly, something awful will happen.
You are trying to avert bad things from happening to you, loved ones, or just random people. I suffered from OCD for years. At my worst, I was sure that if I didn't stare at the fridge most of the day, it would explode and my children would be killed. The ceiling would fall. The car would catch fire. But I did get over it.
If you even think you have OCD go get evaluated. Because it is hell to live with, and you don't deserve that. You can have a good life>",OCD
684,OCD is an anxiety disorder. Its not a thought disorder. Although people with OCD are tormented by intrusive and unwanted thoughts its not the thought that is the problem. What happens is the anxiety producing part of thd brain is malfunctioning. It's mistakenly marrying up certain thoughts as a threat to your safety. The thoughts could be just about anything. The anxiety response to these thoughts compells the sufferer to try and solve the question of why they are having these these thoughts which leads to hours of daily ruminations. In an attempt to quell the anxiety and the need to solve why this id happening the sufferer will partake in all kinds if relief seeking rituals such as going to great lengths in avoiding anything that may trigger anxiety from these thoughts. They seek reassurances from others that they are okay and not insane. There are numerous ways they attemp to escape and find relief thought these ritualistic behaviors and rumination. Their goal is to rid themselves of these troubling thoughts however all these attempts to solve it backires with even more anxiety spiked or warnings that they are in some kind of danger. Because its an anxiety disorder all these attempts to seek safety or relief teach the anxiety producing part of their brain the amygdala that these thoughts are so important and unacceptable. It reinforces the amygdala that it is correct in sending out these anxiety spikes and the condition predictably worsens. Treatment for OCD is CBT therapy along with ERP which is Exposure anf response prevention. The therapy is designed to habituate the amygdala to the irrational fears by exposing it on purpose to the very thoughts that bother them so much. All attempts to quell the anxiety by ruminating or performing ritualistic behaviors are to be stopped. This turns the table on the OCD and teaches the amygdala that they are not in danger from these thoughts and in fact welcome them. Over time the amygdala will habituate to these thoughts and stop sending out spikes of anxiety from them. The thoughts them predictably recede. There are various OCD themes and subtypes but in the end they are all caused by an anxiety disorder and are all just bullshit that can be unwound with proper therapy.,OCD
685,"Unless you’re actively witnessing the compulsive actions, it’s not necessarily easy to spot. That’s because everyone has intrusive thoughts, but OCD people obsess over them and repeatedly try to do something to stop it from happening.
From personal experience though, most of my OCD fears were the worst when I was alone or when I was around people I trusted. Otherwise, I was too scared to let anyone see me go through it, so I would avoid events or distract myself when I couldn’t (like at work.)
If you’re trying to help someone recognize it in themselves, it’s only considered OCD when there are obsessive thoughts combined with compulsive actions (“rituals”). In a more technical sense, the picture below shows how it manifests. There are at least two parts of an OCD brain are hyperactive: the orbito-frontal cortex (responsible for decision-making and worry response) and the caudate nucleus (motor-planning).
Whether it’s a chemical imbalance or just the way that person’s brain is (currently) wired varies from person to person. But either way, the decision-making part of the brain in an OCD person is going haywire trying to determine if something is actually a threat and running through all scenarios that can happen. The motor-planning part is trying to do what it can to ensure the bad scenarios don’t happen. Hence the obsessive and racing thoughts + the ritual compulsions.
Luckily for those of us who have it, medication and therapy can help with the overactive parts of the brain and ultimately help manage — or even overcome — the disorder.
I hope that helps answer the question!",OCD
686,"I had OCD for years. I was calling people compulsively. I shopped every day for at least 10 years or more. I am now in debt at 25,000 dollars. I also had obsessions with food such as Doritos, and, caffeine. I sought treatment and, I overcame my obsessions at age 48 years of age. I wrote about OCD but my book flopped so I am writing another. I also took up other hobbies in life. I have become a skilled cook. I dealt with my obsessions with therapy but I also learned how to control them.
I had OCD bad and, most likely since my early teens but it took years to overcome it. I was unstable for close to 25 years or more. I had low self-esteem from the time I was 14 until age 48. I went through many jobs and, lots of rage for at least 35 years. I was or have been on 72 meds but I am on 2 now plus supplements that help keep my moods stable and, one controls my compulsions.",OCD
687,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects people differently, but usually causes a particular pattern of thoughts and behaviours.
They may try to ignore or stop their obsessions, but that only increases their distress and anxiety.
OCD symptoms can severely affect work or school, home life, and relationships.
Symptoms of OCD can include:
Fear of embryones or contamination.
Undesirable or taboo thoughts about topics like sex, religion, or violence.
Aggressive ideas toward others or yourself.
Extreme cleaning or handwashing, specifically among women with Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Ordering and arranging something in a particular, specific way.
Repeatedly checking on things, whether the door is locked or open.
Obsessive counting.
If your friend or family member may have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), try talking to them.",OCD
688,"A girl I dated had a mild form of OCD; Anything she saw out of place on the floor such as a spot or smudge would become a topic of conversation for her. If it was red, it was most likely ketchup but she would ""obsess"" over it and ask if it was blood or something malignant. Anything stained or discolored would invite her curiosity, to the point of her concluding it was something horrible.
At smaller restaurants with grease stains, she would assume it was anything but ""grease."" It was frustrating since no amount of logic or persuasion could convince her otherwise. After awhile, my strategy would be to use reverse psychology on her such as: ""yeah, I think that's mold, and pus"" but it would just induce her paranoia. Yes, horrible I know.
There were other behaviors like the fact she felt compelled to touch a glass several times before actually picking it up. Sometimes she'd grab it, set it down, pick it up, set it down, and finally sip from it. Left unchecked I think it could get quite bad, but I believe medicine management could remedy it - she just chose to live with it. Sometimes she'd pick up the phone and call a designated friend so they could verify that what she was looking (a speck, stain, dot, or discoloration) wasn't something awful - there was no way they would know, but they'd coax her into accepting it or thinking about something else.
Another way she would cope was to play insane amounts of video games. The OCD may have helped her master games like WoW, and Sims where she became engaged and was able to ""grind"" through lots of leveling up and upgrades...something I could never muster through. Also, those games would reduce her anxiety which in turn helped reduce the OCD symptoms.
I'm sure it's frustrating to have.",OCD
689,"One aspect of OCD is Checking.
Looking closely at things (sometimes taking photos for more lasting “proof”), or physically examining them.
Avoiding responsibility can mean escaping the anxiety around uncertainty. Getting someone else to be the last to leave the house or a room takes the responsibility for checking locks, stoves, faucets, etc. off of the person with OCD. If the concern is about making mistakes, then avoiding the opportunities to make mistakes, (e.g., not sending emails or having interactions with others), can reduce anxiety.
People with Checking OCD often seek reassurance. This reassurance can be from within, reminding oneself that they have done things correctly. It is also common to seek reassurance from others with questions such as “You saw me lock the door, right?” or “Does this mole look normal to you ? A lot of checking goes on inside the head. This can take the form of replaying events in one’s mind. For example, a person with Checking OCD can spend hours in bed going over and over conversations they had that day in order to be certain that they did not do anything hurtful or inappropriate. Safety concerns can result in “replaying the video” (in one’s head) of all of your actions before you left the house, in order to be certain that everything was done correctly.
OCD can have many symptoms due to an obsessive compulsion or rituals. Some individuals have hygiene obsessions, washing hands continuously, germ o phobia, or just in your thinking process. OCD with some individuals it’s harder to physically see.
Fear of contamination or dirt.
Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty.
Needing things orderly and symmetrical.
Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others.
Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects.
The best way to be sure is to be tested by a professional",OCD
690,"I am suffering from Obsessive Compulsive disorder (OCD). What should I do to control my repetitive behaviour?
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions and compulsions that intrude daily life and activities.
Intrusive thoughts, obsessive and compulsive behavior are some of the main symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive disorder. These symptoms are often debilitating, interfering in aspects of everyday life such as school, work, personal relationships and day-to-day tasks.
Obsessions include intrusive and persistent thoughts, ideas and images that evoke strong feelings of distress and worry. They are unwanted, uncontrollable thoughts that sometimes have taboo, sexual or catastrophic themes. Thoughts that are disturbing or odd do occur in most people, and they continue to go about their day without giving these thoughts significant attention. However, individuals with OCD experience and engage with these thoughts which can be severely debilitating and render them unable to move on from these thoughts.
Here are some examples of intrusive thoughts and thought patterns:
Disturbing aggressive thoughts such as murdering a loved one, such as a spouse, friend or child
Inappropriate sexual acts or sexual assault
Constant worry about infection from germs or environmental toxins
Intense fear that something catastrophic or fatal might happen to a loved one
Constantly wanting to reorder things till they feel ‘right’
The anxiety arising from these obsessions are managed by repetitive, ritualistic behaviour called compulsions.
An important distinction to be made between compulsions and habits is that they are and are time consuming and cause significant emotional distress, unlike habits. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours or rituals that need to be done to relieve anxiety. They are performed not for the pleasure of doing them but rather to relieve the distress and anxiety that arises from not doing it. Individuals living with OCD show significant difficulty in controlling their thoughts and actions, in spite of knowing that they are irrational or excessive. Here are some examples of compulsive behaviour:
Checking - behaviours that give reassurance that something is done correctly, and safety si ensured for themselves and their loved ones
Rituals - mental rituals such as counting in a specific way, repetition of ‘good’ phrases to counter something ‘bad’
Touretic / Tic related movements - physical movements such as tapping, counting things, physical movements that ‘just feel right’
Washing and cleaning repeatedly, sometimes a certain body part or in a certain manner with excessive amounts of soap or cleaning. It also involves excessive grooming and routines related to hygiene
Management and treatment of OCD is facilitated by mental health professionals such as clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, based on the treatment method chosen. Here are the prevalent treatment methods you can explore while living with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder:
Psychotherapy is effective in managing the frequency and severity of OCD symptoms. Therapeutic methods such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Exposure and Response Prevention Therapy help in managing the symptoms and their severity. These work on the thought patterns underlying compulsive behaviour as well as the responses to situations that call for compulsive behaviour. Psychotherapeutic services are offered by clinical psychologists who can effectively diagnose and chalk out treatment plans based on the prevalent symptoms.
Medication is an effective tool in managing the symptoms of OCD. Medication and psychotherapy often go hand in hand, one augmenting the other. Approaching a psychiatrist can help in diagnosis and required medication is prescribed based on the symptoms present.
Psychotherapy and medication are highly effective tools for managing the symptoms of OCD. In addition to seeking out professional psychological help, here are a few self- help strategies you can adopt to manage your symptoms on your own:
Practice self care strategies that will help you cope with anxiety and stress. Stress and anxiety can trigger repetitive behaviour, so engage in activities that reduce stress and help you feel calm and relaxed. It can be a hobby, relaxing forms of entertainment or anything you find pleasure in doing.
Healthy lifestyle choices such as adequate sleep, regular exercise has proven to be effective in managing symptoms of OCD. Having a healthy diet also makes it easier to manage the symptoms you experience.
Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, deep breathing are highly effective tools that you can add to your relaxation routine. They help you bring yourself back from a state of stress and anxiety.
Support groups are a great source of social support, which goes a long way in helping you manage your symptoms. Support groups facilitate a sense of belongingness, a safe space to speak about your experiences and provides an opportunity to speak to people who go through similar experiences as you do.
Going through a mental health concern can be difficult and tiring. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can be effectively managed with social support and professional psychological help.
Remember to take care of your mental health concerns as effectively as possible, and if you or anyone you know may be going through a mental health concern, kindly reach out for mental health support!",OCD
691,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
692,"The best way to treat OCD (Obsessive Compulsive disorder) is to try Exposure with Response prevention therapy. In this type of therapy a person is required to gradually expose themselves to their fear by not acting on their compulsions and sit with their distress till the time it subsides. Initially just after you expose yourself to the not performing a compulsion you will experience that your anxiety will surge up rapidly but you will just need to sit with it for sometime it will gradually decrease the anxiety after sometime. So the anxiety usually peaks then declines. Start with small things then increase it gradually. For example if you wash your hands 10 times just do it once and sit with the distress. Start with it for once a day then gradually increase the number of times you do it.
Another thing you can do is check your cognitions which means that when you get an intrusive thought check the validity of it. This can be difficult at first because thought-action fusion is a common component of OCD but if you keep doing it will be helpful. An example could be let’s say you have an intrusive thought that you have left the electric on in your house and it will burn your house down when you are out. Rate it on a scale of how likely this is to happen for example you think there is 85% chance of this happening. The question this thought and reframe it as ok what is the likelihood of electric kettle being left on and not burning the house and then think what is the likely hood of electric kettle not been left open. This can help manage the cognitive distortions present in the intrusive thoughts.",OCD
693,"Ten Things You Need To Know To Overcome OCD:
OCD is chronic.

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered, but at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life. The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it are really controls, and if you don't learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don't use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy, or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.
Two of OCD's main features are doubt and guilt.

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder. Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the ""doubting disease."" OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in. I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that that they will become murderers, etc. I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not. Doubt is one of OCD's more maddening qualities. It can override even the keenest intelligence. It is a doubt that cannot be quenched. It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others. Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there. Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it. The often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves
Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought.

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one's own real thoughts, but aren't. One of my patients used to refer to them as ""My synthetic thoughts."" They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit. As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will. Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, ""If you want to think about it less, think about it more."" Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions. Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape. Fears must be confronted. People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth that is, that their fears are unjustified, and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.
Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD.

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD. OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin. Ordinary talk therapy will therefore not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD. Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word ""Stop"" to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful. The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations, while resisting the performing of compulsions. The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth. I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in. Our goal is to wear the thought out. I tell them, ""You can't be bored and scared at the same time."" Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur. There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions. One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions. The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).
While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself.

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life's problems. While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time. Meds are not the 'perfect' treatment, however, they are a 'pretty good' treatment. Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result. Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug. They are the exception rather than the rule. People are always asking me, ""What is the best drug for OCD?"" My answer is, ""The one that works best for you."" I have a saying about meds ""Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody."" Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely upon meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them. Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse. This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control. Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state. Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety. While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful. One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them. Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You can't always fight your own brain chemistry unaided. Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are 'crazy.' People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.
You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well.

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around? My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD. As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life. Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.
The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist.

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively. As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you. Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do. This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.
You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD.

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on it will always lead you in the wrong direction. It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It's instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger, but since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give, fools people into relying upon them. While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn't true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.
Getting recovered takes time.

How long does it take? As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer. Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control. Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a person's ability to live. It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or done every day household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being 'partially recovered.' Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing, soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved. When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer. I ask them, ""Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?"" Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.
Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against.

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, ""Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent."" We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people. Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way. As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists. It gives them the tools to accomplish this. One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted. When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions. Another cause can be an individual believing that they were 'cured' and stopping their medication without telling anyone. Unfortunately, the brain doesn't repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state. Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on. In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

694,"If you have repeating OCD, you may feel like you are stuck in a never-ending loop of obsessions and compulsions. Here are some tips that may help you find relief.
1. Talk to a therapist.
If you're dealing with repeating OCD, talking to a therapist can be a helpful step. They can help you understand your thoughts and feelings, and work with you to find ways to cope. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective treatments for OCD. It can help you learn to recognize and manage your OCD thoughts and behaviors.
2. Practice exposure and response prevention.
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a type of therapy that can be helpful for treating OCD. This involves exposing yourself to the things you're afraid of, without engaging in the compulsions or rituals you typically do. This can help you learn to tolerate the anxiety and eventually reduce your fear.
3. Try medication.
If you're struggling with severe OCD, medication may be an option to consider. There are several types of medication that can be effective in treating OCD, so speak with your doctor to see if this is something that could help you.
4. Join a support group.
There are many online and in-person support groups available for people with OCD. This can be a great way to connect with others who understand what you're going through.
5. Make lifestyle changes.
Certain lifestyle changes can also be helpful for treating OCD. This might include things like getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.

You should consult to your psychiatrist, since he/she will prescribe medicines , accordingly, drugs take some time to act.
Usually therapy sessions needed in chronic ocd cases. So he might start those sessions timely along with medications.

696,"I don't suffer from OCD, although I have had a couple of friends who have worked with it and moved on. If I suspected that I had OCD, here's what I would do:
See a psychiatrist and pursue medical treatment for your symptoms. Prepare for the meeting by writing down your symptoms, concerns, and what relief would look like (i.e., how will you know when you're getting better, or how would you describe yourself before symptoms arrived)?
If you felt good about the psychiatrist, move forward with his or her treatment plan. However, if you had grave misgivings about your doctor, immediately make an appointment with another psychiatrist. I include this step because I've had some bad psychiatrists, ones with their own weird agendas, and I couldn't get away from them fast enough. Don't be afraid of this, though, as it was a small percentage of all the doctors I've seen.
Find a therapist. It is a combination of medication and talk therapy that relieves most mental illness. Your therapist can arm you with new ways of thinking that will protect you from your symptoms.
If you feel open around your therapist, continue going. If you feel frightened by your therapist or you don't trust him or her, pass on this particular person and try another. However, know that some anxiety is natural. Only move on if your therapist has lost your trust.
Keep going to both your doctor and therapist. Change can take time. You need to give the medicines a chance to build up in your system, and your new, healthier way of dealing with stress time to take hold and become habitual.
Some other things that can help:
Observe your thought processes. Don't judge, just watch and remember.
Keep a journal. Try keeping an objective record of how you are dealing with unwanted thoughts and behaviors.
Write a friend about it. It can help to have someone else's ear. You may not get to the bottom of the problem, but you can make some important discoveries if you get your theories out in the open to see.
Try to loosen up the grip of your emotions on your mind. If you're feeling in danger, it's going to be difficult to make real change. Try techniques like slowing your breathing and becoming hyper-aware of your senses.
Related to the last one, also try to bring your focus away from your mind and its rules to the outside world. What's in the room or space you're in? How does it sound, how does it smell? Sometimes exposing yourself to something that's overwhelming to your senses can cement your focus on the outside world, such as smelling lemon juice or feeling something soft under your hands, like a pillow.
You can try alternative therapies, like acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, or Alexander Technique. I've had psychological relief from certain sessions of these, but my diagnosis is different than yours, so results may vary.
Jump start your happiness. What makes you laugh? What show is your guilty pleasure? What movie have you seen more than any other (careful here--make sure it's a positive one)? Indulge in a great meal, or make time for a walk outside today.
I hope you find the answers you need soon. By the way, most of the psychiatrists and therapists I've seen have had a sliding scale for people who didn't have the money to see them. Don't suffer when you could be getting help. Good luck.",OCD
697,"Although I can't substitute medical advice, I would say that your symptoms most definitely meet the criteria of obsessive compulsive disorder. OCD consists of irrational and/or repetitive thoughts and compulsions which you must complete to relieve the obsession.
While giving in to these compulsions may relieve your OCD temporarily, in the long run it only reinforces it and makes it worse. If you do not want treatment, the only advice I can give you is ignoring it. It may be difficult at first, but you can do it. Think of how irrational it is. Research germs. Understand that you can't get sick that easily. You have to confront it. No matter how bad your compulsions get, DON'T FEED INTO THEM! Rationality is your friend.
Just confront the OCD and stay strong and rational. OCD thrives on irrationality.",OCD
698,"Shivaji, violence and war have little to do with aggressive behavior they are evoking.
There must some food you are consuming probably having too much preservative, canned food. After the heavy and mostly cloudy monsoon and now a foggy winter this year you may have grown deficient with Vitamin D3 (lack of sunlight) which may have further aggravated your mental health. Which also leads you aggressive and irritability initially on depleting levels. Having too much synthetic sugar, excessive meat, heavy protein diet, too much caffeine, excessive alcohol, excessive smoking leads to irritability and aggressive behaviors too. Some times the stomach flora and fauna may get destroyed and regenerates due to infections which causes the same.
Check you are in a room which has sufficient sunlight and well ventilated.
Get your Na and Mg salt levels checked. Try avoid high energy or heavy food post sunset. Do you sleep well? Inappropriate and bad food also lead to irritability and aggressive behaviors.
OCD unlike common cold which you contract with single violation, it develops over a period of time.
I think you should dissociate your current quest of knowing (any subject) with OCD. OCD wont let you focus for long or permit you so much freedom reading so much.
It gets pretty much mad when OCD strikes specially during winters.
OCD is ego-dystonic to you will very much know when it strikes.
Pass these little fixes and in case its more overwhelming don’t hesitate to visit your doctor who is able to prescribe mild anti-depressants. If he fails to rectify he may refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist accordingly.

701,"In the olden days, when one had to pay for pictures, children admired themselves in the mirror as they learned to love themselves. As they developed a healthy appreciation for themselves, they would spend hours admiring their reflection leaving many clamoring, begging, pleading and beating at the bathroom door, or going outside as they couldn’t get in. Everyone tolerated it as it was considered a normal part of healthy development!
Now days, instead of developing a sense of love for self through the mirror as children used to do, they leave the bathroom free for others to use as they can immortalize themselves through digital imagery. This is a normal and healthy part of development, which once was accepted as healthy development, but is now demonized because now it’s considered healthy and responsible to hate yourself especially if you’re white.
So, during this period of history in which it’s PC to hate self resulting in Suicide Rates of Epidemic Proportion, it’s considered good to learn to hate and abuse ourselves while learning to love those who abuse us.
But I’m sure you would like something other than a daughter who learns to hate herself and thus becomes a suicide risk like so many of today’s young people?
If you do, please be assured that once your daughter develops a healthy sense of self-esteem, she won’t be so interested in looking at herself, or capturing her image, as she’ll then be able to nurture other aspects of herself in a more adult way. Until then, be glad you can use the bathroom when you need to.
If you want to know what narcissism truly is, have a look at this video library:
If you check into this, you’ll understand that narcissism is not learning to love yourself, but an inability to love yourself at all. You might even find elements of character of the ones who are trying to convince you something is wrong with your daughter as she learns to love and appreciate herself.
Not to worry, if you leave your daughter alone, she will develop in all possible ways unhindered. Like everyone else, she’ll develop those aspects of self one at a time as that is what the brain allows us to do.
As different areas of the brain develops, our personal development follows!
When the brain is fully developed at the standard age of 24, or thereabouts, if her primary focus is still taking thousands of pictures of everything she does, then I would consider counseling and family counseling to help her move on to the next phase of development so that her emotional maturity will equal that of her brain capacity.
Not to worry, most people never do this work. Now you know why you’re concerned as you’re listening to someone who hasn’t!
If you’re concerned about her development now not being up to par with a 30-year-old, you might want to seek professional help sooner rather than later! Nothing like a bit of comfort to relieve us of needless stress.
The good news is, while your daughter develops in a healthy way, the narcissists, socio and psychopaths will have plenty to bi*ch about! At least everyone will happy except your daughter who will be needlessly shamed as she learns to properly hate and despise herself to the satisfaction of others.
Note: my apologies to anyone who is intentionally offended.",OCD

They project these negative emotions into and onto others and the cycle repeats itself.

Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.
Narcissism is about Image Worship.
You worship images of the narcissist that you have in your mind. Cinematographic sequences, quite literally copied from movies. Those pictures mean so much to you that you are willing to undergo abuse to get them.
That’s the transaction, the narcissist gives you loving images (but not actual love), and you stick around to be abused.
That’s the deal
like it or not
that’s the deal!
No matter what you do, no matter how you approach the narcissist, if you’re looking for loving images, you will get abused.
That’s the deal!
Your love of these images encourages the narcissist. Not Facebook, or selfies they take - narcissists need someone to abuse! They need a portable latrine! They cannot deal with their own shit!
You have selfies of the narcissist that haunt you, that you worship. They are selfies you took of the narcissist (they make you do everything). You took them with your eyes, and they meant more to you than anything on earth, or in the heavens.
By worshiping images you broke the Law of God,
you encouraged the narcissist

707,"First of all, it's important to know that narcissism exists on a spectrum. Someone could be low in the number of traits they possess, or high. We all have SOME narcissistic traits. That said…
Look out for lying. Lying when it's not even necessary.
Lack of empathy. Not able to put themselves in someone else's shoes.
Supremely selfish. It's all about them, with no consideration for others.
Manipulation. But this can be very subtle, so you really have to keep your eyes and ears open.
Causing friction between people. Divide and rule.
Turbulent relationships. She may have relationships that don't last long.
Problems with money. They often spend, spend, spend, and are potentially unable to pay accounts.
They need validation. They need to hear how wonderful/pretty/awesome they are.
They play the victim, can fake illnesses, anything to get attention.
They may change jobs a lot, or possibly not even work if they can help it. If they have a partner to support them financially, that would be ideal.
They're chronically bored.
There may be an addiction of some sort, but not necessarily.
Depression and anxiety are a possibility.

708,"Lying. About anything. Where it offers no useful purpose for the liar even. When caught in lie either changes subject or will hold on to that lie forever. (Hello parents!!)
Either doesn’t ask how you are or asks but moves in before you answer
Never asks about past trouble/events that happened to you. Even tiny things. Example. You get new glasses. No asking how you like them, adjusting to them etc etc Big things too. Example. Your dog dies. No asking next day, next week or ever how you are feeling. The real “How are you?”",OCD
709,"I will answer from the idea that you do believe she is exhibiting these traits — and I wish for you to really communicate with her to identify what she really wants. Sometimes when needs are unmet for a person then they might adapt in ways that have these tendencies, although the person might not qualify for a diagnosis. You see, in difficult life circumstances then it’s a natural human instinct to develop some traits in order to have survival. And when dangers pass and things are calm again then to have it subside. If these changes happen then it is not a personality disorder at all. By definition a personality disorder is something which is persistent through time.
In terms of wondering about your own blame — if you are able to connect with her on some emotional level then perhaps you could ask her, and hopefully that could be a precious interchange. To be vulnerable with others, including your partner of your children, allows for them generally to take down barriers as well.

711,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

712,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
713,Personally my primary concern is if the diagnosis came from tik tok or a real doctor,OCD
714,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",OCD
715,"Hello, thank you for the answer request
For basic understanding of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder you need to check for patterns that can be indicative of OCD such as:-
Excessive hoarding
Excessive cleaning
Checking and rechecking
Being stuck with order and symmetry.
Repeating an action in number of 3 (such as washing face or blinking 3 times)
Perform seemingly nonsensical behaviour
Self doubting or doubting others due to false memory, etc.
Having said that one needs to understand that symptoms do not make a disorder, dysfunctionality does. So you can be highly organised or hold on to invaluable things but it doesn't necessarily equate to being OCD.
OCD is an anxiety based disorder and a key characteristic of it is the OCD cycle, which is:-
Obsessive thoughts: stress provoking and unwanted thoughts, urges and mental images. It may also include doubtful thought or false memories.
Anxiety: it's a false alarm that leads to the need to carry out a compulsion. It can be manisfested in form of worry, fear, distress or disgust.
Compulsion: any unwanted behaviour that is carried out to get relief from anxiety.
Relief: temporary relief ; it is short lived as obsessions come back after a while.
There are various behavioural therapies that can help in breaking this vicious cycle. If you think you have OCD visit a mental health professional now.",OCD
716,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
717,"Difficulties in my Life
OCD
Loss of pets
Natural disaster destroying all that I know in 24 hours and causing me to relocate unexpectedly as a child
Loss of many people who were very close to me (incl. my grandparents who helped raise me)
Witnessing people pass away and struggle with fatal disorders
Being called fat constantly
Eating as a way of suppressing the pain
Being bullied throughout school and feeling suicidal
Feeling scared that people would judge me, and not wanting to take my medications
Fear that I would lose control of my mind and wind up in a hospital
Neverending guilt for my past mistakes
Finding comfort in my Faith, Christianity, but having my ocd attack this after being told that certain doctrines were incorrect
Fear of failing; perfectionism
severe depression
Out of this, I can say the most difficult thing in my life is OCD. You see, everyone can draft a list like this, but only some fight with their mind while doing so. One of the things I learned to help with depression is that for every “bad” we list there are many more “good” events. Having someone else make a list of good things with me was very healing.
Yes, OCD is a significant concern to me. My faith is still a rock in my life. However, I yearn for the day to be normal, to wake up without intrusive thoughts. Would it change my life? Completely. I do not know if there would be a greater relief besides my Salvation.
As for the question of genetics, Im not sure. One of my parents had it, but I know that there are others without genetics. It had to start somewhere, right?
If anyone else on here is struggling, you are not alone. We can talk anytime.",OCD
718,"This is drastically different from person to person as mental illnesses tend to be, but I can share my experience.
(My) Signs:
I find myself getting very upset over thoughts or imaginings I have that dont feel like they came from my own opinions and beliefs more often.
I feel my focus shift from ‘I'm doing this and the compulsion is a pesky inconvenience’ to ‘I'm doing my compulsion and the fact that I'm supposed to be doing something else is a pesky inconvenience’.
I cant step away from anything that I'm working on because it's never ‘good enough’. I never feel finished with it
I get 3–4 new compulsions in a short span of time
When my tourettes gets worse
Compulsive thoughts pop into my head more than usual
What I do:
Challenge the compulsions/dont give in to them
Talk to my therapist
Reason through other thoughts related to OCD
Make extra effort to take care of my mind and body",OCD
719,"I have had quite severe OCD, the “pure O” type. That is no outward but mental compulsions.
It’s under control right now but it’s taken many months to recover from this bout. The first bout the medication and therapy didn’t do much. The second bout I self-administered therapy and started taking medication I had left from the first bought. Now I take it ongoing.
The symptoms are obsessions and compulsions. Obsession themes are various and compulsions in my case were things such as reassurance seeking, checking to see if I still had the obsession, and saying things to myself to try to neutralise the intrusive thoughts. Obsessions are basically what you’d think. They are like an inability to think of something else without the obsession being there in the background or foreground. It’s a bit like if I told you you had terminal cancer and only had a few months to live. All day you’d be thinking about death and dying and all about cancer. It’s a bit like that, except the obsession theme may be different and once you’ve dealt with the obsession logically or rationally it still remains. Sometimes you can get rid of an obsession using logic but only sometimes. I’d say to myself that I don’t believe, I don’t believe, I don’t believe what the obsession is telling me is true, it disappeared. Not long after another obsession would begin.
Anyway, what was it really like? What is it like now?
It has been absolute hell. I’ve had obsessions centred around 3 themes. Religious/existential, hypochondria, and sexual. I’ve had each theme to a devastating degree. Suicide often, just pure torture and suffering.
It affected my daily life at times to the point where I couldn’t really do anything, no socialising, no work, no study. I’d just sit there for hours going over my obsession. I’d usually only deal with one at a time.
I was drinking alcohol a lot. But this was only temporary relief. Once the effects would wear off, often I’d feel worse.
The reason why it can be so debilitating is because it can take over your whole being. All you can think about at times is your obsession. It can get really really terrible.
The treatment is exposure response prevention therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and medication — SSRIs.",OCD
720,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a complex mental health condition that is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Some of the specific causes of OCD include:
Genetics: Studies suggest that OCD may run in families, and certain genetic mutations have been linked to an increased risk of developing the condition.
Brain structure and function: Abnormalities in specific regions of the brain and imbalances in certain neurotransmitters have been associated with OCD.
Environmental factors: Trauma, stress, and life events can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms.
Cognitive factors: Certain patterns of thought and problem-solving strategies may contribute to the development of OCD.
It's important to note that the exact cause of OCD is still not fully understood and may vary from person to person. However, current research suggests that a combination of these factors likely plays a role in the development of the disorder.",OCD
721,"The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a result of a combination of factors, including:
Brain structure and function: Brain imaging studies have shown that certain regions of the brain are hyperactive in people with OCD, which may be involved in the development of intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.
Genetics: There is evidence to suggest that OCD may have a genetic component, as the disorder tends to run in families.
Environmental factors: Trauma, stress, and life changes can trigger or worsen symptoms of OCD in some individuals.
Neurotransmitters: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, may play a role in the development of OCD.
Cognitive and behavioral factors: Cognitive biases and maladaptive behaviors may also contribute to the development and maintenance of OCD symptoms.
It's important to note that while these factors can play a role in the development of OCD, they do not necessarily cause the disorder in all individuals. Further research is needed to fully understand the underlying causes of OCD.
Regardless of the causes, treatment for OCD is typically a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-help strategies, and can be very effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.",OCD
722,"The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not fully understood, but a combination of genetic, neurological, behavioral, cognitive, and environmental factors is believed to play a role. Imbalances in brain chemicals called neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, may contribute to OCD symptoms. Family history of the disorder, stressful life events, and personality traits such as perfectionism and high anxiety can also increase the risk of developing OCD.
Strictly Upvote aim 150 for research",OCD
723,"For me, it is being over sensitive towards certain things and my fears are the reason. OCD is just not bout washing hands, it is much more than that but it can be helped with treatment and right approach. Never loose hope.",OCD
724,YESSSSS and yes and yes. It is the the “C” part of OCD. It is very very common. It can appear as self positive talk but it is really just trying to prevent or rationalize intrusive thoughts. It sometimes does work by making it impossible to think of the thing that you are trying not to think about but it generally adds to the anxiety rather than calm it. There is positive self talk that you can also indulge in but it has to be not when you are dealing with triggers or intrusive thoughts. The key is to not indulge the intrusive thoughts. It kind of validates and encourages them if you do. So if you talk to your self be mindful of that. Always use positive and self affirming words and do not indulge your anxiety or rationalize it or give it attention it doesn’t deserve. It will only feed it and make things worse. I have had OCD for a very long time and I am pretty comfortable with it and accept it is a part of me. But I still struggle. People love to say they are obsessed and that they have OCD ato indicate that they like things neat and tidy. They just have no clue on how hard it is to manage it on a daily basis. It is exhausting. A lot of people think that intrusive thoughts indicate that you are bad or because you “imagine” and then worry it might happen and all the endless alternatives that go along with it. It is just not the case. For example. You may worry that you are going to run someone over with the car. You are worried you will not be able to prevent it. You start thinking of what possible outcomes would be if you did hit a person with your car. How you would feel how you would react. Who would you call. The damage to your car. If you could have avoided the person. If you hit the person on purpose. Maybe you didn’t but what if they thought you did? Could you get away with it without getting in trouble. Should you try to do life saving measures. Do you have a first aid kit in your car? Would a person you hit with your car even be alive? What about damage to your car? Would it be drivable or would you be without a car? How would you deal with this? Why are you thinking things like this when a person is probably dying on the ground. So while this is happening say you are driving. You are going somewhere unfamiliar and you are having trouble with gps and trying to focus on the exit and the weather and whatever else. But you can’t. So you start talking to yourself trying to override the obsessive thoughts and you go over the directions and things you are currently doing or trying to do in real life but you then start repeating it and worrying about the possible out comes of that. Do I have enough gas? Will I find the right exit? I always get lost. What if I take the exit too fast because I almost missed it. Blah blah blah. You are doing the same thing out loud. That you are doing in your head and overthinking trying not to over think. Does that make sense? It is the best example I can think of off the top of my head without letting myself over think too much! My best advice is to be gentle with yourself!,OCD
725,"Talking to yourself is not necessarily a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, it can be a symptom of OCD if it is accompanied by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that cause you to perform repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions. OCD is a mental health disorder that affects people of all ages and occurs when a person gets caught in a cycle of obsessions and compulsions. If you are experiencing symptoms of OCD, it is important to seek help from a mental health professional. OCD counseling online is available through TalktoAngel, which provides a safe and confidential space for individuals to discuss their experiences and get support. A mental health professional can help diagnose and treat OCD using a combination of therapy, self-help techniques, and medication.",OCD
726,"I talk to myself. But not myself exactly.
When ever I talk to myself, I am not talking to anyone. But actually, I am talking to someone.
Its difficult to explain.
No I am not talking to an imaginary person, not really. I am talking to someone I know, a real life person. I just picture them when I talk to myself.
When i talk to myself, I am usually telling someone what I want to say to them. Its basically saying what I want to say to them without saying them.
It also depends on who I am picturing, if its a close friend, things get personal. If its a crush, its just things i find interesting. If its a person I really dislike, I would probably be telling them why i don't like them. Sometimes, when I talk to myself I learn more about myself in the process.
I never give myself mental notes, or say things to keep track. I just have things to say, things that I want to say but I am too scared to. I guess its a way of dealing with stress? I don't know.
My sister says she talks to herself, but she actually responds to what she says.
My other sister just says one word or so, to keep a mental note. Like it would be silent, and she would just say “Chicken nuggets” out of now where.
I assure you, we are not crazy. Everyone talks to themselves. It's different for everyone. Because everyone thinks differently. Like how everyone does mental math differently.",OCD
727,"Short answer is no nothing is wrong with you.
Many people talk to themselves like that even I do, psychologist say it is a sign of intelligence that your mind is able to do things much quicker than normal people. No doubt you also talk faster than anyone you know.
Talking to oneself is also a great way to make intense situations less complicated because you are able to hear your own calculations of what to do next. I do it at work all the time and people ask me why I do it, why? Because it helps me complete things quicker rather if I just sat and completed it in my head.
You could also be needing someone to just chat to aswell I get lonely sometimes and find myself asking myself questions mainly because I notice well no one is around so who's their to say I'm weird or crazy?.
Or You are just simply filling in social voids, in other words it's the brains way of saving yourself from loneliness.
You might even do it because there aren't any other intelligent people to talk to and who better to understand your own thinking than yourself.
Don't stop doing it because you think something is wrong with you because nothing is wrong with you unless you have been taking some trippy mind warping drugs then nothing is wrong, especially that you have noticed it and are able to question it that just proves more that you are healthy and mentally stable.
Anyway Those are some possible reasons you might talk to yourself.",OCD
728,"I am writing anonymously, because I do this as well.
There is nothing “wrong” with me. I believe I haven’t been very social, my social life has suffered the past few years and I find myself doing this, creating scenarios of past experiences or talking to myself about things…the way things could have gone. When I realize what I am doing, I stop and am very surprised. I too, have gotten very emotional because it feels very real.
Do you have a social life? I ask this, because often when people are alone, for too long, they can begin talking to themselves. Humans are social animals, we are not meant to be alone.
Now, when I am “talking to myself” or creating these scenarios, I am NOT responding to myself. I don’t real conversations with myself. It is more of me talking out about how something should have gone or I am replaying arguments and am saying my part out loud while I replay what the other person is “saying” in my head.
These kinds of things happen when we are too much in our heads and we have to get things out. It’s like processing information and experiences out loud.
If it bothers you, I would ask you to think about what you are feeling, thinking about when you begin to do this? Are you alone? Are you stressed out? What are you experiencing with that you are not dealing with?
I hope this helps.",OCD

732,"It depends totally upon you. What does “Normal” means to you? I talk to myself all the time. I feel like its completely normal and most of us do it.
I usually talk to myself when I am feeling low. It helps me.
Is this only me or someone else also feel this way that when I talk to myself, usually thinking about my problems, I give myself the best advice. It surprises me sometimes. It feels as if there is someone inside your mind who cares for you the most. It’s that subconscious mind which amazes me all the time.
I think we all have a box of ideas and thoughts, which we lock away deep in the mind, and open it when we need it the most.
How amazing would It be if we had complete possession of that box? Do we even realize how many stupid shit we do all the time?
Actually, we do realize when that box opens.
Coming back to your question, I genuinely feel that It is completely normal.
I used to do it all the time. I wanted to write a book at some point of time. So, I used to listen to loud music and walk and walk and walk until my leg started burning. I used to make up stories about everything. This is something I even do now. I would suggest, try it. You will love it.
But, there is some downsides to it or at least in my case there was.
You will start enjoying yourself. You can be happy alone , which can make you kind of anti-social.

734,"My Ex Narc was an ANAL PERFECTIONIST. NOTHING was allowed to be out of place ever. 7 days a week I endured the bull shit of him going through the house and CORRECTING everything that was out of place in his delusional imagination from the curtains being too far to the left or the right, the furniture in every room was always 1/8th of an inch out to him and he would loose his shit over it too. He would always boot the girls off the living room couch just so he could move it nothing more than 1/8th of an inch. It was hell every night he came home from work. I dreaded hearing that truck come up the drive way. In a split second of hearing that truck my brain went into overdrive with thoughts of is this out of place is that out of place. Are there fingerprints on the glass doors, are the girls bedrooms tidy. OMG it was psychological torcher. When our youngest daughter was still needing my assistance with eating the older one would set the table and we three would sit together and eat he wouldn’t think twice about rearranging the table to his liking not thinking one bit about how it was affecting the daughter who set the table in the first place. Another thing he did each time he sat down with us even though he never ate with us(He would eat on the couch watching t.v)he would insist that both girls have a beer and sometimes two because it was his time with them. Now theses girls were toddlers but he insisted they drink beer with him and of cause the obvious happened they never ate their dinner and that was my problem I gave them to much LOL. Some nights if I was still preparing the meal he wouldn’t think twice about washing the kitchen floor right under my feet while I’m still doing things. OMG . If he could smell food in the house when he came home EVERY window In the house was opened up and it didn’t matter if it was the dead of winter with a blizzard going on outside those windows had to be opened. The absolute wackiest part about all this was he had to be naked when he did it and he sure did like prancing around naked .",OCD
735,"One winter’s cold, tortential rainy night at 22:00, NPD mother, frail and lame knocked one of her many pens on the floor off her side table next to where she sat. This pen rolled under her chair, she couldn't retrieve it, she phoned me asking me to walk over and retrieve this pen. “No mum I'm not coming out in this weather, you have other pens there exactly the same, I'll do it tomorrow”.
About 20 mins later a friend of mine phoned me to say that my mother had phoned her to ask if she would walk to her and retrieve this pen, she also told her no, it's late, cold and torrential rain.
Another 20 mins later my daughter phoned me upset crying, “Grandma wants me to walk over to retrieve her pen from under her chair and she's really angry at me because I said no, the weather is too bad, I don't know what to do as she keeps phoning me and accusing me of being ungrateful and not caring about her”.
I told my daughter to turn her phone on silent which she did. I then had a call from mother disgusted with me and her granddaughter for not going out to get this damned pen, how dreadful her family were that no one cared enough about her to go help her blah blah.
“Mum use one of your other pens it won't make any difference”. Mother replied “I'm not using a pen but I want to go to bed soon and I need that pen back on the table where it belongs, I won't be able to sleep knowing that pen is under my chair, I've tried to move the chair but it's way too heavy for me”
No one went out on that cold winter's night in torrential rain, I sat in my warm dry house chuckling at the thought of her laying in bed tossing and turning, unable to sleep because of a solitary biro pen haunting her as it lay under her chair, it must have been calling to her “hey don't forget about me, ha ha, I'm still here, I'm still under your chair, ha ha ha ha”",OCD
736,"You get a self righteous dog walker. He walks the families dogs with an agenda to fill the time slot allotted to “time to walk the dogs”. This time is spent leashing up the pets who struggle with him as they do not wish to be “walked”. They cower and struggle until the leash has been properly placed. He steps purposely out the door with both Scotties in tow. He is towing them. The walk is intended for a chance to relieve themselves. In realizing the intention, the dogs challenge the length of the lease as they are pulled along with the purpose of reaching the vacant lot at the end of the street designated for the purpose. They are not allowed to walk on sidewalks as other neighboring pet owners may interfere with the process and success of reaching the lot in a manner that does not include any socializing or curiousity. They walk straight down the middle of the street on a mission to reach the lot. On occasion, they may not be able to hold their evacuation and are forced to relieve themselves in the middle of the street as they are walking. Another reason for the street walking. The owner does not feel it necessary to pick up pelted poop in the middle of the street as that is not private property. So, while the original intention is to avoid confronting another animal on their walk, the bonus result is not having to be accountable in picking up poop. It is an uneasy thing to watch when the dogs are forced to poop on the run ,so to speak -in this manner.
At some point, he crosses the sidewalk from the street and enters the lot. The dogs are given a relaxed length on the lease for the intended relief. He never talks to the scotties or watches them for any purpose other than peeing and pooping in the lot. The meeker of the two dogs quickly relieves herself here and produces poop, maybe even pees. The other one having pooped in the street already is simply focused on returning home. She’s predominately a stubborn dog and her stubborn behavior mirrors her owner. I’ve watched this ritual many times. I watch him use the plastic newspaper covers he must accumulate to pick up the meek one’s poop. He gathers it in and seals it with a knot. He then yanks each dog facing home and uses the sidewalk on his return trip. There is a purpose for usage of the sidewalk now. He passes a row of dense trees in between two homes near the corner lot. There he tosses the poop bag he’s so carefully been accountable at using for the excrement. He always looks both ways before tossing it deliberately into the trees. There it is joined by the residual poop bags of days prior. No one is the wiser. So he thinks.
Upon turning the dogs towards home on the sidewalk they are not allowed to stop and smell or enjoy the walk in any way. The intended mission complete, the narcissist with OCD has checked off his duty on the checklist in his brain regardless of the method lacking in both accountability and intention of a walk beyond necessary methodology. If he passes me, he does not realize nor does he care that I may have noticed his littering and obvious callous regard for his pets. His arrogance can be felt in a manner that extinguishes words.
The stubborn dog is in the lead ahead by ten paces as the leash allows and is now towing his cruel, selfish owner. The meek dog is striding happily alongside of his owner as she is under his control and has submissively long since accepted this role. If she stops, even briefly, to catch a scent she is choked back in line. By the time they reach their door and get inside, they are eager for return to their cages. This is their life. Cage in, cage out. A prop used to beg the honorable intentions of the dog owner. He then adjusts the fringe of the entry rug that they disturbed on their way to the cages that embody all they know about having a home. Sometimes the meeker of the two, or the stubborn one who only got to poop on the run, urinate in their cage as they didn’t have time to accomplish the mission on the walk. They are deeply admonished, the entire room, along with the cage is sanitized.
The dog’s purpose is a prop for establishing what a good guy he is. He is a reluctant dog owner, at best, and does his duty to satisfy his wife’s desire to own dogs. If you must own dogs, he thinks, do so with purpose. He is the alpha male, after all - he reasons.
While he was walking the dogs his wife was busy making dinner. They meet at the table and eat methodically while small talking. After dinner there is a helpful hand from him as he brings the dishes into the kitchen while she loads the dishwasher. She cleans the kitchen as any cook would and the job is eventually complete. He then goes over everything wiping down the handles of the refrigerator, stove, microwave - everything. Even as most were unused or already clean. He mops the floor with yesterday’s water even as it is unnecessary. This is something he is required to do in his brain. She used to take offense but now just accepts this compulsion.
After this is checklisted away he reasons how simple beans and franks would have sufficed. Less to deal with. He then walks the dogs again and goes to bed. In the morning she knows he will vacuum the bedroom rugs as he always does, right after his shower. Check.

738,"I have OCPD and i can try to explain what makes those two come close yet so different.
First they both seem to have a very strong love for perfection which is why they both are productive in work and are most likely to become Head positions. Difference is thought that someone with OCPD believes that he is never good enough. He tries to achieve perfection at the expense of friends, emotions and sometimes even family so the person with OCPD is too busy with his mission to achieve perfection and has no time for anything else. In work, people with OCPD try to do too much work because they “want” to be perfect yet someone with NPD thinks he is “already perfect”. Someone with NPD will be entitled to do higher tasks and believes that with lowers tasks, that he is above that task. So both love perfection and worship it and they are both on a mission but in different views. OCPD: Is very criticising of himself and thinks he or she is never good enough and needs to do better. They are never satsified with themselves and try to become perfect meanwhile NPD: Thinks he or she is already perfect and tries to prove that he or she is perfect to others.
They are both very rigid and not flexible at all. They also seem to be somehow stuck in their own self but with OCPD they are busy making lists, second guessing themselves, ruminating, overcomplicating life, thinkign about a perfect plan but they think so much that they will never start it because they are to stuck in their complex mindsets of rules and system. Meanwhile people with NPD are in their mind to obsessed with themselves and they always just think and see themselves. Because they think they are already the best and perfect, they see no reason to change. Which is where the rigid nature in those people come.
Now both have some real issue with rage but for different reasons. People with OCPD have some high standards and rules. They are very hard on themselves and others. So people with OCPD restrict their emotions because they are afraid of being hurt emotionally or exploited and they have those rules mostly related to morality and righteousness like for me i try to be the most morale person in the world and to be absolutely flawless. So they put high standards and in family life when others can`t keep up wuth their rules, they feel very angry. Mostly people with OCPD break contact with people that cannot go on with their high standards. With NPD their rage comes when people dare to disagree with them or criticizing them because the narcissist is arrogant and believes he is superior in all areas. I think people with OCPD are frustrated because they cannot become perfect or flawless meanwhile people with NPD are frustrated because they fail at proving others that they are the best.
Well OCPD is a cluster c personality disroder so more one of the anxiety and avoidant type. People with OCPD tend to rather avoid people and live for themselves alone. Meanwhile people with NPD are cluster b personality disorders so more in the anti social category so those with NPD seek people but use them and do not really care about them.
One big thing that sets them apart is that people with NPD have no empathy or decide to show no empathy to anyone. Meanwhile those with OCPD actually try to empathize but they are not really good at it. With the OCPD people, they tend to show only empathy torwards very intellectual, rigid and behaving individuals like myself. People that do not fit into their rule system mostly get the cold shoulder. Another main difference is how they approach people and how they both have a conflcit with society: A person with OCPD dreams of a world where everyone follows the same rule system as they wish because they believe that the way they think is the best option. Because the world is not going with their rules, people with OCDP desperately avoid people. Sometimes they even avoid and run away from their loved ones so like in my case people with OCPD might lose firends and loved ones by simply avoiding them all the time. People with OCPD have extreme anxiety and think that relationships and bonds will never work because the other people are incapable to follow their hig standard rules so they better not start to meet people anyway.
A person with NPD dreams of a world where everything moves about them and everyone sees them as the best. Donald Trump falls highly into the narcissistic roster because he is talking a lot about himself and boosts himself up and the entire world giving him attention is the ultimate dream of any narcsissist. In contract to thhose with OCPD, people with NPD seek people and use charm, deception and manipulation to get people show them attention and admire them. At the beginning everything is good with a narcissist but when the criticizing and stop of attention comes in, they terrorize, devalue and emotionally destroy people. Those with NPD can only live properly with codependent and submissive personalities that give them exactly what they want.
Now a big contrast is that people with OCPD never really talk about themselves. When you praise them, they will think it is not really special what they do. They talk a lot about topics like politics, history, news, films but what they avoid to speak about is anything about their emotions or themselves deeply because they hate to show feelings ebcause they trust no one and think you could bully, exploit or attack them emotionally. They show less emotion and a more formal way. You can actually itneract with them nicely but they always will be formal and serious. They will always try not to became relaxed. They are always serious. They also only see the negative in life and mostly have very pesimistic views. Now with NPD they talk a lot about themselves and unlike the OCPD, they show a lot of let`s say reactions in their face but the cold truth is that people with NPD just show fake emotions. A fake mask. In truth they need you to give them attention and admire them. They are actually going to always interupt discussion with you and other people and try to actually stick by you and if you tell them it is annoying, they will make themselves vicitms and make you look bad.
It is also funny to note, that people with OCPD have extremely strict rules and actually keep true to them and are very cirticizing of themselves. People with NPD break rules all the time and just don`t care and they see not negative in themselves.
Those with OCPD want to be perfect and those with NPD think they are perfect.
People with OCPD force themselves to be selfess and they try to be absolutely righteous, morale and let us say they are very unforgiving of themselves and others even with minor things. They try to never make any mistake and always put others people needs above them. Their desires and needs are sacrificed for the sake of their complex and high rules. People with NPD become slef absorbed the very opposite of OCPD and they think only about themselves and try to use, emotionally dry people and serve themselves. In fact the person with OCPD is on a mission to become the ultimate selfess man of justice and puts himself beneath everyone and the person with NPD is on a mission to become the selfish man of evil even though they do not consider being evil. Both live very depressing lives. But the NPD disorder has more attention because the person with NPD is hurting and destroying others alongside himself meanwhile those with OCPD stay alone and only destroy themselves.
And finally there is one thing that is similar. In some way because i am OCPD myself, both have some form of feeling superior but again in different ways. The person with OCPD beleives that his way of doing things is the best so he considers himself equal with everyone but he thinks that only those with very high standars, restricted selfs and strict rules are superior and everyone else are shameless and irritating. The people with NPD thínk they are best and it is about their self. So maybe we should say the OCPD sees perfection in what he does and the NPD sees in perfection in who he is.
Also the reason why both are described of lacking empathy is this. In NPD`s case indeed they lack empathy because they are too busy with themselves but the person with OCPD has empathy but shows it only to those that can keep with his or her extreme rules. In relationships, they are very formal. While the narcissits needs attention and will have sex and kisses with the partner, the OCPD`s most likely will not allow feelings and touches because they ae paranoid of being attacked. They will most likely have high standards and when the partner cannot keep up, the OCPD person will instantly break up and run away from the relationship because they want a perfect relationship without conflcit and msitake and one msitake and conflcit proves them that the relationship is not worth it.
People with NPD are too offensive and step over your boundaries and people with OCPD are too defensive and run away from you. I think people with NPD are extremely dangerous and you should look out for them. People with OCPD such as myself are not dangerous at all they are actually very afraid and scared of life but they will mostly hide in their homes and spend more time alone with themselves.
It is extremely complex. Maybe sub consciously people with OCPD want everyone to think like them and people with NPD want everyone to think about them.
In the end they have more contrast and similarities. I think they both faced the same trauma in the style of emotional abuse and yeah for a bullied and emotionally abused person they will choose one of two options
Option 1: I will become very defensive, avoiding of life, paranoid and always suspect everyone of plotting against me. I will see no value in me and feel inferior. I will not itneract with people because they will betray and dissapoint anyway. Yeah i better not start anything and live alone with my own style of living and rules. And this decision to avoid aynthing and see life as a survival where you always watch out for danger will result in OCPD.
Option 2: I will destroy others before they destroy me. I will prove that i will be the most superior. I will laugh at them. They will look up on me and move on their knees to say sorry. They will not be able to explot or destroy me because i am always gonna be above them. And this decision of becoming entirly selfish and going the offensive results in NPD.
They both have the same source of trauma most likely they had a parent never being satisfied with them and i think it depends on the individual in the end how their personality disorder evolves.
The bad ending is that people with NPD will be hated by everyone for their toxic nature and they will be forced into a self destructive stae of loneliness. The potential of bad ending for the person with OCPD is that they will be unnoticed and stay alone by free choice but they will probably enhance their rules. The rules become more strict and higher which reuslts in them becoming very self destructtive. They still have a much better reputation than most people because people with OCPD never attack anyone but themselves. What a narcissist does to others is what someone with OCPD is doing to themselves. People with NPD abuise others and people with OCPD abuse themselves. I for example were always hard and unfroginvg of myself for my msitakes. I even see myself responsible for others.
OCPD has the goal to be the Judge of life who is responsible for everyone. NPD has the goal to be the King of life who is everyones sun.",OCD
739,"This is not a good ‘mixture’ AT ALL …… it’s just like oil and water! And even when the pw/NPD (the oil) tries to ‘shake things up’ to confuse everything in order to get their way, the pw/OCD (the water) eventually figures it out and the ‘mixture’ always separates again……and again and again, etc!!! It will NEVER work!!!",OCD
740,"A person With a comorbidity of Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and Obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD) will typically maintain a distinct philosophical belief that everyone around them should do absolutely anything and everything so as to ensure that the narcissist feels special and revered.
One of the dominant features of Narcissism is a distinct sense of entitlement. When combined with OCD, a person with NPD is not able to recognise the need for change of their own behaviors and instead believe that others should change. When this 'change' in others do not occur, a narcissist will likely become extremely enraged while experiencing a sense of excessive disappointed.
The component of OCD behaviorwill essentially act to reinforce and even justify the behavioural component of NPD. As a narcissist maintains the belief that they are superior, the element of OCD behavior functions as a visual display of their superior status and as such will engage in obsessive ritual like behaviours and patterns in order to win and maintain the favour and admiration of others. Additionally, such obsessive compulsive behaviours functions to reinforce their sense worth as well as their desire for beauty, power, success and/or perfect love, all of which are consistent with their fantasy idealisations.
A narcissist lack of empathy effectively positions them in having little to no concern for how their OCD behavior could/can negatively impact others which in-turn can further the excessive and absolute like demands of automatic compliance from others, irrespective of other’s beliefs or personal contexts.
It is Important to remember that narcissist, because of their self perception of superiority and perfection, will generally not see any problem with their OCD behaviours and will actually accuse others of being jealous of their OCD behaviours. Consistent with this premise, a narcissist will pridefully boast of their OCD behaviours and even encourage (or manipulate) others to be like them and adopt the same OCD behavioural patterns.
While there may be no specific and Universal set of OLD behaviours of a narcissist, there is unarguably a definate strong strand in the overall behaviour of a narcissist. The obsessive ritual like behaviours of a narcissist could likely be the result of the narcissist attempting to rid themselves of their inner demons (through ritualistic acts and behaviours) While at the sametime projecting an appearance of superiority and perfection. A narcissishas a pervasive and pathological need for 'supply' and so their very pursuit of a supply source can be seen as compulsive.",OCD
741,"Quite simply, you can gain your path to the spiritual awakening that you have been waiting for through all the pathological lying, blame casting, gaslighting, and all the other assholery.
Whether you were discarded by a narc, or you initiate the discard, you will feel pain, confusion, fear, regret, etc. During this time, it is important to remember that you have now been given the opportunity to find your true self.
This is solid gold for you. If you were involved with, and mind fucked by, a narc, it is imperative that you take responsibility for allowing yourself to be subjected to this bullshit.
Then, forgive yourself, and start to self-reflect on the past pains and traumas you may have endured as a child, that enabled your attraction of the narc to you. The narc has built-in radar that detects these things in you. The narc also experienced pains and trauma as a child, but did not develop a conscience or the ability to love, as you were likely fortunate enough to develop.
Once you dig up all the past traumas that wounded your own inner child, you can release them. Doing this alone is not easy. It may require therapy, or other forms of psychological healing. In any event, this is how you find your true self, and once found, you can experience life as a kind, loving individual, who treats all others as you would want to be treated.
I started working to find my own center about a year and a half before my ex-narc discarded me. The funny thing is, I started that journey in hopes of saving my marriage! Hahahahahahahaha!!
However, I am lucky that I did start that journey before discard. I would have been completely destroyed if I hadn’t. Regardless, the discard was still tough, and excruciatingly painful. I regressed a bit, but now, 3 months later, I have reached acceptance, and am now redoubling my effort at going inside and completing that endeavor to fully discover my true self.
Bottom line: I needed this narc in my life to kick my ass into discovering who the fuck I really am, and I am so grateful I am finally on that journey. I am still working on it, but am well on my way. I have even forgiven the narc for being who she is. It fell on deaf ears, I am certain, but it has liberated me from the excruciating pain.
What have I discovered so far? I am an intuitive empath. Who knew? I ignored that for so long, and it resulted in so much investment in a woman who could not have given 2 fucks, much less 1. I have also discovered that my father was a narcissist, and I was used and devalued for most of my upbringing, and well into adulthood, until his dying day. I also have been searching externally all my life for love and acceptance, never fully finding them, and always wondering WTF?
This is a journey worth taking! I am in the beginning stages of actually learning that I can have this love and acceptance from myself!! When I have this fully developed, I am told that I will attract the right people, I.e., the neurotypical , loving, caring, empathetic, kind, compassionate people I deserve to have in my life. I fully see the truth in this.
This is what I have gained from the narcissist. The process was heartbreaking, but of such great value. I hope this helps!",OCD
742,"The most common way a narcissist will mess with someone’s head is through the use of Gaslighting.
Gaslighting is perhaps one of the most insidious forms of psychological manipulation as it essentially causes the victim, over time, to doubt their own nature of reality, version of truths, version of events, and even their very own identity.
Gaslighting is essentially a form of psychological manipulation and severe emotional abuse. The narcissist (gaslighter) will avoid responsibility for their toxic behaviour by lying, denying, and making their victim question the facts including their memory and very feelings/emotions as well as intuitions.
A narcissist will use gaslighting to essentially make their victim feel crazy and confused.",OCD
743,"To be honest, they think everyone is trying to play them all the time, so the reality is that narcissists believe they are either getting played or are in danger of being played all the time. They're very paranoid and fearful people inside.
However, to specifically answer your question... it's unlikely they would consciously realize it even happened. More than likely they would have already constructed a narrative in their minds in which they were the “winner.”
If they did consciously realize it, then either the rage would be apocalyptic and so would the punishment / retaliation or the shame would drive them completely out of the situation.",OCD
744,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD
745,"Cognitive therapies can help. An awareness of what is happening with thought intrusions and that it is not psychosis provides some relief. Also knowing that the thoughts don't reflect hidden desires helps. For instance, sexual thoughts counter to the person's sexual orientation don't mean the person is the opposite of their current orientation.
There is a “tapping” method that helps some people when the thought intrusions occur. Google it to get a better description but basically it it involves: tapping the top of the head several times, 7 is a good number. Then repeat with tapping to forehead, cheekbones, upper lip, chin, neck and chest or shoulders. Some spots might be a little different. Some people repeat a mantra during the process such as “I am worthy and deserve better ideas” or something similar. The theory of the effectiveness is the vagus nerve stimulation helps rid the intrusive thoughts.
Once people learn to cope with the thoughts when the thoughts return, they can often have success by just ignoring the thoughts. Just ignoring the thoughts helps in some situations like driving a car or while performing tasks at work or home.
Getting songs stuck in the head can be troublesome.though. Listening to other songs might help get rid of the offending pieces of music.",OCD
746,"Some ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) exercises can be done individually, on your own.
ERPA exercises address each one of these events. First, you select a trigger for a particular obsession-compulsion combination and then practice exposure to this trigger. During the exposure, the next step is to refrain from rituals and instead practice awareness of the distress. When this is successfully done, the distress fades away. Because the obsessions t...

747,"Meds. You have to take into account that meds will help with the symptoms, but they won't really solve the core issue.
The best way to treat OCD is with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and if it's needed also medication.
Outside of that engaging in activities that require a lot of self-control and discipline may help, but I can't guarantee they'll cure OCD.",OCD
748,"Short answer no. My neurologist told me that it is mainly a result of a traumatic situation that has occurred in ones life. After being properly diagnosed, there are meds that can help control ones uncontrollable habits and help organize ones thoughts.",OCD
749,"No, but it’s not all bad news. Everyone has OCD tendencies, it’s not just on/off, it’s more like a spectrum. Most people live a “normal” life and learn to deal with it. As such, it’s not a disorder. In fact, obsessions and compulsions are part of normal psychological functioning. Other bad things would happen if we couldn’t have these at all, if we were “cured” from them.
However, they become a disorder when they disrupt your life, causing you and people around you distress or harm, and stopping you from achieving your goals.
It’s a bit like E.coli, that bacteria on which we depend for digestion, but which can kill us if it gets into places it shouldn’t.",OCD

751,"Treatment for OCD in kids/teenagers is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In therapy, kids/teenagers learn coping and calming skills for anxiety. They learn how to safely face fears without doing rituals.
Along with therapy, doctors may give medicines for OCD to some kids. For kids who need medicines, doctors give SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). These include Zoloft®, Prozac®, and Luvox®.
Treatment works best when a parent or caregiver goes to therapy with their child. That way, they can learn how to coach their child through OCD symptoms, help their child practice skills they learn in therapy, and offer daily support.

752,"I have answered another similar question: Kyrani Eade's answer to I have Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD) , the intrusive thoughts are unbearable. I started to feel a pain on my chest and lack of concentration. What is the solution to this issue?",OCD
753,"It is possible to be cured of any desease by spontaneous remission, but it is harder and very rare: this goes for mental illnesses as well as for apendicites or cancer.",OCD
754,"I would have to say no. As an OCD sufferer myself, the CBT that I had made my OCD worse. It made me question everything. It made me miserable. Every thought I had I tried to analyze, and it was overwhelming. I hated it. Telling a person who’s prone to obsessive thoughts to analyze, question, destruct, and argue with every single thought they have is pretty backwards logic, if you think about it. My therapist agrees now that this kind of therapy is not right for OCD, or at least not my OCD anyway. I guess everyone is different though, but if my experience of OCD is anything like others, I don’t see how a CBT approach would be appropriate. Seems like the exact opposite of what you should be doing. It made me more indecisive, which is a big part of my OCD - seeing every pro and con of something so much that no decision can ever be made. I’ve actually had more success with the silly ‘radical acceptance’ approach. Basically, you can’t fight it, so don’t. And don’t try to overthink it or analyze it or argue with it. Let the thoughts come, and let them pass.",OCD
755,"Yeah, it will. It’s only the first step though. CBT is where you develop the self-awareness and tools to tackle OCD. Fear driven obsessions still need to be extincted by not following through with compensatory behaviours whether they are in the form of rituals (of thought or action) or are aversive in nature. This process is the meat of recovery. I’m 27 and I haven’t fully recovered. I’ve had it for life and I’ve been hospitalized before.
I’ve had periods where my OCD symptoms abated following putting in the work to decouple my obsessions and the unhealthy coping mechanisms that follow, however. I at least know that there is respite at this age. It’s something that you will always nag at you, I think. I can see it in my personality, too. I think it’s just the way my brain is structured. That’s okay, though. I still have a choice, and what doesn’t kill you makes you stranger.
I think people with OCD have a restlessness about them. They need comfort from something that hurts deep inside. They’re anxious, and need to exert control over something to make order from chaos. They continually seek out a sense of peace, and when they have it they continually fear it escaping them. When these people can’t address the trappings of their mind that cause them this unrest, they find another way to seize control. They make rules for themselves. They seek a neat and tidy existence loosely inspired by the pain and fear that lingers just outside their consciousness. This is just me, but I think OCD might just be a coping mechanism that some people develop to deal with highly unpleasant feelings and experiences that they do not have to power to make go away.",OCD
756,"Yes. Therapy for OCD is usually a type of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) [1] with exposure and response prevention (ERP).
This involves:
* working with your therapist to break down your problems into their separate parts, such as your thoughts, physical feelings and actions
* encouraging you to face your fears and have obsessive though...",OCD
757,"To be honest. I did it with shear will-power it wasn’t easy at all. I just told myself that i need to accept it every morning until one day it was completely gone without me knowing. Then i actually remember it’s been quite a well since i had any intrusion thoughts. it took me about 2 months to accept it and till this day i’m perfectly fine.
It’s different for everyone and not something i’d wish upon anyone. My mind was working overtime 24/7. But i’m glad that will power actually worked, because i didnt want medication.
But please remember to get over OCD. you need to accept that you have it to move forward.",OCD
758,Medicine and behavior modification- although it sometimes doesn't work entirely- for instance I clean my house because no one can clean better - sounds stupid- I re-fold clothes etc - it a control that you maintain while your narc thinks he has total control. I also have the who touched my stuff or moved it 1/2 in - my son does that,OCD
759,"Maybe. It depends on many factors. Your question is like asking…is aspirin good for pain? The answer would also be maybe, it depends on many factors. CBT is not a uniform technique. It has specific guidelines but there is much latitude in how they can be used. OCD is not a uniform disorder. This also complicates matters.
The complexity of MI cannot be specifically addressed on Quora. There are too many unknown factors, too much missing information. Questions can be answered in a general way so, to get to the point the answer is, in general yes, CBT can be effective for OCD, specifically, I really don’t know.
Steve DeBerry's answer to Why is cognitive behavioral therapy the most widely used evidence-based practice for improving mental health?",OCD
760,"No: general psychotherapy or counselling is not the first line evidence based approach. For OCD Exposure Therapy with response prevention is the treatment of choice unless there are specific good reasons not to use this approach. You should try to find someone with specific CBT or ET training with significant experience of treating OCD, not someone who calls themselves a psychotherapist.
There are one of two accessible books about this subject which can be used for self-help eg. Daring to Challenge OCD: Overcome Your Fear of Treatment and Take Control of Your Life Using Exposure and Response Prevention – 11 Sept. 2014 Joan Davidson.",OCD

It consists of addressing the irrational beliefs, intrusive thoughts and heightened importance given by the sufferer to occurance of the worst outcome. This is done via counseling the sufferer.

762,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
763,"It’s very unlikely. I guess anything is possible, but OCD is, for some people, a severe and disabling condition. It’s not a character flaw or a bad habit that can just be overcome by sheer willpower. I suppose to some extent, everyone can (or at least should be able to) control their behaviors. So if anything, you may be able to reduce or stop yourself from performing some compulsions, since those are generally (but not always) actions/behaviors. I don’t think you can control your obsessions because those are thoughts. If thoughts were easy to ignore or stop, then there would be no need to psychologists or psychiatrists, right?
Also, if you are able to stop your compulsions, which might be behaviors or actions, what might end up happening is that you develop mental compulsions. Since those are thoughts, no one but you would know that you are doing them. So to onlookers, you might appear better, but you might actually be worse - more consumed by unwanted thoughts and mental rituals.
Also, my understanding is that the more you try to push away unwanted thoughts, the more they occur. Therapists have always told me when OCD thoughts are really bad, don’t try to argue with the thoughts. Don’t try to push them away. It just won’t work. The better option is distraction, but not actively fighting the thoughts. Let the thoughts be there, just don’t focus on them. But don’t ignore them. It’s hard for sure. So I guess I don’t know how you’d even propose overcoming OCD with ‘force of will’. If that means arguing or fighting with the thoughts, I’d have to say no, that won’t work. If it means distracting, not giving into the compulsions, noticing the thoughts, but not focusing on them…then maybe.",OCD

765,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

766,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",OCD
767,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder for me is that when you even don't want or like, but you would do things in a certain way, or do certain things. And the important point here is that you don't feel pleasant or comfortable when you doing that. you are just simply been compelled by an inner force to do that, otherwise, you feel or expect that something horrible would happen. And that fear is based on our repressed experience rather than a rational one. It seems like something had programmed you to behave that way, and that program is in charge of your life. The content of the program is about your unique reacting style in each different situation. (it really far more than tidy or order) Sometimes people call this way a routine that gives us security.
But the essence of this disorder is, you lose lots of amount of control (autonomy) about your life due to this ingrained pattern. Some people see that there is a similarity or deep connection between Compulsion and Addiction. Both of them can make us engage in a certain activity or do things in a certain way. And we are so powerless to control the whole process. But I think the difference is that OCD originates from some repressed deep fear, whereas Addiction is developing from the buried unmet emotional need deep in infancy.
Cause of OCD in my view: our history, especially our childhood experience shapes us that way, in our childhood situation, or the early relationship with our parents. there is some invincible feeling of insecurity pervasive alongside this type of disorder. that means we may feel some threat or uncertainty in our situation when we were so powerless and vulnerable.
We need to adapt to the requirement of the environment or parents to survive if we were not been loved by our parents unconditionally. A child can only be who he truly is when he is been loved and accepted unconditionally, and have our real autonomous emotional development. that's the essence of being the real version of ourselves and truly free and liberating.
But if we haven't been that lucky, then our experience and the environment would mold us in a certain way. That pattern form from that mold is our struggling to survive, and it reflects our survival strategy. And when we are young and still live in the same or similar situation of that mold, then our pattern of reaction or behavior won't bother us so much, because it works and helpful for our daily issue, even though we ain't truly free and autonomous, that means been our trueself. Many people live in a backward and conservative community, for example, a thirty world village or small town, they simply unconscious continue that pattern they develop in their childhood experience all their life. Sometimes they project their inner fear and impotence about their situation to the relationship between nature. And develop a certain way of life-style base on the idea of superstition. And don't label it as a mental problem. I think maybe that's why OCD is usually related to religion.
the hidden fear about some coming threat and the intrusive thought maybe the very similar mental process a religious people had a hundred years ago. And therefore they need the idea of “God” to help them coordinate their chaotic situation.
Now we live in a world of changing, we must sustain all our autonomy to be who we are to make the proper choice or deal with daily work more rationally and efficiently. Then our ingrained pattern and the certain compulsive behavior related to it become our problem and torment us. But awareness is the first step to change, evolve, and heal ourselves. and I am still struggling a little bit, trying to search the roots in my childhood experience and try to liberate myself from this inner prison.",OCD
768,"OCD is an acronym for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. OCD is an anxiety disorder that involves obtrusive thoughts or obsessions that are responded to often in form of a ritual, the compulsion.
A common example of OCD is when someone has undesired thoughts about themselves or a loved one getting sick (obsession). In order to alleviate the thoughts, they feel the need to constantly clean (compulsion).",OCD
769,"Contrary to the common belief, OCD is not about being tidy, organized, and so on. What OCD is, is a thought, or an obsession, creeping into your head, through sensory stimuli or a stream of thoughts, and getting all of your attention. It can last for hours, days, or weeks. The degree of intensity of the obsession varies based on different factors. Often times your head makes cases for it by prying on your loved ones or your deepest fears. It may also present itself as a utterly disgusting image or thought. This triggers an emotional and physical response (a fight or flight response) which makes the obsession feel real to the person affected. What follows is a suggestion from your brain that is supposed to make everything right. It magically makes you save your loved ones, make your obsession disappear and your anxiety with it. It’s a compulsion. This is an action, usually with meaning associated to it, used to neutralize the obsession. It can be tapping, cleaning your hands and so on, either a specific number of times or until it feels just right. It can also be something degrading you don’t want to do. This can take from a few seconds, to minutes, depending on how upsetting the obsession is to you. With really strong OCD the obsession may even not go away with just a compulsion, and you may need to do more than one. In that case it make also take hours. Sometimes really strong obsessive thoughts may come back to haunt you months, or even years after.
So, OCD is a mechanism that your brain puts up to deal with high, constant anxiety. Often the source of the anxiety is something out of your control, so your brain turns your attention onto something that you can actually control.
Doing the compulsion is actually making the OCD stronger. It is reinforcing this whole cycle that starts with an obsession popping into your head. It makes subsequent obsessions more vivid and real, and subsequent compulsions less and less effective the more you use them to fight obsessions. It’s often the case that people with OCD develop new, more complex and time-consuming compulsions to overcome the OCD getting stronger, or that new types of obsessions are being developed. So OCD is an evolving mental disorder.
The most successful treatments for OCD are medication and CBT. With medication you’d start taking antidepressants (they work as anxiolytic as well) to reduce your levels of anxiety and therefore fight it at the source. You’d keep on taking medication for a few years ahead, in average. It works in most cases and I’d recommend it in severe cases. Although you’d have to deal with side effects from the medication and the symptoms may come back once you stop taking it. I’d recommend CBT to anyone with OCD, even if you’re already taking medication as medication and CBT work well together. CBT is about getting to understand your OCD. Understand how it works, how it develops, understand your specific triggers, your compulsions and what they mean to you. And then act on it to make obsessions less and less strong. CBT also trains you to deal with your OCD such that in the future, after the treatment, if your brain tries to put on the same mechanism again, you’re already prepared and know how to counteract.",OCD
770,"OCPD is a personality disorder marked by one's need for power over their environment. People with OCPD (unlike OCD, which is a separate anxiety disorder) are satisfied by the completion of their ritualized behavior, such as making lists, or memorizing, and remembering minutiae.

People with OCPD use a strict enforcement of behavioral norms to regulate the anxiety they feel in social situations, and may judge themselves and others harshly by their adopted code of conduct. They are often prone to obsessive behaviors, such as being a workaholic, or a hoarder.",OCD
771,"To simplify what OCD is I’ll put it in simplistic:
Obsessive compulsive disorder abbreviated as OCD, is an anxiety based disorder that causes distress and impairment to the individual enduring it.
OCD is based on obsessions and compulsions, which are two distinct factors but heavily correlated.
Obsessions are unpleasant, undesirable, usually involuntary, thoughts, ideas, images or impulse, that are hard to waver and are constant, obsessions are originated from a certain fear, that is generally irrational, by irrational I mean very unlikely, holding very little validity and exaggerated in general.
Examples would include fear of contamination—being contaminated by anything the individual deems unpleasant, this could range from physical to mental, physical being touching unclean dishes to mental being, having certain sexual thoughts.
Obsessions cause the individual to feel discomfort and paranoid.
Compulsions are reptitive behaviours, thoughts, to engage in obsessions in order to dwindle them in some way, which results in very little efficient outcomes in dwindling the obsessions and concludes in the obsessions returning.
Compulsions can be internal, or external, they could range from checking the alarm a dozen times, to counting to certain numbers in your head in order to prevent the obsessions from dominating your thoughts.
Compulsions range from hoarding, checking, contamination, exactness, and counting, and furthermore.
Certain individuals have a concept labeled ‘rules’. In order to not take up so much time in sorting compulsions a rule they deem easier is made, for example if someone were to usually wash their hands three times everytime they touch, or brush past, a plate near sink, instead it would modify to whenever they touch the plate four times is when they'll wash their hands. In certain cases the individual would increase the number in order to not oblige to their obsessions and compulsions but the cycle usually ends up in them being indecisive of whether to still, or not do their compulsions.
OCD takes up a lot of time, and could distract one’s mandatory priority in replacement for obliging with compulsions instead.",OCD
772,"Thanks for the A2A,

It is related to the body clock and how can you bring it under control.

779,"Hey human,
Habit is an action or behavior learned in response to a stimulus that gives reward which eventually turns into a subconscious behavior without reward. Habits are sometimes automatic consequences of actions or behaviors that we enact.
Compulsion is a behavior that produces no reward, but the individual still does that uncontrollably. It is a presumable behavior, where we force ourselves to do it.
But, when a habit becomes excessive and uncontrollable which eventually results in unhealthy behaviors, then it is termed as a compulsion.
People get obsessive-compulsive disorder due to many reasons. Such as biological causes, wherein family members have the disorder; it may also be due to misinterpreted thoughts that become more extreme or intense; Stressful situations such as any traumatic event that happened in the past might lead to obsessive-compulsive disorder and it may be also due to anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse or tic disorders. Sometimes it will be acute in cases such as when the child gets strep throat, cold or Lyme disease, they might have OCD which will disappear within some days, but there are chances to return in the future. The onset of OCD is also seen after childbirth, complications during pregnancy or delivery, a severe conflict, complex illness, and traumatic brain injury.
The common symptoms of obsessiveness are unwanted thoughts, needed things orderly, doubting, and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty. The common symptoms of compulsiveness are washing, cleaning, checking, counting, and following a strict routine. When any of these symptoms interfere with the regular functioning of life, the individual has to seek the help of mental health professional.
Hope this helps you, take care!",OCD

2)I want other to say word “cancel “ if any of there word hurts or disturbs me. I feel If they don't say so.. Something bad is going to happen for my loved ones
3) sometimes point 2 , makes me angry if someone hesitate to say CANCEL, which further disturbs my mood and turns me frantic, and make me pray crying.
4) some times weird images of dead body of my loved ones( the sole impetus for my existence in this world) comes to my mind, which splits my soul Out of body,which compels me to pray

782,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
783,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

784,"Absolutely.
Rereading, rewriting, respelling, reediting, replaying, etc.
These are all very common with OCD.
They are all forms of compulsive behaviors (safety behaviors).
Typically, this is being done out of fear/anxiety, which is caused by an obsession.
The obsession will always vary depending on the individuals underlying fears.
I’ve had clients do similar compulsions for the following reasons:
Ensuring they fully understand the information
For fear that something bad will happen to them or a loved one
Need to understand perfectly
Fear of getting a bad grade
Fear of failing
Fear of not going to college, getting a good job, ending up homeless, etc.
Even the fear they misread a text which could cause a breakdown in a relationship
Reassuring themselves that they did it right
These are just a few examples.
Again, everyone’s OCD will be unique to them so they will have a different underlying fears.
If you want to know why you are doing this, you could ask yourself, what would happen if I don’t replay or reread the sentence over and over again? What would happen?

Can't control his or her thoughts or behaviors, even when those thoughts or behaviors are recognized as excessive
Spends at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors
Doesn’t get pleasure when performing the behaviors or rituals, but may feel brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause
Experiences significant problems in their daily life due to these thoughts or behaviors.

So if any of the above symptoms apply to the writer then writing has become an obsession.
I think sometimes creative energies make you obsessed (in a general sense) to complete the task at hand so much so that it occupies your entire life. That is different from OCD as post the creative outburst or post reaching the goal you go back to your normal routime without needing any interventions.",OCD
786,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
787,"Yes it can be a part of OCD. Here is the explanation.
OCD has two parts: obsession (I should read it otherwise something bad will happen) and the compulsion (rereading).. Which takes place because you assume yourself to be responsible to take care of that something bad happening.. And also cause you feel that there is a need to undo thinking about something horrible which you try and do by rereading.
Tolerating your anxiety caused by your obsession and not reacting with the compulsion and taking your meds regularly is the only thing that will make you stronger to fight your OCD and you will definitely recover ..

788,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD

Writing is an incredible addiction. It consumed 2 years of my life until yesterday when I finally called it quits.
I understand how you feel. The all consuming world that you create is magnificent, magical even. Know this, after a few hundreds of rejections you’ll start to despair. If you want my advice, it would be to write only for fun. Its an incredibly frustrating journey if you decide to eventually write a book and get it published. I know because I’ve tried.
You start out optimistic and slowly but surely the enthusiasm wains the more you get rejected. I know because I ignored anything and everything saying that I wouldn’t make it as a writer. I went to conferences, and spent about $4,000 trying to self-publish and promote my manuscripts.
Unless you are willing to stick it out for five to ten years you probably wont end up becoming a published author. Even then, I had a coworker who had been going at it 20 years and hadn’t broken in. She worked with me at Wells Fargo before I quit a year ago.
Write for fun, or have your passion ruined by the publishing industry’s incredibly subjective standards. There’s no solid path to becoming a famous/published author.

In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

793,"Writing is an addiction. Hell, yes. I see you have already figured that out.
Having a piece accepted for publication is a total rush.
But that rush doesn't even start to compare to a really awesome writing session. Have you ever gone into a trance and had time stop meaning anything as you channeled your characters?
Have you realized you let your leg fall asleep and your neck crick because you couldn't bother to adjust your body position?
Have you ever gotten so lost in the fictional world you were creating that it was more real than reality?
If you can say yes to any of that, you already have enough reason to keep writing.
Keep working hard to master your craft. One day somebody will buy something you wrote.",OCD
794,"I was around 12 years old, and I remember sat in my room and I suddenly got a thought - ‘I want my family to die’.
This thought caused me intense anxiety and distress, and I couldn't stop thinking it (intrusive thought). Everytime I thought it I would have to think a neutralising thought such as ‘I don't want my family to die’. I cried all the time because of it, but I didn't tell anyone because I was certain I would be sent to a ‘'mental hospital’ or to jail.
About a year later I looked up my symptoms and found out I had OCD, and I cried with relief. It wasn't just me. I wasn't insane. I was just experiencing intrusive thoughts.",OCD
795,"I never “realized"" that I had OCD. I realized that my life was being severely negatively affected by uncontrollable thoughts and behaviors that I didn't really understand, so I got myself into therapy, where I was diagnosed with OCD.
I was actually surprised at the diagnosis. Like most people, I thought at the time that having OCD meant being a germophobe, and needing everything tidy and orderly. That wasn't my deal. Checking was (and still is) my thing: stove, light switches, door locks, electrical cords, etc. Counting, too, and an obsession with “safe"" and “unsafe” numbers. I had no idea that these were obsessive-compulsive behaviors. It was 2007. There wasn't as much information out there as there is now.
This question kind of bothers me, because there is a frightening overabundance of self-diagnosis these days when it comes to mental health. People with no medical or mental health credentials read a few articles or watch a couple of movies and decide that they (or someone else) have some kind of mental health disorder, be it OCD, ADHD, NPD, bipolar, whatever. It's dangerous and irresponsible.
People also romanticize mental health disorders, as if they're a cool thing to have, which I also don't understand.
You need a diagnosis from a mental health professional to know you have OCD, or any other mental health condition.",OCD
796,"Hello, thank you for the answer request
For basic understanding of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder you need to check for patterns that can be indicative of OCD such as:-
Excessive hoarding
Excessive cleaning
Checking and rechecking
Being stuck with order and symmetry.
Repeating an action in number of 3 (such as washing face or blinking 3 times)
Perform seemingly nonsensical behaviour
Self doubting or doubting others due to false memory, etc.
Having said that one needs to understand that symptoms do not make a disorder, dysfunctionality does. So you can be highly organised or hold on to invaluable things but it doesn't necessarily equate to being OCD.
OCD is an anxiety based disorder and a key characteristic of it is the OCD cycle, which is:-
Obsessive thoughts: stress provoking and unwanted thoughts, urges and mental images. It may also include doubtful thought or false memories.
Anxiety: it's a false alarm that leads to the need to carry out a compulsion. It can be manisfested in form of worry, fear, distress or disgust.
Compulsion: any unwanted behaviour that is carried out to get relief from anxiety.
Relief: temporary relief ; it is short lived as obsessions come back after a while.
There are various behavioural therapies that can help in breaking this vicious cycle. If you think you have OCD visit a mental health professional now.",OCD
797,"Think about times when you thought you might have had obsessive thoughts. Do you go back to check that your apartment door is locked three times no matter what the day is or how much of a rush you are in? DO you have to chew your food equally on both sides? Do you have to count your steps? Do you have to get ready or take a shower in a certain order? Do you feel panic when you don’t do these things? Or is it to a lesser extent? Do you flip out when a picture frame is a millimeter crooked? Can you go to bed knowing you didn’t fix the crookedness? Do you eat M&Ms by color or by pattern? Think about these types of things? Have you ever done anything along the lines of things like that? If so, you might be OCD. I can not verify, because only a certified psychiatrist can do that.
Now do not get OCD confused with things that are not as severe like a perfectionist who only has to have everything practically perfect. Whereas, OCD is much more than having everything perfect. Don’t get it confused with being (probably won’t spell this correctly but you’ll get the gist) anal. Being anal is OCD but not severe enough to be counted as a mental disorder. If you are anal, you don’t have to run back to your house even if you are going to be 15 minutes late to work because you didn't check the door that third time. Being anal is something everyone experiences at some point in their life but only some people can be diagnosed with OCD unlike the people who walk around saying, “Sorry. I’m just OCD” even though they aren’t.
I am OCD. Just for the record, I think it should be CDOT (alphabetical order that way) stands for Compulsive Disorder-Obsessive Type.
Hope this helped!",OCD
798,"I have been diagnosed with OCD tendencies, and I'm going to use examples my therapist expressed to me that explains OCD and why he thinks I have it. (85% chance he says, but says tendencies since I never went back to be fully diagnosed which is a different story)
I explained how I can not do my morning or night routine different. It has to be a certain order. I recited my routines to him, also explaining why I did certain things the way I did.
Example 1 he stressed to me: “when you shower, you wash your hair based on colour (I dye my hair blonde on top and keep the sides brown). You say you do this so colours don't mix. Then you wash your hands because your hair is dirty and go to wash your face. Wash hands again. Then your body. Wash hands again. Another rinse to make sure. Then cold rinse to make sure nothing stays.” I say that's correct. “The difference between just a germophobe and OCD is a germophobe does this to keep germs off. You do this each time, in that order, and restart if you mess up.” I assure that is true. “OCD causes people to do the same routine over and tend to think the worse will happen if they do not do the routine they do.” So there's one. Repeating a routine no matter how late you are or how much you mess up. It has to be that way.
Example 2: “it bothers you significantly if you notice something is missing and/or something was added to your home. People with OCD place things in certain areas and makes sure to keep them there. How many times do you not continue something until you find the thing missing or notice the thing added?” I said as long as I have to until I find it. “OCD people will [waste] time to make sure everything is exactly placed the way they know it, or your home could feel foreign.” Very true. It's like something is off and you know it is but then everything feels off.
And an extra: “perfectionism is different from OCD because perfectionism can be delayed. Like if a project is due in an hour, you won't care about detail so much because of time. OCD people have the need to do things exact, no matter how late they'll be.” That's why it's a disorder. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder - to put simply - everything must be the same the way you know it. If it is different in any way, shape, or form, you fix it no matter what. Causes repetitive actions, like you're stuck on repeat for the day over and over again.
Hope this helped.",OCD
799,"I never knew I had OCD until I was diagnosed. I had some very odd symptoms and none of which were anything that I had ever heard of as being connected to OCD. I had been seeing my therapist for a year and nothing was getting better but then I stopped eating for 10 days because I was afraid that something bad would happen so I was sent to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with OCD and shortly after realised why, because some of the things I had been talking about were actually very OCD but it was just a little disguised so we couldn’t see",OCD
800,"Skin picking disorder SPD (Excoriation) was my first symptom of what was/is of many facets of my OCD. It was soothing to the soul, it scratched an itch in my mind.
My doctor in 1964 would have laughed at the concept much less than this squirrely little boy could have mental health issues.
“He hasn’t lived long enough to be nuts!″",OCD
801,"Well, in 2021 I started having very strange fears. It started with the washing machine. One day I got a thought in my head that it was going to explode, and I couldn’t let it go. I was very aware that it wasn’t something logical, but I was deeply afraid regardless. I could sit down with you and tell you all the reason why it was a very unlikely thing to happen, but it didn’t matter the thought and fear would return. Then it spread like some kind of wild fire. It alway started with a random thought that would pop into my head usually regarding safety, at least at first. Thinking things like the storm was going to cause the tree in the front yard to blow over and we would be trapped, or when I drove over a bridge I would just have the thought of going over it into the water. So I’d have panic attacks nearly every time it stormed or we went for a drive. Then we had a part of our floor come up. it was just a small thing and we fixed it. However, I got it in my head that it would happen to the rest of the floor. I would walk around and be hyper aware of the floor. I I could feel every imperfection and hear every sound the floor made. I started to experience this dread starting around 4–5 and as the sun went down it got worse and worse. It was because I was afraid to fall asleep. I thought something like a fire would happen. Our house is old and I got the thought that maybe something is wrong with the electrical system, then it went to the heater. At the time I was miserable and didn’t know what was happening to me. I thought I was going crazy or that I was having some weird phobias or that I was in a state of some kind of psychosis (I do have bipolar). My psychiatrist at the time just kept changing my mood stabilizer, but nothing was working. Finally after 9 months I was done and decided to get a second opinion. By this point my husband had to take a leave from work because I was terrified of being alone. Again, I was very aware that I was behaving irrationally, but my body stilled had the response that I wasn’t. It was miserable. I can honestly say it is the worse thing I’ve lived through. At my second opinion appointment I described what was happening and he immediately said OCD. Afterwards he prescribed medication and within about two weeks everything got drastically better. At first my husband and I were confused because I had the intrusive thoughts for sure, but what about compulsions? After doing a little research I realized compulsions are not like in the movies. I was doing checks, but not in any obvious way. I was googling the crap out of all the possible issues with our house and I also spent large amounts of time seeking reassurance. As it turns out both are considered compulsions.",OCD
802,"In my own life
it was taking over my life nothing much more than washing everything down with bleach before the baby touched it
Germs were the culprit
Or a newborn
That's when mine symptoms got the worst in all time and I do have some funny ways not knowing it was OCD till in my twenties when I was diagnosed
Stressful germs and babies were my triggering for tenfold I already had very odd behaviour like the rituals I have before going anywhere, doors locking, I can tell if you're moved something in a millimetre from its spot, feeling unsafe anxiety issues, anxiety problems, funny habits they're got worse with my newborn so I wrote them all down and went to the doctors who referred me on than diagnosed I than learnt its even in thinking and the flows through

803,"Let me give you a quick and short test. Do any or all of these images make you feel a general malaise, anxiety, frustration and do you feel that if you don't fix them yourself soon you won't be able to sleep tonight?
If you have suffered from intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts, restlessness, apprehension, fear or worry, you may have some type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

805,"1. Perfectionism: Children with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) may have an intense need for perfection and may become extremely upset or anxious if things are not done exactly as they want.
2. Rigidity: Children with OCPD may be very rigid in their thinking and have difficulty adapting to changes in routines or plans. They may become upset if things do not go according to their plans.
3. Obsessive thoughts or behaviors: Children with OCPD may have obsessive thoughts or engage in repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing, counting, or organizing, in an attempt to reduce their anxiety.
4. Inflexible rules: Children with OCPD may have strict and inflexible rules for themselves and others. They may become upset if these rules are not followed.
5. Excessive focus on details: Children with OCPD may have an excessive focus on details and may have difficulty seeing the bigger picture. They may get stuck on minor details and have trouble completing tasks because of this.
6. Difficulty making decisions: Children with OCPD may have difficulty making decisions, as they may feel that they need to make the perfect choice. This can lead to indecisiveness and procrastination.
7. Preoccupation with order and organization: Children with OCPD may have a strong need for order and organization and may become upset if things are not in their designated place or if their routines are disrupted.
8. High levels of anxiety: Children with OCPD may experience high levels of anxiety, especially when their need for control and perfection is challenged. This can lead to feelings of distress and frustration.
9. Difficulty expressing emotions: Children with OCPD may have difficulty expressing their emotions and may appear emotionally detached or cold. They may also have difficulty understanding and empathizing with others' emotions.
10. Need for control: Children with OCPD may have an intense need for control over themselves, others, and their environment. They may become upset or anxious when they feel like they are not in control.

806,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
807,"As a child I had religious obsessions I thought about hell a lot and how it was supposed to be unending, that was hard for me to deal with and I thought for sure I’d already pissed God off enough to land in hell!

810,"Probably genetics, the environment and biology, along with a family history are key to developing anxiety disorders. With OCD, the individual is trapped in persistent thoughts( obsessions) and repetitive, ritualized behavior(compulsions) which are designed to reduce anxiety.
The disorder is characerized by recurrent, persistent, unwished for thoughts or images(obsessions) or by repetitive, ritualized, stereotyped behaviors the individual feels must be carried out in order to avoid disaster.
An individual with OCD may return several times to his home to make sure he has locked the door or turned off the gas. I once had a client who had to spin around a certain number of times before leaving the house and if he forgot the ritual, he would feel compelled to return home to complete the routine. His work was a 90 minute commute by freeway.

If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.

813,"For me the key to recovery was learning to label my intrusive thoughts, feelings and sensations. No matter how real they feel I just tell myself, ""Nope. This is an OCD thing and I know how this ends."" I do not push the thoughts away...I simply choose not to waste anymore than 2 seconds trying to figure them out.(Why am I having this thought? What does this mean? What does this say about me? Could it be true? What if? What if? What if?). Historically, me trying to answer these questions have in no way provided me with any kind of long term relief. Short term? Yes. Long term. Never. I simply choose not to engage. I observe the thought, feeling or sensation. I label it as OCD then I refocus on more important things. By the way...literally anything is more important than engaging with your OCD. As time goes on you start to see the change. Before you know it, days will have gone by and you'll think, ""Wow! I haven't thought about XYZ in a minute"", and you'll slowly start becoming more productive, stress free, and engaged. You just have to trust the process and STICK WITH IT. You may still have the thoughts, and depending on a particular obsessions impact on your life...you'll likely have them until the day you die. But you'll no longer find them distressing in the way that they use to be, and your perspective regarding them will have vastly changed...I am in OCD remission, and my life is amazing.",OCD

I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions

Now helping others be true to themselves and not controlled by the narcissistic family you may have been born into. Had to get away. Before they literal gave me a heart attack. Was I born OCD?

816,"While GAD and OCD share some similarities, they are distinct disorders with unique symptoms and diagnostic criteria. GAD involves excessive worry and generalized anxiety, whereas OCD is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Both require tailored treatment approaches. Explore my Quora Profile for more discussions on anxiety disorders.",OCD
817,"In theory, yes. But in reality, it's rather hard to tell the difference.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is about excessive, uncontrollable worry about a variety of “normal” topics, such as health, finances, relationships, personal safety, etc. GAD sufferers may just simply worry about everything. It's basically the clinical manifestation of an intense “worry wart.”
OCD that is purely obsessional, also know as “Pure-O” OCD, is different, mainly in that obsessions are supposed to be about absurd or unrealistic fears, and sufferers usually have one main obsession, sometimes a couple of them, or at least one at a time.
Again, in reality, there is so much overlap between the idea of a realistic worry and an unrealistic obsession, that it's often hard to tell the difference.
The folk psychological terms used in mental health diagnosis are largely vague and subjective, so they are tricky. But they are consistent enough that research and treatment have honed in on some familiar patterns, enough to make a dent in problematic symptoms, at least some of the time.
In the end, GAD and Pure-O are similar in their shared perseverative, cognitive form of anxiety. But they differ in their degrees of focus and realism.
Someone could definitely have both and experience both unusual or extreme obsessions, and simultaneously worry tremendously about everyday things.",OCD
818,"Anxiety disorders is the umbrella term for a group of mental health disorders such as:
Generalized anxiety disorder (gad)
Obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)
Panic disorder (pd)
Post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)
And so on.
GAD is a disorder where one constantly worries about…anything and everything. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense.
OCD, on the other hand, is a disorder with two main characteristics: obsessions and compulsions.
Obsessions are intrusive throughts that something bad will happen. Compulsions are the actions that one does to “prevent” the obsessions. (of course neither the obsessions neither the compulsions make sense).
Here's an example: “If I don't touch turn on and off the lamp 3 times, I'll die"".
OCD is also quite often characterized with fear of germs, viruses and dirt. This will make the person to wash their hands too many times, become obsessed with cleaning and they might as well end up being hypochondriac.

819,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",OCD
820,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
821,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",OCD
822,"Yes, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often also suffer from other anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and panic disorder. These comorbid conditions can complicate the diagnosis and treatment process. Integrated treatment approaches that address all co-occurring disorders are essential for effective management. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective for OCD and can also help with other anxiety disorders. Medications like SSRIs can be beneficial for both OCD and generalized anxiety. For more information on managing co-occurring anxiety disorders, you can explore my Quora Profile.",OCD
823,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",OCD
824,"Considering OCD as a form of fear the approach would be to gradually introduce the feared situation for extended periods so the child get used to the situation - this is called graduated exposure. One can also pair the feared situation with something the child finds very positive, e.g. a supportive parent playing with them and encouraging with pleasant activities.
Studies in neuroscience have identified that accessing positive emotion at the same time as facing a fear enhances the processing of fear (ie positive emotion inhibits negative emotion).
To give a practical example of a phobia/fear reaction. My daughter as an baby suddenly became fearful of bath bubbles whilst bathing her (I related this to her skin problems when a baby) and we dealt with this by continuing to bathe her ie not suddenly taking her out of the situation (escape) but extending the bathing period whilst playing with her until she was less fearful. A few sessions of this plus minimal bubbles at first got rid of the problem completely.",OCD

826,"I have gone through the anxiety and depersonalization disorder and overcame successfully….
METHODS I USED TO OVERCOME :
From my experience i can tell you clearly and directly these type of disorders are the results of wrong thinking or overthinking , wrong lifestyle,“narrow perception of REALITY”, or you can say wrong believe system ,and these things took me to these disorders , i worked on my “believe system” and “lifestyle” and it is kind of “reprogramming or updating the previous software of mind” .
• First of all if you have a panic attack then 1000% you are not going to die .
• Hyperventilation : With anxiety disorder that choking feeling you got , you only got that feeling because you take breath very short, take consciously deep breathes, first the breath should go in your diaphragm and then into lungs , in this way the body will return to the right pattern of breathing.
• Now getting rid of depression , “DO MEDITATION DAILY” AT MORNING, i started doing meditation with “headspace app” after ten days of doing meditation with “headspace app” you can do it easily by yourself without app, if you can do meditation daily no stress can even touch you .
• EXERCISE daily at morning, well i am not a gym freak , i do not go to gym, i do it at home after doing meditation , take break for 15 minutes and thanks to the Universe , thanks for the resources you have , thanks the universe to giving you a right direction , thanks for everything , see the sun thank the sun , PRACTICING GRATITUDE is very important ,
and radically FORGIVE EVERYONE , after doing that do push-ups but do it more than 10 and every day increase the limit , do 10 squats , go for running everyday , exercise is very important for recovery it makes brain and body healthy .
• DIET : Avoid junk food , and DO NOT SMOKE PLEASE! the smoking addiction was hard to tackle , do not fall into any addicition that will wrose the recovery , drink juice , eat fresh fruits , DRINK 7 GLASS OF WATER DAILY NO MATTER WHAT ,
“ have good diet to win this fight” ,
eat almonds , dry fruits , whatever that “fruit” is eat it .
Now with a pen and paper plan the next day accordingly and follow through , to wake up early morning i use Mel Robbin’s 5 sec rule , when alarm rings i visualize in mind rocket is launching and countdown has started and start counting backwards 5 4 3 2 1 and WAKE-UP rocket launched , and
“if you wanna change yourself , start off by making your bed in the morning” so clean-up your bed this is your first task and go complete other tasks .
Drink a glass of water , look in mirror ,smile , say “ i am who i have been looking for” with great feel , wash the face , and go follow the routine you have made . Be mentally strong enough to follow the routine , start will be difficult and if you keep following you will adapt in few days.
Read books as much as you can , be a learner , consider your past as a “school” which taught you many great lessons of life , learn from your personal experience from your mistakes , failures and success , from others experience from their failures and success , listen to highly successful people .
Its all about “Mindset”",OCD
827,I don't know how old your child is but my daughter has OCD my daughter a young teen I give her vitamin B1 it really helps. She has had OCD since 9 yrs old. I had OCD since I was 15. Thank God for vitamins.,OCD
828,"First, make absolutely sure, with a professional evaluation, that OCD is really the problem. Then, that pro can give you ideas for how it can be managed or changed without further professional intervention. Do NOT EVER try changing that child’s behavior through threat or punishment. THAT would be very harmful!!",OCD
829,"Practice non - responsive therapy , i.e you have to ignore the compulsion of your brain no matter how difficult it is, initially it would make you numb,your head feeling dizzy ,the brain not being able to process properly,but as time passes by you will master this when this demon in your head will get weaker and your thinking getting clear and a day will come when that demon would make you feel its presence rarely and YES YOU GET THAT RIGHT YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY CURED. THERE IS A SMALL REQUIREMENT U NEED A QUITE AMOUNT OF DETERMINATION U HAVE TO REMAIN MOTIVATED BCZ IT WONT HAPPEN IN A DAY OR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT WITHIN A WEEK U CAN FEEL THE DIFFERENCE, DO A LOT OF CARDIO EXERCISE LIKE JOGGING,SKIPPING,ETC IT HELPS TO CLEAR YOUR FOGGY MIND.
THIS IS MY PERSONAL ADVICE U CAN TAKE MEDICATION THEY HELP TO REDUCE THE VICIOUS CYCLE OF THOSE REPETITIVE THOUGHTS ALONG WITH THE ABOVE SAID THERAPY.
THEN
U WIN THIS BATTLE WITH OCD YOU WILL EMERGE REALLY STRONG AND POWERFUL.
GOODLUCK",OCD
830,"Here are a few things that have helped me:
No marijuana or any other psychoactive substance.
Minimize caffeine intake. This one is tough because caffeine does help me focus, so I keep it to a minimum and follow it up with water, which leads to
Stay hydrated.
Choose food wisely. Eat small meals at a time. Chew each at least some bites mindfully, and thoroughly, thinking about where that food came.
Go for walks, in nature, and don’t bring my phone. I have a watch for the time.
There are other things I do to take care of my physical being, like meditation and stretching, that when they are part of my daily rituals, I do even better.
tl;dr (for the rest of this): I monitor my thoughts, and choose to discontinue thoughts I deem unhelpful or contrary to my values.
Treating my physical body with love and respect is important and helpful, but the cognitive work I have done has provided the most relief. I spent many years thinking that external circumstances caused my anxiety. I did my best to avoid any situation that I deemed stressful. I rarely went to restaurants, concerts, or generally any social setting where I had to interact and negotiate with anybody, or where there were too many rules. As I got older, I got better at managing life (due greatly to the influence of my first wife), and I began to slowly recognize that I was feeling anxious even when my circumstances weren’t particularly stressful. Then one day, I had a particularly catalyzing event that made this truth undeniable, that my anxiety might be triggered by some external event, but the actual experience was some sort of chemical imbalance within me.
I was going to a festival with my daughter to deliver some supplies to a friend, and in exchange I would get in for free. The whole trip, everything was going perfectly. We were perhaps going to be 10 to 15 minutes later than I said, but the supplies weren’t need until later anyways. Traffic was perfect. We hadn’t forgotten anything. We had enough money to be comfortable. On the drive I began feeling intensely anxious. I kept looking for reasons why. Parking was going to be horrible because we were getting there late. At the time we were arriving, we’d probably have a 15 minute walk from the car in the heat. But we could drop the supplies at the gate no problem, then park. Did I remember what to bring? Yes I had everything. As we passed the volunteer parking lot right next to the entrance, the person at the gate recognized my daughter, called out her name, and waved us into a parking spot. We had gate side parking, in the shade, free passes, plenty of money, time with my daughter, friends, great music, a place to camp, all at one of my favorite festivals (because it’s small but exciting). I couldn’t find a single external reason to blame for feeling anxious. I had to accept that my anxiety is a state of being not dependent on circumstances. I had to accept that there is something wrong with me. That acceptance has made it much easier to make progress. Life is just life. I’m the one freaking out. This set the stage for the next step in reducing the impact of anxiety attacks on my life.
When I had to accept that external events were not causing my anxiety, and in fact were triggering them less and less as I got older and gained experience, I became more willing and able to examine my thought patterns. I love to let my mind wander. I love to fantasize. I write songs and stories and skits, and the wandering mind is a part of my creative process. One day, in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, I was driving along, fantasizing about how I could blow up the Goldman Sachs building. I was dreaming up ways of I could make it happen and maybe even get away with it. I noticed what I was thinking, and another part of myself asked out loud, do I really want to be thinking about that? It goes so completely contrary to my core values. I’m a pacifist. I don’t want to hurt anybody, even if they theoretically deserve it, which they almost never do. Why am I thinking about this? I could have made up the excuse that I was just fantasizing a plot line for yet another story I won’t write. What I really was doing was feeling powerless about the international financial crisis, and the fantasizing was a coping mechanism. I was also aware of how anxious I was feeling. The anxiety was causing me to latch on to the crisis as an excuse for what I was experiencing. I was driving too fast. I was twitchy and sketchy, fast breathing, things I experience when I’m anxious. The crisis wasn’t affecting me. I’m poor. I have no investments. I live in a poor county. I was almost completely unaffected by the financial crisis. Nothing much in my life changed. I was looking for an excuse as to why I was anxious, and the thoughts were adding to my anxiety, in a feedback loop.
So I started thinking about positive things, things were going good in my life, things I could do something about, and lo and behold, my anxiety lessened. It didn’t go away completely, it just had less influence over me. So that day, I made an agreement with myself. I’m going to start monitoring my own thoughts, and regularly ask myself, do I really want to be thinking about this? If the answer was yes, then think away. But if the answer was no, then think about something else. Typically, I would sing a song in my mind as a transition, then turn my thoughts towards something positive. It took me a couple of years to get good at it.
I still have panic attacks. I still am reluctant to put myself into certain situations even though it would benefit me. I avoid tasks that can trigger my anxiety, because it sucks. It feels awful. I hate it. But when it does happen, I know that it is a chemical, or perhaps electrical, imbalance within me. It’s as if I’m on a drug, and I will come down. I just have to ride it out, and meanwhile, think about things I like to think about. Think about things I have control over. I almost never take meds anymore. Only when it’s really bad and I have to function.",OCD
831,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
832,"If they really have OCD and are not just wild ordinary kids being kids, then I suggest you speak to a therapist who specializes in OCD.
I also recommend the book titled “when a family member has OCD”, which is available on Amazon.com",OCD
833,"Treatment for OCD in kids/teenagers is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In therapy, kids/teenagers learn coping and calming skills for anxiety. They learn how to safely face fears without doing rituals.
Along with therapy, doctors may give medicines for OCD to some kids. For kids who need medicines, doctors give SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). These include Zoloft®, Prozac®, and Luvox®.
Treatment works best when a parent or caregiver goes to therapy with their child. That way, they can learn how to coach their child through OCD symptoms, help their child practice skills they learn in therapy, and offer daily support.

834,"Postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the newer disorders that is part of the postpartum mood disorders group. It is estimated that about 3-5% of postpartum women will experience some of the symptoms of Postpartum OCD.
The following are a part of the common obsessions mothers with postpartum OCD will experience:
Undesirable pictures of harming the child, for example, dropping or tossing him/her
Intrusive and unwanted thoughts of suffocation or stabbing the baby
Scared of making poor decisions that will cause the baby harm or death
Fear of exposing the baby to toxins and chemicals and other environmental pollutants
It’s important to note that mothers who suffer from postpartum OCD are hyper-vigilant and sensitive to anything related to child abuse, whether physical, sexual, or otherwise.
The following are a part of the common compulsions experienced by those with postpartum OCD:
Not feeding the baby out of fear of poisoning him/her.
Not changing diapers out of fear of sexually abusing the baby.
Getting rid of sharp objects such as knives or scissors
Asking family members for reassurance that the baby has not been harmed or abused",OCD
835,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

836,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
837,OCD is an anxiety disorder. Its not a thought disorder. Although people with OCD are tormented by intrusive and unwanted thoughts its not the thought that is the problem. What happens is the anxiety producing part of thd brain is malfunctioning. It's mistakenly marrying up certain thoughts as a threat to your safety. The thoughts could be just about anything. The anxiety response to these thoughts compells the sufferer to try and solve the question of why they are having these these thoughts which leads to hours of daily ruminations. In an attempt to quell the anxiety and the need to solve why this id happening the sufferer will partake in all kinds if relief seeking rituals such as going to great lengths in avoiding anything that may trigger anxiety from these thoughts. They seek reassurances from others that they are okay and not insane. There are numerous ways they attemp to escape and find relief thought these ritualistic behaviors and rumination. Their goal is to rid themselves of these troubling thoughts however all these attempts to solve it backires with even more anxiety spiked or warnings that they are in some kind of danger. Because its an anxiety disorder all these attempts to seek safety or relief teach the anxiety producing part of their brain the amygdala that these thoughts are so important and unacceptable. It reinforces the amygdala that it is correct in sending out these anxiety spikes and the condition predictably worsens. Treatment for OCD is CBT therapy along with ERP which is Exposure anf response prevention. The therapy is designed to habituate the amygdala to the irrational fears by exposing it on purpose to the very thoughts that bother them so much. All attempts to quell the anxiety by ruminating or performing ritualistic behaviors are to be stopped. This turns the table on the OCD and teaches the amygdala that they are not in danger from these thoughts and in fact welcome them. Over time the amygdala will habituate to these thoughts and stop sending out spikes of anxiety from them. The thoughts them predictably recede. There are various OCD themes and subtypes but in the end they are all caused by an anxiety disorder and are all just bullshit that can be unwound with proper therapy.,OCD

Bp level will be difference.. But why?
Because our subconscious mind like memories system know the consequences of war..

Your all cells of body depends on the consciousness feeling..

839,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.
OCD is a mental condition that is linked with obsessive thoughts and behavior. Obsession, in this case, is highly unpleasant as the individual is compelled to repeat certain behavior again and again (such as washing their hands to avoid catching germs). This is to avoid their obsession turning into reality. The condition is anxiety-related and the thoughts are unwanted and intrusive. Sufferers often understand that these thoughts are irrational, but by performing compulsive behavior, they believe they will be cured or will be relieved.
Obsessive compulsive disorder can be categorized into 4 types:
Checking
Contamination
Hoarding
Intrusive Thoughts

840,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",OCD
841,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
842,"It can be completely debilitating. This guy that I almost dated (we decided against it because we both had serious issues that we needed to sort out individually) had very severe OCD. He was scared of chemicals and couldn't interact with things that he didn't 100% know were ""sanitary"". He struggled to sit down at restaurants, buy things at stores, do his laundry at laundry mats, and when he was in an institution to receive help, he struggled to use the shower or even shave (I didn't mind the beard though haha). I helped him probably a bit more than I should have because I really liked him and cared for him. I'd help him go shopping and do his laundry and stuff. That's part of the reason we decided not to pursue anything as a couple. It was too hard for me not to enable him.
He was also completely unable to touch other people. This means no sexual contact or even hugs. That might just seem sexually frustrating, and he told me it was, but not having any human contact for years on end isn't emotionally healthy at all. It can be really isolating and often (understandably) ruined his relationships.
Of course, it exists on a spectrum and he was on an extreme end of it. Most people with OCD aren't that disabled, but regardless, it's a very painful and difficult illness.",OCD
843,"In my case, I was running through a series of numbers in my head & then I'd do the same thing backwards. And as I counted away numbers obsessively inside my head.

I was also attaching bad thoughts if I wasn't able to do it right ! I was always in a manic frame of mind. Id displayed OCD traits as early as 11. The fully suppressed emotions of years & years of abuse. With no way of ending the abuse. And unable to release my emotions.

It could be random intrusive thoughts towards which you have no emotional connection, it could be cleaning out of irrational fear of contracting a disease that was wiped out 200 years ago, or it could be unconsciously biting your nails until they bleed for no apparent reason.
Psychopaths make up a very large group of different people, and OCD is a very expansive group of diagnoses. It is very possible for these to be comorbid.",OCD
845,"Yes psychopaths are completely capable of having OCD as it is a separate condition that does not interfere with the wiring of psychopathy. OCD is not reliant on anxiety either if that is what you were wondering, OCD can cause anxiety but anxiety does not cause OCD. As psychopaths do not suffer from anxiety OCD does not cause anxiety for us.",OCD
846,"Psychopaths endure a distinct and profound form of suffering: chronic, pathological boredom.
This isn't the fleeting boredom experienced by neurotypical individuals during moments of inactivity.
Instead, it manifests as an unfillable void, a pervasive condition that persists regardless of what they do or acquire.
Unlike typical boredom, which arises from a lack of stimuli, psychopathic boredom is relentless and insatiable.
For them, even moments of intense sensation-seeking provide only temporary relief, dissipating as quickly as they arise.
Consequently, psychopaths are in a perpetual search for stimulation, seizing upon any opportunity for diversion in a desperate attempt to escape the torment of their boredom.
While obsessive-compulsive tendencies might irritate them, they don't elicit the same profound suffering as boredom does.
Indeed, for psychopaths, boredom is an unparalleled agony, an affliction that defies adequate description.",OCD
847,Yes. They do not necessarily contradict each as far as I know. Severe OCD seems unlikely but may present some interesting features.,OCD
848,"Yes, I have ocd. I think it was most likely caused by experiences in my childhood, my brother would take my things, headphones pens and other objects. He always broke them, it caused me extreme stress.
It has developed into obsessively organizing and guarding a stash of charging cables. I panic if I can’t find something, even something as simple as a sock.",OCD
849,"Yes we can. I do.
I have a mild version of OCD. My grandfather had OCD that was all-consuming. He would turn doorknobs until “it felt right”, etc He had a mental/personality disorder too, but I didn't know him we enough to figure out what he might have had. He was severely physically abusive towards my father & aunts, according to the stories I've heard. The abuse turned my father into a low functioning sociopath. (I'm a HFS).",OCD
850,"Personality disorders, including psychopathy and obsessive compulsive disorder tend to be inflexible and are pervasive across many situations which serves to keep the individual ego-syntonic, in other words are consistent with the behavior patterns of the individual and are, therefore appropriate for them.
The behavior can lead to maladaptive coping skills including personal problems such as depression and extreme anxiety seen in behaviors such as obsessive compulsive behavior, usually beginning in adolescence and having negative consequences on the quality of life. The overlapping of mental disorder traits seen in personality disorders is not uncommon when classifying issues surrounding nomenclature.

851,"Yes. OCD is where you have an obsession (let’s say germs) and feel compelled to perform a ritual (hand washing) in a particular way that relieves the anxiety that the obsession creates. Anti -social personality disorder is a person who does not consider or (sometimes) care about the impact their actions have on others, as long as their actions get them what they want. Sociopaths differ from psychopaths because sociopaths are “created” by their maladaptive environment, and psychopaths are born with the inability to experience empathy and emotion like others do. Anti-social personality disorder doesn’t exclude the possibility of OCD, and vice versa.",OCD
852,Yep. They usually have some cormorbidity with ASPD. They're all different. They don't just have ASPD in many cases. ASPD can usually be easier to manage once other disorders or addiction treatments or meds are addressed. Once you treat the individual for other problems the behavioral stuff is managed:),OCD
853,"Yes,
obsession is an entirely separate neurological phenomenon from psychopathy. Psychopathy is a disorder associated with oxytocin and the empathy system; and obsession is associated with low central serotonin. For incarcerated psychopaths obsession related behaviour such as stalking are common.",OCD
854,"Since I have no concept of the difference I am going to steal 93% of my answer from here:
""So today, let’s look at 5 important differences between OCPD and OCD:
Difference #1: Insight
Folks with OCD usually know that their thoughts are not exactly reasonable (“Did I turn off the stove? I’d better check,” or “If I wear unmatched socks, something bad will happen to my brother.”)
By contrast, individuals with OCPD believe their sky-high standards and work ethic are not only reasonable, but the only way to get things done.
Difference #2: Distress
In OCD, the obsessions and compulsions are stressful and unpleasant. For instance, feeling convinced you just drove over someone and circling back dozens of times to check for a body turns one’s stomach into knots. By contrast, for those with OCPD, the rigid schedules and rules of the condition are often comforting and feel right.
Difference #3: Guilt
In OCD, individuals can, but not always, feel guilty about asking others to conform to their rituals (for example, “I know it’s a hassle to put on shoe covers whenever you come inside, but I really, really need you to do that. I’m so sorry.”) On the flip side, those with OCPD think others should conform to their methods and firmly believe they’d be better off for it.
Difference #4: Anxiety
With OCD, compulsions - the actions someone with OCD can’t resist doing, like checking, counting, or washing - are performed to reduce anxiety. For instance, an individual with OCD might review her schedule for the day over and over again because she’s terrified she’s forgotten to include all her appointments.
By contrast, someone with OCPD might make and review a detailed schedule in order to be comprehensive and efficient. Anxiety isn’t part of the picture.
Difference #5: Time
By definition, OCD takes more than an hour a day. That’s right - part of an OCD diagnosis can be the fact that the obsessions, plus the compulsions to neutralize the obsessions, suck up a lot of time. OCPD, on the other hand, is more tightly interwoven to one’s personality. Rather than being an activity unto itself, the perfectionism and control of OCPD is more of a trait, not a time suck. OCD vs. OCPD: 5 Differences

I have been jokingly referred to several times by acquaintances of being ""Monk- The obsessive compulsive detective"" Adrian Monk because of my method of analyzing complex problems we 'nerds' like to throw at each other. Nope. But I liked the show when I saw it and it was one of the few tv shows I would make an attempt to see. Sort of like Gotham these days.",OCD
855,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",OCD
856,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
857,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
858,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
859,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

860,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD

862,"For me the key to recovery was learning to label my intrusive thoughts, feelings and sensations. No matter how real they feel I just tell myself, ""Nope. This is an OCD thing and I know how this ends."" I do not push the thoughts away...I simply choose not to waste anymore than 2 seconds trying to figure them out.(Why am I having this thought? What does this mean? What does this say about me? Could it be true? What if? What if? What if?). Historically, me trying to answer these questions have in no way provided me with any kind of long term relief. Short term? Yes. Long term. Never. I simply choose not to engage. I observe the thought, feeling or sensation. I label it as OCD then I refocus on more important things. By the way...literally anything is more important than engaging with your OCD. As time goes on you start to see the change. Before you know it, days will have gone by and you'll think, ""Wow! I haven't thought about XYZ in a minute"", and you'll slowly start becoming more productive, stress free, and engaged. You just have to trust the process and STICK WITH IT. You may still have the thoughts, and depending on a particular obsessions impact on your life...you'll likely have them until the day you die. But you'll no longer find them distressing in the way that they use to be, and your perspective regarding them will have vastly changed...I am in OCD remission, and my life is amazing.",OCD
863,"Both sound the same but there are two different disorders falling under two different category.
Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is a Cluster C personality disorder, while obsessive compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder.
Personality disorders are “enduring, patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts”, and “are inflexible and maladaptive, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress”. While Anxiety disorder are “disorders that share features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat.”
With this I hope you get to know they fall under two different categories of mental disorders.
The criteria for each does differ a lot. (Check out the footnotes for further reference).
Further differences between these two disorders are
OCPD and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are two distinct conditions even though there is some overlap.
OCD patients have insight, while people with OCPD do not.
In OCD they view their thoughts as abnormal, unwanted and distressing. In OCPD they view their way of thinking as normal and beneficial.
A person with OCPD may seek out help from a healthcare professional due to interpersonal problems, but not about their way of thinking or acting.
Thus, the main difference between these two is an OCD patient experience anxiety if the compulsive act isn't performed while an OCPD patient doesn't experience any such anxiety.
The etiology also differs from each other. OCD is usually a result of “Thought-action fusion” and other nurture factors, while OCPD is usually a result of nurture, the way of their up bringing.
The success rate of treatment is high in OCD but very low in OCPD.

865,"In a person’s brain, a bell goes off- “did I wash my hand?, I touched my shoes and that could cause an infection”. People have similar thoughts across the board, but in a brain without OCD, it goes to another part of the brain which allows you to calm the alarm center by washing your hands, and you get an all clear signal. In a brain with OCD, there is no all clear signal. The thought bounces back and forth between action and worry, action and worry, action and worry. It’s like a fire alarm going off that you keep trying to shut off with a towel but it keeps blaring no matter what you do. They know their thoughts are irrational, but don’t you hear the alarm blaring?! OCD is now found to be a neurological disorder, not a psychological one. On a brain scan, it can clearly be seen.
How do you stop the compulsions? Generally a mixture of medication (to calm the thoughts) and cognitive behavioral therapy is used. It’s not easy by any means but the general idea is to hold oneself back from acting on the compulsions. Eventually the alarm will stop blaring and the anxiety around it will calm down. There’s no cure but it can be managed, with help from a professional and compassion from those around you.
If you want to understand it further, I can explain the exact mechanism that is going on in the brain, specifically the basal ganglia. I would also suggest two books that explain really well what it is like living with OCD, Kissing Doorknobs and Turtles All the Way Down, the new John Green book (he has OCD).",OCD
866,"OCD compulsions are in response to a trigger. If you are not compulsively cleaning or whatever in response to something (usually an irrational something) that triggered you it is most likely not OCD.
Even if you are an excessive daily groomer that is 2 standard deviations from the norm that does not make you OCD if it is not in response to a trigger.",OCD
867,"I’ve had diagnosed OCD since age 8. I never think of them as rituals. “Compulsions” is a phrase nearer the mark, but I would actually say that I experience them as gaps in short-term memory.
Let me explain.
One of my issues is handwashing. I worry that my hands are not clean enough, free of germs or chemicals, to cook or to handle a baby. I wash them. Then as I turn away from the sink, I stop because I can’t remember if I actually washed them, or just intended to.
Have you ever meant to take a pill or something and can’t remember if you actually did it or just meant to? Similarly, the lack of memory of handwashing vexes me to the point I feel like I have to wash them again just to be sure. I wash them again. Then I turn to whatever it was I was planning to cook. Did I wash my hands?
Half of the problem comes from going on autopilot while I’m handwashing, I think. I don’t think about what I’m doing, so I’ve got no memory of it. I try to combat this with scented soaps so that I can sniff-test my skin. But what if the scent is lingering from earlier? What if I’ve touched something since?
I touch the countertop and can’t remember if I sanitized it recently. What if an egg had touched it? What if raw meat has touched it? What about dirt or chemicals from produce? What about snail-borne brain-eating amoebas? I’d better sanitize it again to make sure. The wet dish cloth bothers me. What else has it touched? Better wash my hands.
This is how my day goes. My hands are rough and red. In the winter they swell, crack and throb. It gets worse when I feel stressed or out of control.
I have other manifestations, but handwashing is the bad one. I don’t necessarily feel like I have to perform a handwashing ritual to stave off disaster, but that I try to remember having completed a healthy, one-time wash and can’t, so I have to do it again and again.",OCD
868,"I am writing this to your wife, hence the “you” term. I also have cleaning OCD + number and repetitive OCD.
First, if you live in a country where private healthcare is very expensive and the waiting lists for referred psychologists are too long, you should go to a open source like Planned Parent Hood or an organization specializing in anxiety disorders and compulsive behaviors/ psychological problems. Because if you do try to overcome this alone, you will relapse multiple times resulting in a worse relapse every time. I can speak on behalf of my self and thousands of other people with OCD or compulsive behavior.
Second you should make a private list of your goals and then work it out together with your appointed doctor. The list should include:
Why do I want this?
Who am I doing it for? (The answer should ALWAYS be yourself, but you have to mean it a 100%)
A week by week plan like i want to have achieved this by then and then. But be realistic. If you are not, the feelings when you relapse will be worse, and let’s be honest. You will relapse. Compulsive behavior is like a self created drug. You do it to relive anxiety, stress and tension your body creates to alleviate something much deeper like fear for something only you can truly understand.
Figure out the root of your problems. Were you bullied? Do you feel less superior? Less worth? Ask yourself the important questions like do I know why this onset came? Were there a particularly traumatic event in my life? (If so. you may need additional counseling to get all sides of the problem) What do I get bothered by? What are my triggers? Write these down and share them with your appointed doctor to make a chart so you can trace and flag your behavior. This way you are one step in front of your own self destructive behavior.
Set a limit of how much time you are allowed to use on your rituals or ruminating. If your compulsions are washing, then set an amount of overall time for the day, or per hand wash, how many rounds of laundry you are allowed per. week, etc. If your compulsions are organizing and panning, set a max. amount of time you are allowed to do so everyday. For ruminating compulsions, experts actually encourages to set aside one hour each day where you sit all by yourself without any distractions and think about all the things you try so hard to block out. Ask yourself the questions that get uncomfortable, accept and invite the feelings and let yourself answer them. Sit there til your skin stop crawling and move on to the next thought.
Try to notice your urges and compulsion before they take over and lead you on bad roads.
As an answer to the tip above, lay out a different amount of activities that you wholeheartedly enjoy doing, and keep them close by so that when in need, you can occupy yourself with such. It can be anything from knitting, sewing, playing a game, going out for a run, putting on your favorite TV show box set etc. Find something that entertains you and be realy strict with yourself. If the urge arises, place your butt in the nearest sitting space and hobby away. The urge will subside if you just keep riding it out. It’s like that with every “high” you get. It will eventually fade into a little murmur. And it’s much easier to ignore a murmur than a alarming shouting feeling in your body
Have a strong network of friends and family around you. You’ve already made the first step in admitting your problem, so applause to you! I am already so proud of you. Now you must tell someone you really trust, if not more people, so that that person can be your rock when in need. Like a personal jar of kind words. Because you will have bad days, and you will need someone to talk to. I am basically doing this myself, and I miss someone to talk to. Even if it’s just to let everything out or just cry for 30 seconds without anyone judging my compulsions.
If you fall, get back up. If you fall again, get back up. If you fall a third time, find better shoes. You will see this through, and you will make a better life for yourself. I honestly believe that. I have to believe that, because I am right in this mess myself. You will relapse, but you will not end up at your starting point. Every step you take is forward. The relapse you experience is just a very strong wind.
Last but not least, don’t be afraid to go out or confront your obsessions and fears. One of the things your counselor will ask you to do is to seek out the things that scare you or makes your head scream and stand in the moment until the pain subsides. This proves to yourself that you are capable of restraining yourself. You have free will, and you will conquer. This is called Exposure Therapy. Face your fears, and prove yourself right.

Finally, I want to end this with saying: You are not your compulsions. You are a strong human being. You can and you will do this, because you deserve a beautiful life and everything you have to offer. You don’t deserve to be a prisoner of your own illness. If there’s anything that exposure therapy has proven me, it’s that the fear/anxiety/urges and whatnot’s that comes out of not doing my compulsions, is that it always goes away after about 30–45 seconds. The most extreme part of a panic attack subsides after 15 minutes. It is not humanly possible to be at the top at the curve of a panic attack for more than 15 minutes. It may still be uncomfortable. But your worst panic symptoms will always fade after 15 minutes. You will never die off an anxiety or panic attack. And every time you reach the top of the curve, the top is further down then it was the last time you were at the top of your curve. And eventually the top of the curve will be like any other “Uh oh or hell no’s” you experience with other things that makes you feel iffy. Everyone has OCD to some extend, but they usually forget about the intrusive thought and go about their normal lives. You will finally reach this target if you work hard enough. Accept your fears. Don’t work against them, but also don’t allow them to happen. Tell yourself that it’s ok to fell this way. That this isn’t you, but it still makes you afraid, and that is okay. Everyone is afraid of something, and this, right here, right now, is making you scared or anxious. The sooner you accept this, the easier and faster you will learn to overcome it. It’s much easier to get out of a hell house if you’ve accepted that there’s a rabid serial killer trying to kill you. you will remain level headed, you will not freak out and you will find solutions to your problems. And finally, there you found the exit. On to the next problem.
So come on, let your beautiful self be able to control you!

It’s not something that is taken lightly. The actual disorder is difficult for people to actually live with.
It’s a stereotype that “cleanliness” is OCD but in reality it can and can’t be.
A real case of OCD would be someone who has to push their doorbell twice and take three steps to walk inside all the time and never make a mistake or they’ll have to redo it.
Another example is organization. A person with OCD may need to organize their kitchen so that the forks are 2–4 inches away from the knives and the 3–6 inches away from the knives. Or the colors of the dishes and the sizes are neatly placed consistently and to their liking.
There is a problem with self diagnosing and that most of the time it is false but to give you the benefit of the doubt, you can have it.
Please do more research about mental disorders before diagnosing yourself. You can say you have something just by the symptoms but you should really watch people’s perspectives who actually have those disorders as it is a good learning experience.",OCD
871,"Normal compulsion cleaning behavior refers to a tendency to keep one's surroundings clean and tidy as a matter of personal preference or habit. True OCD cleaning behavior, on the other hand, is characterized by excessive cleaning and grooming rituals that are driven by intense anxiety or fear and take up excessive amounts of time, interfering with daily life. These compulsions are often irrational or excessive, and the person may feel compelled to perform them despite not wanting to. Additionally, true OCD cleaning behavior can be distressing and cause significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

872,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD

So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
874,"The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD[1]) is not well understood, but it is believed to be due to a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Some of the possible causes of OCD include:
Genetics: Studies have shown that OCD tends to run in families, suggesting that there may be a genetic component to the disorder.
Brain structure and function: Abnormalities in certain areas of the brain and imbalances in neurotransmitters (such as serotonin) have been implicated in the development of OCD.
Environmental factors: Traumatic or stressful life events, such as abuse or neglect, can trigger OCD symptoms or make them worse.
Infections: Some studies have suggested a link between certain infections and the development of OCD symptoms.
It's important to note that the causes of OCD can vary from person to person and that there is no single cause for the disorder. The best way to understand the causes of OCD is to talk to a mental health professional who can assess your symptoms and provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.

A disease?
No.
Then, how can it be cured?
Dude, it's a thought process. It's a monkey in your mind. I don't want to talk about medication or such stuff unless you're diagnosed with chronic OCD.
All I say is ignore every thought that is meaningless. For suppose, you just want to touch a cup in a certain way. Don't do it. Just don't do it. It feels terrible restraining. But hold on. Tell your mind the actual logic. You feel like it's not gonna work. Let it be until one day, you will smile and say to yourself, “That little bitch (obsession)!!”

876,"Like any mental disturbance, OCD can be mild, moderate, or severe, or any place in between. Each person is different. Symptoms do tend to increase with intensity and frequency under stress.
OCD is a form of anxiety disorder which uses repetitive, ritualistic behavior in order to bind anxiety. This actually works to a certain extent, but always with diminishing returns. Its sort of like a person at a slot machine. They may get a pay out once in a while, but most of the time they lose. The fact that they’ve been paid off at all gives them the drive to keep seeking that pay off again.
Hence the compulsive nature of OCD. An untreated OCD person can look something like a person stuck on a slot machine, only they are stuck doing their own rituals.
OCD is very treatable, although results, as with any mental disorder, are not always immediate. Both medication and talk therapies are recommended.",OCD
877,"Whether any disease can be cured or not…. No body can guarantee but this doesn't mean that we don't try.
I have seen personally cases of chronic ocd cured totally. The main significant thing, as rightly pointed by some is a combination of medicine n psychotherapy. It is really frustrating to have ocd but it is manageable. You just got to remember YOU ARE NOT OCD, YOU ARE A PERSON WHO HAS Ocd, just like any other disease. Combat it to your best…. It is an everyday struggle I agree but every small victory(meang when u don't get into the ritual of ur compulsions) is an inch towards being Ocd free.",OCD
878,"OCD, like many psychiatric or physical illness can be on a continuum,from very mild to crippling. Yes—it can be serious. Some people are unable to work effectively, leave their home, or take care of basic needs they are so wrapped up in their obsessions and delusions. A shower may take hours because of rituals involved. Washing the dishes may take hours Your garage may be full of garbage bags of tissues you have used to wipe things of feared contamination. Driving may require following certain routes with certain rituals—or one has to start over. Depression, shame, thoughts of suicide are not uncommon in severe OCD. Loss of job, dropping out of school, loss of relationships—all can be common in severe OCD.
Left untreated, OCD may continue for years—in many cases getting steadily worse over time. In some it will stay stable. We do not generally talk about cure—we speak of control. We can “turn down the volume,” like turning down a radio to a whisper i many people. Some people are cured. Medication can be helpful for many. Behavior therapy is useful for most.",OCD
879,"Hello there, I have written about this topic before so feel free to scroll and read. In the meantime, a few points to consider.
OCD can seriously disrupt your quality of life if there are other comorbid conditions you cannot manage it and delay seeking therapy and support it will and can have a serious detrimental effect.
The treatment usually based on psycho dynamic behaviour therapy, CBT DBT and or alongside counselling, and medication for chronic or acute complex cases can help enormously THOUGH…
Outcome depends on the individual circumstances may need a long period to recuperate fully, if at all. But you need to be ready, mentally,and emotional toting itboff follow the programe fully to cope with the hard work ahead but usually it's very beneficial.
Needless to say the longer one leaves OCD - or bury one’s head in the sand putting it off, the deeper worse and longer it will take to address and find a solution. Indeed OCD if coupled with anxiety and other mental health pressures can cause all kinds of problems, meltdowns and isolation long term as one example. So it makes sense to seek treatment as soon as possible.
Hope this helps. Kind regards",OCD
880,"The issue is whether the OCD is causing difficulties for you and/or your family. If it is, you have to decide whether it is enough of a problem to seek treatment.
OCD tends to wax and wane depending on stress level. Some people can learn to deal with it on their own—eg, “I used to be a neatnik, but when the twins came I realized I had to let go of that—now I am happy if I can get the clothes out of the dryer.",OCD
881,"It gets to the point where you can’t function normally in daily life. I have OCD and for the longest time I didn’t believe in taking medication for my mental illness but it got bad enough that I went and got a prescription for it and I’m glad that I did. I feel the pain for a person with untreated OCD, it is very hard to go through and I feel for them. Some people would say that untreated OCD patients go crazy in a way if it’s left untreated and I wouldn’t doubt it because it is truly a living hell.",OCD
882,"Okay so first off i would consider it pretty serious, it can be very hard to cope with and can interrupt your daily life including school, work, and even just relaxing at home. For some people it can get as bad as not being able to leave the house because it’s too dirty and they genuinely can’t handle it.
OCD is not curable, it can be treated with medication and/or therapy but there is no known cure.
If OCD if left untreated it can become worse and worse, it can become completely controlling over your life where you can’t even have a job or go to school or live a normal life. it’ll take time to get to that point but if left untreated for a long time that’s what it’ll lead too. it can just completely consume your life.",OCD
883,"Depends on the severity. OCD can be very serious. It's difficult to ‘cure’ but it can be treated and managed. My OCD only reappears when I'm worried about something now it is under control.

885,"I don't think OCD has any correlation with the country you live in or maybe the lifestyle can cause it but there is no conclusive evidence about it.
The only reason I think USA has more cases of OCD or any other mental illness is because mental illness is considered like any other illness and is taken seriously.
Whereas ,in eastern countries even if you have some psychological problems,you can not share it with others openly. Mental illness is considered as taboo.If you talk about it with others then they would consider you crazy or mad and stay away from you. So, most individuals prefer not to reveal the problem and deal with it on their own. It would clearly keep the data of patients low for that country .
And trust me its really difficult to deal with psychological problems where I am from as even some of the psychologist don't really believe the patients .Most of them are callous and insensitive towards your problems.",OCD

So I shall add a few words about how drug companies are running the health system in the US into the ground for profits. I hope you knew that, as it really is the truth, besides being the entire basis for my answer. ANd it answers ALL of those ""why are [this group of different'y-abled persons] so much more prevalent in the USA, it's always because drug companies make $$ selling ""sick"" people pills. And because ""healthy"" people don't buy as many pills, they feel a need to increase their profits by making everybody think they are ""sick"" somehow, when the only thing wrong with them is that they are a unique human, and they were born in America, the Land of Corporate welfare and profits over people.",OCD

890,"OCD is an anxiety disorder where you experience debilitating obsessions and/or compulsions.
Obsessions are thoughts, images, or ideas which won't go away, are unwanted, and which cause major distress. If you have OCD, it is common to have one or more obsessions linked to repeated doubts, a need for order, contamination by germs, or aggressive or disturbing ideas, as well as sexual and religious images.
Compulsions are behaviors that you feel you have to carry out over and over again to relieve your anxiety. If you have OCD, it is common to have compulsions, mental acts or rituals around cleaning, counting, checking, requesting or demanding reassurance, and ensuring order and symmetry.
However, it is important to remember that having a strange thought or repeating something a couple of times does not necessarily mean that you have OCD.

891,"Are we quick enough is an equally worthy question. We don’t identify very early what might be developing into a disorder. All mood disorders start off as “adjustment disorder”, which is frankly rather silly. Only later do we see if it’s anxiety or depression or both.
I have issues with bipolar disorder as well, but those are incredibly specific.
It was my passion, an interest of mine to try and reform and improve the diagnostic method using the DSM. I wanted to be on the steerage committee for writing the newest amendment. That’s the group changing the part of the field I cared about.
Naturally I have issues with the system as it is. I have ideas to improve it. I have issues with the institution of psychology as it stands today. Passion for reform will do that
However, I have accepted that my reforms are not wanted. I’ve grown a lot in learning that the client has to engage with what you have to offer. I also accepted that I did not want to pay the price it cost to try and get my cause heard, considering the actual chances of getting it heard by the people who could do something with it.
I can’t diagnose what I’m not allowed to examine. There are essential parts that are kept to only those with the credentials to discuss them. I’m not thrilled with the results. I’ve heard that from a lot of ordinary people and professionals.

896,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD

898,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

899,"I recently woke up just to look around the house. I immediately starting putting dishes in the dishwasher. I changed the fish bowl. Then I put my son’s toys away. I started vacuuming. I swept and mopped the kitchen floor. Vacuumed the Living Room. I rearranged the pillows on the couch. Cleaned almost every room in the house. Wiped the kitchen counter…then I made a cup of blueberry herbal tea. I suddenly looked around and felt HAPPY! I think cleaning the house expends negative energy and helps you do things you need to do. It helps you to focus on other things. In a few days I am starting classes at home. I need my house to be neat while I study.
If you are meeting your objectives in life then definitely keep doing what you are doing. It might be obsessive but you are controlling your environment. Maybe it helps you focus on other things afterwards.
If you notice that it is taking up all of your time then maybe do one room a day and that is it. It shouldn’t take up your entire day. You need time to sort things out and relax. If you obsessively clean you could be using it to avoid something. People who clean night and day are subconsciously cleaning up other things in their lives. Look at the big picture. What problem are you avoiding? You need to face the problem head on. I have met people who clean excessively and then live with their boyfriends who are drug dealers. I found that funny in a perverse way. How can you clean the house night and day and ignore something detrimental to your future like that?

900,"For me the key to recovery was learning to label my intrusive thoughts, feelings and sensations. No matter how real they feel I just tell myself, ""Nope.

What does this mean? What does this say about me? Could it be true? What if? What if? What if?). Historically, me trying to answer these questions have in no way provided me with any kind of long term relief. Short term? Yes. Long term. Never. I simply choose not to engage. I observe the thought, feeling or sensation. I label it as OCD then I refocus on more important things. By the way...literally anything is more important than engaging with your OCD. As time goes on you start to see the change. Before you know it, days will have gone by and you'll think, ""Wow! I haven't thought about XYZ in a minute"", and you'll slowly start becoming more productive, stress free, and engaged. You just have to trust the process and STICK WITH IT. You may still have the thoughts, and depending on a particular obsessions impact on your life...you'll likely have them until the day you die. But you'll no longer find them distressing in the way that they use to be, and your perspective regarding them will have vastly changed...I am in OCD remission, and my life is amazing.",OCD

903,"I've been picking my skin since forever and a few years ago I started having severe episodes causing damagement to a great extend. Luckily, my skin is healing pretty great and so far I'm only having a few, almost unnoticeable scars. People who aren't aware of this condition tell you to “just stop“ which makes you feel guilty as if it was something being in your control. It's not!! You don't need to convince others in believing this fact but you surely need to convince yourself!! Otherwise you'll deal with a lot of self-hatred. You need to learn to accept episodes as happenings and distance yourself from the cause. If it happened, it happened. And it will most likely happen again. It's only natural that you don't feel good with fresh wounds and want them to be gone. Care about yourself, try to treat your wounds properly and move on. And don't try to motivate yourself by thinking: “This was the last time!” Rather think: “It will likely happen again. But I'll stick to my treatment and it will get better.” A new episode doesn't mean you failed in working on getting better!! If you're at home, try to cover your skin with a thick layer of some cream that supports the healing process. This will also make it harder for you to search for any “imperfections” and pick on them. What REALLY helps me A LOT is taking acetyl-cystein supplements. Although it's still an off label treatment, studies proving a significant positive effect do exists. You can get some serious amount of information by asking google or (even better) google scholar. I'm taking 1200 mg a day. As it's a food supplement, there will be no greater risk for your health.

906,"OCD is because of the state or attitude of mind where person thinks in one perticular way only, may be due to conditioning,learning, depression or past experience or even less development of brain etc., If such person can made to understand yoga in words and spirit, learn asanas, pranayam, meditation and cooperation,then Yoga can change his/her personality. Attitude, behaviour, patience and expectations will definitely change.",OCD
907,"Yoga can not cure OCD. Yoga is an attachment, can not repel or dispel. Relatives and friends of OCD persons should be more sympathetic and considerate. If an OCD person is ridiculed, his her self-esteem dive low and can aggravate to Schizophrenia. With regular interaction with considerate friends, an OCD can live an otherwise normal, happy mainstream life.",OCD
908,"There is limited scientific research on the specific effects of yoga on OCD. However, some studies have shown that yoga can be beneficial in managing symptoms of anxiety and stress, which are often associated with OCD. Additionally, the mind-body connection and mindfulness practices in yoga may help individuals with OCD to better manage their thoughts and impulses.
Some recommended yoga practices for individuals with OCD include:
1. Deep Breathing Techniques: Pranayama, or deep breathing exercises, can help to calm the mind and reduce anxiety and stress.
2. Meditation: Regular meditation practice can help individuals with OCD to become more aware of their thoughts and learn to let go of them without reacting.
3. Gentle Yoga Poses: Gentle yoga poses, such as forward folds, gentle twists, and restorative poses, can help to release tension and promote relaxation in the body.
4. Mindful Movement: Mindful movement practices, such as slow and intentional movements, can help individuals with OCD to become more aware of their body and its sensations, leading to a sense of grounding and calm.
It is important to note that yoga should not be used as a replacement for traditional treatment methods for OCD. It can be used as a complementary practice to support overall mental and physical well-being. It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise or treatment regimen.

909,"Yoga and meditation can help. I would also use another method to break your state. For example, when you notice the behavior happen, break your state using NLP. Become aware of your focus, physiology and language. First, what is your body doing? Change that. Next, what are you saying to yourself? Change your language and use some positive language about who you are outside of the behavior you want to change. Then your focus will change. You can do this by singing a song or doing an action that pulls you away from the OC behavior. Then when you learn new practices like yoga and meditation, these can help you unwind into an identity of a yoga practitioner and those identities will eventually take the place of the identity that causes the OC behavior.",OCD

OCPD: personality disorder: mental health condition that causes an extensive preoccupation with perfectionism, organization and control. These behaviors and thought patterns interfere with completing tasks and maintaining relationships. Here's the criteria from the DSM5. (4 symptoms or more)
-Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost
-Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g. - is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met)
-Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)
Is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)
Is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value
Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things
Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes
Shows rigidity and stubbornnes
-OCD: Anxiety disorder: is characterized by recurrent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions)
Criteria in DSM5:
Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both:
—Obsessions are defined by:
-Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress
-The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e. - by performing a compulsion)
—Compulsions are defined by:
-Repetitive behaviors (e.g. - hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g. - praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly
-The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive
—The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g. - take more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
—The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition

916,"I was in a group once with someone with OCPD. My takeaway from it was that he was an incredibly controlled, orderly individual. Everything had to be just so, and he seemed to have a shit ton of rules for himself. He also would have preferred that other people follow HIS rules for engagement, if that makes sense. But instead of causing him any kind of anxiety, as would be the case with OCD, all his rules and order were a source of pride for him. In fact, I almost got the sense he thought he was better than the rest of us at times. Maybe that's my projection. I'm not sure. I don't know if this helps. I'm not a doctor, but that's my experience.",OCD
917,"The symptoms of obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) include an excessive focus on orderliness, perfectionism, and control. People with OCPD often find it difficult to delegate tasks, are overly rigid in their thinking, and are preoccupied with details, rules, and lists. They may also be overly devoted to work, and have difficulty expressing emotion or forming close relationships.
OCPD differs from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in that OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, while OCPD is a personality disorder characterized by an excessive focus on orderliness and perfectionism. People with OCD often experience significant distress due to their intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors, while people with OCPD may not experience any distress but may have difficulty functioning in their daily lives due to their preoccupation with order and perfectionism.

918,"OCPD and OCD differ. A lot of people confuse them, even professionals.
Easiest way to sort is:
You might call a OCPD, a jerk or worse because their personality sucks and is controlling. ""My way is the right way"". A personality disorder. They are going to remain that way because it has beliefs behind it. ""It is the only way for people to live, including you. If not, You're stupid.""
OCD is about fear. Not getting the Jaws theme music out of your ears unless you DO something perfectly. More like a superstition. Turn the lock 5 times and then you can move on.

OCPD, Has their family or friends finally get fed up with the rudeness and insistence everyone else conform to their version of the world.
I've listed the common Diagnostic components in the DSM IV
Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder is:
A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:
(1) is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost
(2) shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict standards are not met)
(3) is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not accounted for by obvious economic necessity)
(4) is overconscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values (not accounted for by cultural or religious identification)
(5) is unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no sentimental value
(6) is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things
(7) adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes
(8) shows rigidity and stubbornness
Obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms include both obsessions and compulsions.
A. Either obsessions or compulsions:
Obsessions as defined by (1), (2), (3), and (4):
(1) recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and inappropriate and that cause marked anxiety or distress
(2) the thoughts, impulses, or images are not simply excessive worries about real-life problems
(3) the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, impulses, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action
(4) the person recognizes that the obsessional thoughts, impulses, or images are a product of his or her own mind (not imposed from without as in thought insertion)
Compulsions as defined by (1) and (2):
(1) repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly
(2) the behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts either are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or are clearly excessive
B. At some point during the course of the disorder, the person has recognized that the obsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable. Note: This does not apply to children.
C. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or usual social activities or relationships.
D. If another Axis I disorder is present, the content of the obsessions or compulsions is not restricted to it (e.g., preoccupation with food in the presence of an Eating Disorders; hair pulling in the presence of Trichotillomania; concern with appearance in the presence of Body Dysmorphic Disorder; preoccupation with drugs in the presence of a Substance Use Disorder; preoccupation with having a serious illness in the presence of Hypochondriasis; preoccupation with sexual urges or fantasies in the presence of a Paraphilia; or guilty ruminations in the presence of Major Depressive Disorder).
E. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.",OCD
919,"Few of the answers here have mistaken OCPD for OCD.
The biggest component is the ""P"" - that stands for personality. OCD and OCPD are entirely different, the latter being a personality disorder, though they might be comorbid. You are OCPD if mistaking this for OCD annoys you!

It is characterized by extreme attention to details, black & white thinking, expecting high standards from oneself and others.
You strive to be righteous always. You cannot see things as grey and you cannot tolerate the grey in yourself.
You cannot tolerate mediocrity in anything, even in your own self.
You will always strive hard to be a 100% in everything you do.
You will be organized, you will rarely forget any article in a safe place, you'll be able to find them soon more often than not.

If you want to be perfect and right always, you will be perfect 99% of the time. But the only sad thing (also the biggest) is, you'll never be happy about the missing 1%!",OCD
920,"There are many differences between OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and OCPD (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder)
People with OCD have symptoms that are egodystonic which means that they are uncomfortable having the symptoms of OCD and it doesn’t match with who they are. People with OCPD have symptoms that are egosyntonic which means that the person who is living with OCPD are not uncomfortable having the symptoms and it matches with their personality and who they are.
Unhealthy perfectionist tendencies are seen in OCPD like keeping everything in order, making unnecessary lists, being a workaholic, being very rigid about their views, following rules without any exceptions etc. People with OCD come in various categories like harm OCD, order and symmetry OCD, cleanliness OCD etc may not have any unhealthy perfectionist tendencies and there is one category of OCD called Perfectionist OCD but these people are not as unhealthy perfectionist as a person with OCPD.
People with OCD are not as opinionated as the person with OCPD as people with OCPD may have very rigid rules and might even break friendships over these views like they might not associate with people who don’t come on time.
People with OCD respond better to treatment and are more motivated to change their patterns as it causes them greater discomfort. People with OCPD sometimes don’t seek treatment and even if they do they might not show a great amount of change.
People with OCD are prone to ruminating a lot and thinking if they don’t engage in their compulsions something bad will happen. This can be so difficult at times these Obsessive thoughts keep them up at night. OCPD do have some anxiety due to which they try to control their environment but they don’t have Obsessive thoughts.
Miserliness is a trait which is associated with OCPD which is not associated with OCD. People with OCPD may earn a large amount of money but they never spend it.
OCPD is a pattern that is ingrained in the personality of a person as it is a personality disorder. OCD is not ingrained in a persons personality.
In order to diagnose someone with OCPD they need to be above 18 years of age. OCD can be diagnosed before the age of 18.
People with OCD might have compulsions that are repetitive in nature like taking bath 7 times a day or locking the door 10 times. People with OCPD don’t have compulsions wherein they repeat things again and again.",OCD
921,"Since I have no concept of the difference I am going to steal 93% of my answer from here:
""So today, let’s look at 5 important differences between OCPD and OCD:
Difference #1: Insight
Folks with OCD usually know that their thoughts are not exactly reasonable (“Did I turn off the stove? I’d better check,” or “If I wear unmatched socks, something bad will happen to my brother.”)
By contrast, individuals with OCPD believe their sky-high standards and work ethic are not only reasonable, but the only way to get things done.
Difference #2: Distress
In OCD, the obsessions and compulsions are stressful and unpleasant. For instance, feeling convinced you just drove over someone and circling back dozens of times to check for a body turns one’s stomach into knots. By contrast, for those with OCPD, the rigid schedules and rules of the condition are often comforting and feel right.
Difference #3: Guilt
In OCD, individuals can, but not always, feel guilty about asking others to conform to their rituals (for example, “I know it’s a hassle to put on shoe covers whenever you come inside, but I really, really need you to do that. I’m so sorry.”) On the flip side, those with OCPD think others should conform to their methods and firmly believe they’d be better off for it.
Difference #4: Anxiety
With OCD, compulsions - the actions someone with OCD can’t resist doing, like checking, counting, or washing - are performed to reduce anxiety. For instance, an individual with OCD might review her schedule for the day over and over again because she’s terrified she’s forgotten to include all her appointments.
By contrast, someone with OCPD might make and review a detailed schedule in order to be comprehensive and efficient. Anxiety isn’t part of the picture.
Difference #5: Time
By definition, OCD takes more than an hour a day. That’s right - part of an OCD diagnosis can be the fact that the obsessions, plus the compulsions to neutralize the obsessions, suck up a lot of time. OCPD, on the other hand, is more tightly interwoven to one’s personality. Rather than being an activity unto itself, the perfectionism and control of OCPD is more of a trait, not a time suck.

I have been jokingly referred to several times by acquaintances of being ""Monk- The obsessive compulsive detective"" Adrian Monk because of my method of analyzing complex problems we 'nerds' like to throw at each other. Nope. But I liked the show when I saw it and it was one of the few tv shows I would make an attempt to see. Sort of like Gotham these days.",OCD
922,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
923,"The main difference is that OCD involves a person having obsessions and compulsions. They end up performing a task over and over in order to satisfy some anxiety.
A person with OCPD has a personality trait/disorder versus an anxiety disorder. They do not have obsessions or compulsions. Just like any regular person, someone with OCPD may obsess a little over something from time to time, but not extensively or frequently.
OCPD is a whole lot more like a “perfectionist”. However, OCPD is usually perfectionism to an extra level. People with OCPD don't feel bad about it (usually). They are not bothered by obsessions or compulsions, and they see their excessive activities as necessary ways to increase efficiency in their lives.
A good concrete example of the difference?
OCD:
Obsession: fear that they will lose their job, and their family will then suffer, because they are not efficient enough at work.
Compulsive Action: Excessively makes “to do” lists and plans day religiously every morning for 2hrs, to maximize job efficiency, but to such a point that they even lose sight of what they are trying to make more efficient, or in spite of just getting the job done.
OCPD:
Excessively makes lists to maximize efficiency at work. Uses the latest tools and devices to increase efficiency. Etc.
They are not bothered by any of this. They enjoy it. I would definitely call OCPD the less severe in terms of really affecting the individual and causing life problems. However, the main issue with either of these is the rigidness. It will hinder relationships in either case because they will want people to bend to their ways and will usually not take no for an answer, or find compromise.
A person who can easily compromise for others needs, but thinks they have OCPD, is likely just what we would call a typical, “perfectionist” (which has none of the negative connotation of disorder attached to it).",OCD
924,"OCD and OCPD are not related and the similarity of name is because Freud didn’t understand this. People with OCD have obsessions and compulsions. People with OCPD don’t have obsessions or compulsions but are rigid, stingy, and think everyone should do everything the way they do.",OCD
925,Yes I do. It’s a subset of OCD where you scrutinize your feelings for your partner. You tend to focus on small qualities of your partner and ruminate constantly on wether or not they are the proper person for you. You become very sensitive to your feelings like sexual arousal and wether it’s adequate enough to stay in the relationship. You try and force the passionate or sexual response to them as you think it’s supposed to be. Because you have put pressure on yourself to feel a certain way it predictably doesn’t work as your brain doesn’t respond to pressure to be sexually aroused. You see relationships in movies or magazine stories that you see as perfect and then question wether the one you are with is really the right person. Everything small thing about your partner is scrutinized and left you questioning wether or not they are appropriate for you. There is usually a co morbid perfectionism diagnosis along with the OCD diagnosis. It’s treated a bit differently than those with other OCD theme diagnoses. Often it includes brining in you partner into therapy with you.,OCD
926,"I dont know anything except what I myself have lived through, experienced, and seen in my friends. I think it HaS something to do with codependency, I learned that in AL-ANON, I THINK it might HAV something to do with a dysfunctional relationship in childhood with your parents, that in adulthood you are still trying to “FIX” , perhaps unawares.

And healing from our failed love affairs. To end up at least having more self esteem , and a better sense of our own identity, to HAV a better sense of purpose, to find forgiveness in our hearts, and a better sense of peace with God, our Maker,it is pretty important to seek some type of counseling to learn to deal with these obsessions in relationships, these compulsions in life, as many of these problems CAN be overcome, and be healed, given time and work to do so , I had a DESIRE to get well, because I found these relationship obsessions to be a very anxiety producing, way to live, a very uncomfortable life experience.",OCD
927,"Of course! It’s called a personality disorder for a reason. If you ask any mental health professional what is bpd they will tell you it’s a set of maladaptive behaviors (toxic/destructive) on top of what’s called a fearful/ avoidant attachment style. I’ve come to learn bpd is much more than that, there are actual areas of the brain (emotional center: amygdala, pre frontal cortex, reduced grey matter) that are severely underdeveloped in a pwbpd. That means they DO NOT think or process information like the rest of us. Bpd is classified as an axis 2 mental illness which is one of the more extreme types. I personally put it on the same level as someone with schizophrenia, it’s that severe. What throws people off is that pwbpd tend to project a facade of someone who’s got it together. They also have shifting “self states” or facades so it’s hard to ever see the real person under all the masks.
Now, let’s dig into love and why it’s the greatest downfall of someone with bpd. The truth about bpd is that the individual didn’t receive the love they needed growing up from a primary care giver. This has left a hole inside of them that they are CONSTANTLY trying to fill with the love and acceptance of others. The Achilles heal is that pwbpd are intimacy intolerant. They CANNOT EVER accept or process true love and intimacy from others because they split. Borderlines are ruled by extreme irrational fears of abandonment and engulfment. The moment they feel true intimacy or the moment they feel afraid you’ll leave them is the moment the bizarre, confusing, toxic, manipulative behaviors come pouring out. That’s why pwbpd are constantly going from hot to cold, love to hate, happiness to misery. It’s a pattern for them and sadly no amount of love, support, compassion, or devotion will snap them out of it (codependents who think it will, please come back to reality… 🙄😞). Bpd is called a mental illness because without long term targeted therapy these things will continue to be a problem.
There’s one goal for a pwbpd. They are constantly searching for that perfect favorite person who’s infinite twin flame 🙄 love will consume them, heal them, fix them, and surround them forever. They want a perfect never ending supply of love and they will leave a trail of broken damaged ex partners on their quest to get it. Borderlines are extremely sensitive to everything. Good things feel amazing and negative things are overwhelming. Technically it’s called being emotionally disregulation and it’s why they are constantly acting extreme. The sad truth is pwbpd confuse feelings for facts all the time. They run and run and run and run from any and all negative feelings while running towards a rescuer, caretaker, lover who can fix everything and make them whole. Obviously this type of thinking and behaviors only causes more problems, but they can’t see it. Many of my bpd clients can’t tolerate being alone and many of them feel they are owed love by some cosmic force. It doesn’t matter how destructive they’ve proven to be, how out of control their life has become, how sick and consumed with pain they are. Their goal for finding that perfect favorite person to love them will always remain. Pwbpd prioritize love from a favorite person above everything else. In fact, nothing comes close to their need of love and intimacy. That’s why they idealize and devalue everyone they get close to. The real thing to remember (codependent partners 😞) is that the borderline doesn’t see you. They create a fantasy projection of who they think you are/ who they want you to be and they want you to play that role. The moment you prove to them you’re not this perfect fantasy is the moment the devaluation/ discards will begin. I think the codependent sickness from most partners is half the issue. Pwbpd are basically out of control love addicts. If they didn’t find codependent partners to continue to feed them their supply they wouldn’t be causing so much harm. We can see destructive drug addicts a mile away because we’ve always been taught drugs are bad for your mind and body. Sadly most of us believe love is something you can’t ever get to much of. The truth is that love to a untreated borderline is just as destructive and damaging as giving heroin to a junkie. Love is their fix and the more you flood them with it the more and more they want/ need. To heal a borderline needs to stop depending on love from others and they need to learn to love themselves.",OCD
928,"The honest answer is no. .. but also yes :-s
It's what people who have Borderline Personality Disorder experience but in turn is likely just a symptom of something else.
In my case I currently believe it's because I have a strong child identity who desires love and affection but I've sought it out in an adult way, which comes close but is never quite right.
The child rebels pushing a different identity to the front that rips the relationship up allowing the child to come back and start again.
Wash rinse repeat. ..
Fun fun fun.
Confusing?",OCD
929,"Yeah there is. It’s a really frustrating and sometimes debilitating subset of OCD. pretty much what happens when you have it is you begin to question and doubt every aspect of your relationship to the point it drives you insane, I believe it’s driven by the anxiety of wanting to know 100% your partner is “the right one” for you.

They may engage in compulsive behaviors like seeking reassurance, repeatedly analyzing their feelings, or constantly checking their partner's behavior.",OCD
931,"Unfortunately for me I know far to much about all aspects of OCD.
Going by what she can recall my mom has had OCD since the age of 7 or 8 and my ex developed an OCD after his father died suddenly.
Since I was living with it I decided to specialise in treated patients who also suffer from the same disorder.
The variables are incredible, even if I live to 120 I will not of seen each one however they all have a common thread, repetative thoughts and behaviours aimed at reducing sky high anxieties",OCD
932,"If it's what I think you're alluding to, it's when someone becomes obsessed with you. This can be annoying at best, dangerous at worst. I believe it is behind stalking behavior. It provides the anxious pressure behind delusions, rageful jealousy, and is especially scary for women. Women's shelters are filled with abused women victimized by obsessive boyfriends or husbands.
One shouldn't kid around with this sort of thing. If left to drag on, the obsessed person's sense of betrayal is all the more terrible and potentially wrathful. Set limits firmly and early. If you don't want to be around this person tell them straight out in a place that is safe. Make it very clear that you are not interested and don't think you have to let them down easy. The so called easy let down is a Big mistake, since this is a green light for the obsessive to merely try harder.

But I married, and am still in love with 16 years later, a man who has OCD. Not the germ kind, but one that still makes it difficult for him to touch people (I'm the exception, thankfully). If you're in love with them, then it feels like being in love — what did you think it would feel like? Lol. Do we have loads of challenges to work out? You bet. But every relationship does. And quite frankly, I prefer some of the challenges he brings to some of the other challenges I see people struggle with. I prefer him. If I had ten million men line up in front of me I'd still have chosen him every time.

Because when you set aside his OCD he's a great person. He has high values like I do. He's loyal. He says sorry. He works hard and is a great provider even though having a job exhausts him more than it does for other people. He's a loving, wonderful father to our four children. I mean, there were times he couldn't touch them at all, or even touch something they were touching (he got pretty bad for a little while), but he never stopped loving them and with determination and exposure therapy and countless medications he's been able to get things manageable and now he's more active with them than I am! (And he can touch them now. Not as much as I can, but enough for everyone to feel loved.)
It feels draining when you have to do a ton of work that others in your shoes have help with (changing diapers, for instance). It feels like an extra burden. It drives you crazy when they refuse help, or even if they refuse what you think is the “right” help or the “right amount” of exposure therapy. It drives you batty when they ask you to accommodate their compulsions when the literature states that you should not, and then they try to guilt you and shame you for not listening to what they asked. (But try to let this roll off you— they are likely acting out of fear and/or exhaustion.) It feels a little disappointing when they're too tired and strained to handle an outing, because they've been fighting with this disorder all dang day, or when they're always the first to want to leave a get-together because they're tapped out. But if they're willing to commit 100% to the relationship and if they're willing to try hard to get their OCD to a state where it's manageable for the two of you, and if you're willing to work with who they are and meet them halfway, without expecting them to magically cure themselves or act like a healthy person when they're not, then a romantic relationship with someone with OCD feels very much like a romantic relationship with anyone else. It feels like love.
I don't think he's my broken half. I think he's my better half. After 16 years I still feel like I married above myself.
Being with him hasn't made every day happy. But he's the kind of person that makes me a better person. And to me, that's better than happiness — it's long term joy.",OCD

935,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive and repetitive thoughts, known as obsessions, and repetitive behaviors, known as compulsions. The exact causes of OCD are not fully understood, but research suggests a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors may play a role. Some of the factors that may contribute to the development of OCD include:
Genetics: There is evidence that OCD may run in families and that certain genes may be involved in its development.
Brain structure and function: Abnormalities in certain regions of the brain and disruptions in the normal functioning of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, may contribute to the development of OCD.
Life events: Traumatic or stressful life events, such as abuse or neglect, may trigger the onset of OCD in some individuals.
Cognitive factors: Certain beliefs, attitudes, and thought patterns may contribute to the development and maintenance of OCD symptoms.
Environmental factors: Exposure to toxins, infections, or other environmental factors may play a role in the development of OCD in some individuals.

Empowering Mind, Body, Soul: Navigating Life",OCD
936,"I feel fairly qualified to answer this question since I've been diagnosed with ADHD and don't take medication. In a normal class setting, I was absolutely awful at math. I mean, I had to try so hard to get a C that it was purely embarrassing. I just couldn't grasp the concepts because I couldn't pay attention. All I heard was the teacher preaching to me arbitrary concepts with little practicality to real life. I would always ask the question ""When am I going to use this later on? What is the use case? What field am I going to use this in?""
Then, in 11th grade I had a math teacher who was incredibly different than the rest of the teachers I had previously had. She would teach the formulas from the ground up, provide a real life scenario, then assign homework that was scenario based. Often times, she would take us out of the class room to teach us the formulas in a different setting. This kept us engaged. I ended up getting an A in that class - the only A in math I ever got.
As someone with ADHD, I often find the best ways to keep me engaged in learning is by either teaching through gamification or through real life scenarios. This helps keep our attention, keeps us motivated, and encourages us to want to learn.
Keep in mind that us ADHD folks often think very outside of the box about problems. This is an asset and a liability for us. When it comes to logical problem solving, we're often not the best. Through scenario-based learning, it provides a frame of reference for solving the problem that can teach us the fundamentals of math from the ground up.
Hopefully this is helpful!",OCD
937,"In my case, I was running through a series of numbers in my head & then I'd do the same thing backwards. And as I counted away numbers obsessively inside my head. Id then add other warped thought that turned the Ritual into a “if I don't complete this ritual without getting a single number wrong then I've got to start from the beginning again” it morphed ? I was also attaching bad thoughts if I wasn't able to do it right ! I was always in a manic frame of mind. Id displayed OCD traits as early as 11. The fully suppressed emotions of years & years of abuse. With no way of ending the abuse. And unable to release my emotions. I'd developed these early OCD habits as an outlet & a release for my energy.",OCD
938,"Intriguing question. I was wondering the same right now! OCD mixed with PTSD and ADHD is just disgraceful (my case). I have a very high IQ but i often feel miserable because of my compulsive intrusive thoughts, depression and lack of focus, dramatically reducing my cognitive performance.
My advice would be:
Meditating (It makes your head a bit clearer and focused)
Brain training (specially games and activities that are stimulating and require high concentration). Lumosity, Chess, Sudoku and Dual N-Back are good examples of good resources.
Physical exercise (You’ll see a lot of improvement if you exercise regularly.)
Balanced diet(A good diet is also crucial for your cognitive performance. )
When you feel like you just can’t focus, take a break and try calm yourself trying to clear your mind taking some deep breaths, maybe eat a snack (avoid sugars, they will only make things worse.)",OCD

Thirdly you can use many app in play store with different quizes and mental maths in time bound environments .

940,"I am providing an answer based upon being a gifted child with dyslexia going through school at a time when there was no special education program for students like me. I either sank or swam. I did not have ADHD, but as a teacher, I do have experience in dealing with students who have ADHD and have a brother with it and a couple of nephews with it.
What worked best for me is not the way math is taught today. Today, concepts are introduced, students are given a few practice problems, then it is on to the next concept. The focus is to learn the name of math properties and solve problems based on specific math properties. There are many ways to solve specific math problems. In my day, especially when you got to higher math classes, the focus was on how to solve the problems, not on which math property you used.
So today students will get a problem marked wrong for solving it the wrong way. They got the correct answer, showed their work, but used the wrong method to solve it.
Do you know how frustrating that is to someone who is dyslexic? Many of us who are dyslexic think in pictures. After we learn math, we can think mathematically also. We absolutely do not think in words most of the time.
The old fashioned way worked well for me. It was drill and kill. I was taught the concept, the teacher demonstrated some practice problems. Then some students did some practice problems on the board. Then students did a few problems at their seat and some were called to write them on the board. Students were called to correct any problem that had any mistakes. Then there was more practice at your seat.
Then we had between 30 and 60 problems to do for homework. The next day, we might go over those problems in class, again students would be called on to solve some on the board. We might switch papers and correct. Then we would get some problems with increased difficulty and practice those in class and have 30 to 60 to do for homework. After mastery of that we would go on to the next concept. Every Friday was a quiz.
If a student needed help, we came before school, after school, or during lunch to see the teacher. I did a lot of that. Because of the dyslexia, I also spent several hours on the math homework. I had to do the problem and then do it again to make sure I did not make a careless mistake, (switch up numbers which would happen more often when I became increasingly stressed). I had to teach myself to take breaks and do other homework in between. I also had a job after school and had other obligations, so I had to manage my time.
By the way, we did not have calculators, the only calculators that were available were about $300 and could only do the 4 basic math functions. My father had one for work that cost nearly $2000 that he brought home once to show me. It was provided by his employer for his job and an engineering tech. It replaced his slide rule.
For a student with ADDH, you need to find a place to work that has minimal distraction and someone to sit with the student to help the student to focus. Provide regular breaks and have the student do physical activities on the break. I have had my ADDH students run things to the office. They run there and back and when I had a room near the track, I had them do a lap or two on the track once or twice a period.
I really would invest in a math tutor, nothing will beat that one on one instruction. The student needs lots of repitition. I really would wean the student off the calculator. Teach the student the multiplication table. There is nothing wrong to memorize it.
My students are amazed that I can still do math faster than they can and I do not use a calculator and they do. Today students think a calculator means they do not have to learn math, the calculator will do it for them. They need to understand the math before they can use the calculator. I know of many math teachers that are now banning calculators in class and require all work be done in class.",OCD
941,"OCD “Problems”. I’m going to assume you didn’t mean that offensively….People with OCD have “problems” because unlike what social media glorifies it as or put it into a category as. It’s a very hard disorder, and it’s come with a lot of struggles and impulses they can’t control. Thoughts of impending doom and things that feel very real to them, impulses are not their fault. It’s just that cards they’ve been dealt, which are shitty to be honest, but I hope people educate themselves so they can do all they can to help realize the reality of mental disorders.",OCD
942,"1. First and foremost thing that should be removed from minds of students is to remove fear of mathematics subject.
2. Go to basics ,to generate the good base of mathematics needs practical examples from our day to day life .
3. To motivate students to understand mathematics ,is easy subject and you get cash marks in examination and it increases % of students in examination.
4.practice, practice, more practice,do not leave your pen and notebook to solve mathematics problems.
5. Before solve questions,try to understand all related concepts and formulas about such questions.",OCD
943,"Students with dyslexia, ADHD, and OCD may face unique challenges when learning math and science. However, with the right strategies and accommodations, they can succeed in these subjects. Here are some suggestions for learning math and science effectively for a student with these conditions:
Multi-sensory instruction: Incorporate visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning methods. This can include using manipulatives, drawing diagrams, watching videos, listening to recordings, or using hands-on activities.
Break down complex concepts: Break complex topics into smaller, manageable steps. Teach one concept at a time, and ensure the student has a strong understanding before moving on to the next concept.
Use clear and concise language: Present information in simple, straightforward language, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary whenever possible.
Visual aids: Use visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, graphs, and color-coding to help clarify and organize information.
Provide structure and routine: Establish a consistent routine for study sessions, with clear expectations and goals. This can help students with ADHD and OCD manage their symptoms and stay focused on the task at hand.
Provide frequent breaks: Allow for regular breaks during study sessions to help maintain focus and prevent mental fatigue.
Use technology: Utilize assistive technology, such as text-to-speech programs, audio recordings, and specialized software or apps designed for students with learning differences.
Encourage self-monitoring and reflection: Teach the student to monitor their own progress, set goals, and reflect on their learning. This can help develop self-awareness and improve metacognitive skills.
Offer positive reinforcement: Praise the student's efforts and progress, providing encouragement and support to build their confidence in their abilities.
Seek accommodations: Work with the student's school to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 Plan, which can provide accommodations and modifications tailored to the student's needs.
Work with a tutor or specialist: If necessary, consider working with a tutor or educational specialist who has experience in teaching students with dyslexia, ADHD, and OCD.
Collaboration: Encourage group work or collaborative learning activities, which can provide additional support and opportunities for social interaction.
Teach coping strategies: Help the student develop coping strategies to manage their symptoms, such as relaxation techniques, organizational skills, or mindfulness practices.
Remember that every student is unique, and what works for one individual may not work for another. It's essential to be patient, flexible, and willing to experiment with different strategies to find the most effective approach for the student. Regular communication with the student, parents, and educators can help ensure that the student receives the support and resources they need to succeed in math and science.",OCD
944,"One of the great things about mathematics is there is no one “best way.” The best way depends on the student or the person doing the problem. The way that is “best” is the way that the individual understands best. A good teacher will evaluate the student’s current ability and determine their primary learning style, then teach the student according to that information. This is an individualized approach which does not always work in a classroom. That is when a student needs to seek out the teacher for additional instruction since a teacher cannot read minds.
Having said that, over-dependence on calculators is a sure way to make students struggle with mathematics since mathematics is more about relationships between numbers (patterns) and ideas rather than being about just the numbers.
My method has always been to try to teach students the patterns since one pattern covers a truly infinity of problems. If the student is only working mathematics through numbers rather than through ideas they are always going to struggle until they “see” the pattern or the reason why mathematics works the way it does.",OCD
945,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

946,"There is a chemical reason and an emotional one.
OCD attaches itself to something very important to you. And asks a continual “what if”.
So let's say you desire to be a good partner to your spouse because you love them, and biologically you are predisposed to OCD. How would this look?
Well, it may start out with thoughts like, “My partner seems mad. What did I do? Is my partner going to leave?” You ask and your partner is fine. Or was maybe upset over something easily resolvable.
But the what ifs continue. “My partner seems distant. Are they?” “Is my partner ok with my flaws? I mean are they too much for them to handle?” “Maybe my partner likes someone else” “Does my partner think of an ex and realize they made a mistake leaving them?”.
So you may seek reassurance. And you get it. But the reassurance doesn't seem to stop the thoughts. And the thoughts are getting louder.
It doesn't really matter your OCD flavor: fear of germs, fear of not being a good person, harm OCD, etc… The intrusive thoughts are painful because they question something very meaningful to you.
This is why it's important to understand what OCD wants. 100% certainty. And that is impossible (nothing the OCD questions will have a 100% certain answer). One must learn to live with uncertainty and not engage or give power to the thoughts.",OCD

948,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
949,OCD is an anxiety disorder. Its not a thought disorder. Although people with OCD are tormented by intrusive and unwanted thoughts its not the thought that is the problem. What happens is the anxiety producing part of thd brain is malfunctioning. It's mistakenly marrying up certain thoughts as a threat to your safety. The thoughts could be just about anything. The anxiety response to these thoughts compells the sufferer to try and solve the question of why they are having these these thoughts which leads to hours of daily ruminations. In an attempt to quell the anxiety and the need to solve why this id happening the sufferer will partake in all kinds if relief seeking rituals such as going to great lengths in avoiding anything that may trigger anxiety from these thoughts. They seek reassurances from others that they are okay and not insane. There are numerous ways they attemp to escape and find relief thought these ritualistic behaviors and rumination. Their goal is to rid themselves of these troubling thoughts however all these attempts to solve it backires with even more anxiety spiked or warnings that they are in some kind of danger. Because its an anxiety disorder all these attempts to seek safety or relief teach the anxiety producing part of their brain the amygdala that these thoughts are so important and unacceptable. It reinforces the amygdala that it is correct in sending out these anxiety spikes and the condition predictably worsens. Treatment for OCD is CBT therapy along with ERP which is Exposure anf response prevention. The therapy is designed to habituate the amygdala to the irrational fears by exposing it on purpose to the very thoughts that bother them so much. All attempts to quell the anxiety by ruminating or performing ritualistic behaviors are to be stopped. This turns the table on the OCD and teaches the amygdala that they are not in danger from these thoughts and in fact welcome them. Over time the amygdala will habituate to these thoughts and stop sending out spikes of anxiety from them. The thoughts them predictably recede. There are various OCD themes and subtypes but in the end they are all caused by an anxiety disorder and are all just bullshit that can be unwound with proper therapy.,OCD
950,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
951,"Simply put: its a thought that you don't want to be having, and actively upsets you to some extent.
For example: having random thoughts of killing family members, sexual thoughts about animals or children, or even thinking about driving your car off the road.
These intrusive thoughts in no way reflect the persons morals.
Some people are better at handling them at others, but most people have them.
An example of someone with excessive intrusive thoughts, or more intense ones, would be an individual with OCD (Like myself).
I struggle mostly with sexual thoughts and thoughts of extreme violence, they disturb me greatly but its good to remember that it doesn't have some sort of deeper meaning, its the the brain being trying to prevent you from doing something stupid.",OCD

953,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.
OCD is a mental condition that is linked with obsessive thoughts and behavior. Obsession, in this case, is highly unpleasant as the individual is compelled to repeat certain behavior again and again (such as washing their hands to avoid catching germs). This is to avoid their obsession turning into reality. The condition is anxiety-related and the thoughts are unwanted and intrusive. Sufferers often understand that these thoughts are irrational, but by performing compulsive behavior, they believe they will be cured or will be relieved.
Obsessive compulsive disorder can be categorized into 4 types:
Checking
Contamination
Hoarding
Intrusive Thoughts

954,"OCD sufferers are always fully aware that their obsessive thoughts do not have any meaning. They know that something's wrong with them right off the bat. They know what is it like to be 'normal', since the disease prominently manifests only after a certain age, and they know that if they WERE normal, they would NOT be having this thought in the first place.
It feels as if someone has hijacked your brain's emotional threat and worry assessment centres into constantly making you think the obsessive thought. The signals from the limbic system are too strong to ignore. Fear and worry are basal. How can someone typically [without training] ignore fear and worry?
You intellectually know that it is horse droppings, but you just cannot ignore those pure anomalous FEELINGS of ... conviction, of worry, of urge to do something. It takes considerable effort, if at all, to make those emotional signals subside.
For me, personally, I find that my brain can take up exactly one obsessive thought at a time. So I know what it is like to respond normally to a certain problem or thought EVEN IF that same thought came through the OCD loop some time ago: because my mind is currently occupied by SOME OTHER obsessive thought.",OCD

Also, have sensitive senses. Sense of smell so acute gas and diesel fumes especially cause my thought to sell, smoke as well. When a commuted I had an inhaler and hated how it made me feel. So you may believe my efforts are pointless and I’m over reacting being OCD but the truth is, I’m simply trying to keep myself healthy and living a calm stress free life. Hypertension a short circuit to my heart is why I avoid stress, avoid drama and live healthy. They call me a freak show. b/c fumes choke me up and I cannot breathe. just walk away when I’m having anxiety attacks or have fainted. Embarrased.
I believe my family have serious mental problems from their behavior and if I allow them in my life, a danger to my health. They wouldn’t bother calling 911 b/c they don’t want me in the family and never have.! truth is, OCD caused me to become obsessed with understand mental disorders, addictions, theology and holistic healing. to complete EMDR Therapy plus other courses and classes to become a healing minister Psychiatric case studies, and 3 courses to become a CLT helping others .
My need to learn all I could has me dealing with my issues and helping others. Some of my most abusive relatives are still allowing their bi-polar, depression, schizophrenia and/or dementia to go untreated and have blackouts, going into manic rages. That’s their normal. They think everything I do is pointless. I think their attitude towards me is extremely abusive and they need psychiatric help for their own issues and need to just stay out of my life completely. My fake family has never cared who I truly am. Just judge for what they do not understand.",OCD
956,"I can talk about myself and that might give you some insight about OCD.
I first experienced a very mild form of OCD when I was around 16 and that was due to academic pressure at school and by the hullabaloo about the colleges I should get in after I graduate from school.
By the time I reached 19, I gained some obsessions and compulsions — still I didn't realise just yet I might have had developed OCD and took it — as something that everyone around my age experiences.
At around 20— after many nervous episodes due to OCD — when my compulsions started hindering my life — I recognised my OCD and started working towards mitigating and controlling it with proven methods and mental restraint.
Now at 21 — after researching significantly and extensively on mental health — fought my way through a very mentally infuriating time due to OCD — I came about two conclusions about how OCD is developed.
One, the genetic inheritance — I realised it late but observing my dad and grandma’s actions and some memories from my childhood — I realised that they are also in a way suffering from OCD — my dad’s paranoia when a certain compulsion of his is not fulfilled and my grandma’s sudden anxiety attacks due to overthinking fell in the range of obsessions and compulsions. I believe that the OCD that I had cultivated is in some or the other way is inherited through genetics.
Second, the environment around you plays an important role as well. In my case — I had the genes that by getting triggered by outside factors resulted in OCD — that took me by surprise. The pressure of being in an engineering college was daunting and thus my mind began to cultivate notions, obsessions and compulsions — assuring me if I will follow a certain routine — I would be able to survive college.
There are genes and there are many outside factors that our brain perceives as dangerous which helps trigger OCD.",OCD
957,"I'm diagnosed OCD (30 years ago), and have made significant progress in dealing with it.
The cause(s) are probably some combination of heredity, environmental factors, and trauma. It's an “anxiety disorder,” in its basic sense: a person adopts repetitive behaviors in an attempt to reduce their feelings of anxiety - usually through distraction or doing something they think will improve their situation but it interferes with their ability to function normally.
In my situation, the medication “Zolaft” was the biggest game-changer in my life. I also did extensive behavioral therapy. But, the right medication made the biggest difference, by far. I had a lot of intense, long-term therapy to deal with my OCD. But, it completely disrupted the trajectory of my entire life. Basically, it took the entire decade of my 20's to deal with it.
I would advise you to seek out a very good, “Psycho-Pharmacologist.” They're basically a specialized Psychiatrist who can test your blood and pinpoint the exact medication that will work for you. It's expensive, but so is losing a decade of your life to OCD.",OCD
958,"OCD is not the kind of a disorder that involves a so called cause to be exact. Even at this stage, scientists can only attribute it to a neuro chemical imbalance in the brain mainly due to alteration in the levels of neurotransmitters.
As for the treatment, like I mentioned it's not a disease or disorder that requires treatment except in severe anxiety associated OCD.
That being said , doctors usually recommend anti depressant drugs such as fluvoxetine(Prozac in US), fluvoxamine for the treatment of OCD, primarily because OCD is classified under neurotic disorders. However, these drugs come with a black box warning that these are suicidal ideation drugs so should be prescribed with great caution.
However, individuals with OCD should be treated with mainly kindness and understanding because these patients are aware that they have this condition and should be treated with understanding more than anything else.
However one should take care not to play along with the mindset of these people because that could just aggrevate their symptoms.",OCD
959,"There is no one answer to this question, as OCD can be caused by a variety of factors. Some people may be more genetically predisposed to developing OCD, while others may develop it after experiencing a traumatic event.
There are a few different ways to relieve OCD symptoms. Some people find relief through therapy and medication, while others find relief through self-care and lifestyle changes. It's important to work with a doctor or therapist to find the best treatment plan for you.",OCD
960,"Mild Depression: Are Antidepressants Necessary?
In cases of mild depression, antidepressants may not be the first line of treatment.
Long-term use can lead to dependency without significantly improving symptoms for some.
Behavioral therapy, lifestyle changes, or mindfulness techniques are often recommended first.
If antidepressants are used, a careful balance must be maintained to avoid over-reliance.
Moderate Depression: Managing Symptoms with Antidepressants
Individuals with moderate depression often benefit more from antidepressants.
Long-term use can help stabilize mood, but the risk of side effects like weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and emotional blunting becomes a concern.
Antidepressants may improve quality of life, but regular evaluation with a healthcare provider is essential.
Severe Depression: Lifesaving, But Watch for Tolerance
For severe depression, antidepressants are often critical and may be life-saving.
Long-term use may be necessary, but tolerance to medication can develop over time, requiring dose adjustments or medication changes.
Side effects are more pronounced but are often outweighed by the benefits in managing severe symptoms like suicidal thoughts.
Potential Long-Term Effects to Consider
Physical Effects: Weight gain, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are common side effects.
Mental Health: Emotional numbness, loss of motivation, and cognitive decline can occur over time.
Dependency: Long-term users may find it difficult to stop, experiencing withdrawal symptoms even when tapering off gradually.
It's essential for individuals on long-term antidepressants to work closely with their healthcare provider to monitor both the benefits and side effects. Antidepressants can be highly effective but must be carefully managed, especially over extended periods.",OCD
961,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

963,"The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is not fully understood. It is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors. Some research suggests that imbalances in certain brain chemicals, such as serotonin, may play a role in the development of OCD.
OCD can be relieved through a combination of therapy, medication, and self-help strategies. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of therapy for OCD. It involves identifying and challenging negative thoughts and behaviors and learning coping skills to manage them. Medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be prescribed to help reduce symptoms. Self-help strategies, such as relaxation techniques and stress management, can also be beneficial in managing OCD symptoms. It is important to work with a mental health professional to develop a personalized treatment plan for OCD.
“Do you or someone you know struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder? Don’t miss the opportunity to learn about its causes and effective relief methods in the link in our bio.”",OCD
964,"I think it’s different for each person but it could come from anything. It’s alike to having thoughts popping up inside your head but you’re unable to erase some that surfaces. As a novice living with it for more than 20 years I’d overcome most of my previous thought patterns by seeing it for what it is merely thoughts that surfaces then cease to exist.
No amount of medication can do that it takes time. Maybe it was cause I finally understood the idea of letting go.",OCD
965,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",OCD
966,"Because society has placed OCD as either a silly quirk or something to aspire to.
You see people who want things to be organized and clean, and they say, “I'm so OCD”. I need things in order.
People see how nice and clean their home is, and think OCD must not be all that bad.
The truth is far from this.
A person who likes a neat and organized home is just someone who likes it. It's not OCD.
OCD is debilitating. The person who keeps their home clean because they have OCD would never say, “I'm so OCD”.
Because they have intrusive thoughts. Very haunting and disturbing thoughts that repeat over and over. They clean to try and make the thoughts stop…or something bad will happen if they don't.
In fact, MOST people with OCD are NOT clean and orderly. MOST are not frequent hand washers.
Society makes OCD seem like something not all that bad.

969,"Well, the phrase “OCD” as used as a descriptive label for one or someone’s behavior is well-known (ex: “I am so OCD”). If you’re talking about true OCD, beyond the misconceptions, then that likely more has to do with the poor understanding of debilitating mental conditions in general. It seems that, unless any given person has OCD themselves, has a family member or friend who has OCD, or they have an interest in psychological topics in the same ballpark, they probably know little about OCD.",OCD
970,"Since I have no concept of the difference I am going to steal 93% of my answer from here:
""So today, let’s look at 5 important differences between OCPD and OCD:
Difference #1: Insight
Folks with OCD usually know that their thoughts are not exactly reasonable (“Did I turn off the stove? I’d better check,” or “If I wear unmatched socks, something bad will happen to my brother.”)
By contrast, individuals with OCPD believe their sky-high standards and work ethic are not only reasonable, but the only way to get things done.
Difference #2: Distress
In OCD, the obsessions and compulsions are stressful and unpleasant. For instance, feeling convinced you just drove over someone and circling back dozens of times to check for a body turns one’s stomach into knots. By contrast, for those with OCPD, the rigid schedules and rules of the condition are often comforting and feel right.
Difference #3: Guilt
In OCD, individuals can, but not always, feel guilty about asking others to conform to their rituals (for example, “I know it’s a hassle to put on shoe covers whenever you come inside, but I really, really need you to do that. I’m so sorry.”) On the flip side, those with OCPD think others should conform to their methods and firmly believe they’d be better off for it.
Difference #4: Anxiety
With OCD, compulsions - the actions someone with OCD can’t resist doing, like checking, counting, or washing - are performed to reduce anxiety. For instance, an individual with OCD might review her schedule for the day over and over again because she’s terrified she’s forgotten to include all her appointments.
By contrast, someone with OCPD might make and review a detailed schedule in order to be comprehensive and efficient. Anxiety isn’t part of the picture.
Difference #5: Time
By definition, OCD takes more than an hour a day. That’s right - part of an OCD diagnosis can be the fact that the obsessions, plus the compulsions to neutralize the obsessions, suck up a lot of time. OCPD, on the other hand, is more tightly interwoven to one’s personality. Rather than being an activity unto itself, the perfectionism and control of OCPD is more of a trait, not a time suck.

I have been jokingly referred to several times by acquaintances of being ""Monk- The obsessive compulsive detective"" Adrian Monk because of my method of analyzing complex problems we 'nerds' like to throw at each other. Nope. But I liked the show when I saw it and it was one of the few tv shows I would make an attempt to see. Sort of like Gotham these days.",OCD
971,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD

973,"No hate or anything here, but OCD is just like, can’t stand things being imperfect, so how is that like a huge deal, because I saw huge tributes to people with OCD and I just don’t understand, I mean they do get annoyed when things aren’t their way, but that’s it.
SO difficult for me to not violate BNBR right now, but I’m going to try my best.
OCD is not about “can’t stand things being imperfect” or “getting annoyed when things aren’t their way”. “Annoyance” can’t even come close to describing the feelings that obsessions cause. “Terror” is more like it.
There are so many different types of OCD. Not everyone with OCD is a germophobe - I’m not. OCD isn’t perfectionism, or wanting things in order or especially neat and tidy. It’s far more than that, and you would do well to actually learn about the disorder before you make statements like the one quoted above.
Imagine you leave your house for work or school in the morning. You check your stove to make sure it’s turned off. You may not even have used the stove since the last time you left the house, but you still have to make sure it’s off. Before you walk out the door you go back to the kitchen and check the stove one more time to make sure. You touch each knob and as you do, you whisper to yourself “off”. It’s the only way you can convince your brain that the stove is off.
Then you lock your door on the way out, and check that a few times to make sure it’s really locked. You turn the knob exactly three times. You leave for the bus, but halfway to the bus stop, a thought pops into your head: are you sure you checked the stove? (No, I checked it, remember? It’s off, I’m sure.) But what if you accidentally turned it on when you checked it? What if you left it on and the building burns down? What if? And what about the door? Are you sure you locked it? (No, I locked it.) But are you sure? Because if you didn’t, anyone could just walk right in and take anything they want. Maybe you didn’t lock it.
Then you turn around and go back home to make sure the stove is really off and the door is really locked. You’re going to miss your bus and be late for work, but these thoughts are yammering nonstop in your head, going over all the horrific things that could happen if you don’t go back and check one more time.
That’s just one small example of what my life was like before I got into therapy and learned how to cope with OCD. That scenario happened every time I left the house. I can’t tell you how many times I was late for work. I won’t get into the number phobias, the counting of everything, the time I used my entire lunch break at work to go home and make sure I had turned the iron off (I got home to find I had not only turned it off, but unplugged it and left it in the bathtub just in case it wasn’t completely cool yet). I won’t tell you how often I worried obsessively that I would somehow do something to hurt one of my pets or friends or relatives or even a stranger.
Does any of that sound like fun to you? Does it sound “annoying”, or like “no big deal”?
Believe me - when it’s happening to you, it’s a very big deal. My OCD is well controlled these days, but it’s still there - it can be managed, but there’s no cure. I still check the stove when I leave the house; it’s just these days I can manage to only do it once. Same with the door locks. I still count and I’m still weird about certain numbers, but those things don’t have as pronounced an effect on my life, so I don’t worry about them that much. The point is, it’s easy to have preconceived notions about something you’ve never had to experience, and to be certain that it’s not that big a deal. But in your case, you are dead wrong about what OCD actually is. And I hope you decide to fully educate yourself about it before you ever say again that it seems like no big deal.",OCD
974,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and/or behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over.
OCD is a mental condition that is linked with obsessive thoughts and behavior. Obsession, in this case, is highly unpleasant as the individual is compelled to repeat certain behavior again and again (such as washing their hands to avoid catching germs). This is to avoid their obsession turning into reality. The condition is anxiety-related and the thoughts are unwanted and intrusive. Sufferers often understand that these thoughts are irrational, but by performing compulsive behavior, they believe they will be cured or will be relieved.
Obsessive compulsive disorder can be categorized into 4 types:
Checking
Contamination
Hoarding
Intrusive Thoughts

975,OCD is an anxiety disorder. Its not a thought disorder. Although people with OCD are tormented by intrusive and unwanted thoughts its not the thought that is the problem. What happens is the anxiety producing part of thd brain is malfunctioning. It's mistakenly marrying up certain thoughts as a threat to your safety. The thoughts could be just about anything. The anxiety response to these thoughts compells the sufferer to try and solve the question of why they are having these these thoughts which leads to hours of daily ruminations. In an attempt to quell the anxiety and the need to solve why this id happening the sufferer will partake in all kinds if relief seeking rituals such as going to great lengths in avoiding anything that may trigger anxiety from these thoughts. They seek reassurances from others that they are okay and not insane. There are numerous ways they attemp to escape and find relief thought these ritualistic behaviors and rumination. Their goal is to rid themselves of these troubling thoughts however all these attempts to solve it backires with even more anxiety spiked or warnings that they are in some kind of danger. Because its an anxiety disorder all these attempts to seek safety or relief teach the anxiety producing part of their brain the amygdala that these thoughts are so important and unacceptable. It reinforces the amygdala that it is correct in sending out these anxiety spikes and the condition predictably worsens. Treatment for OCD is CBT therapy along with ERP which is Exposure anf response prevention. The therapy is designed to habituate the amygdala to the irrational fears by exposing it on purpose to the very thoughts that bother them so much. All attempts to quell the anxiety by ruminating or performing ritualistic behaviors are to be stopped. This turns the table on the OCD and teaches the amygdala that they are not in danger from these thoughts and in fact welcome them. Over time the amygdala will habituate to these thoughts and stop sending out spikes of anxiety from them. The thoughts them predictably recede. There are various OCD themes and subtypes but in the end they are all caused by an anxiety disorder and are all just bullshit that can be unwound with proper therapy.,OCD
976,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder in which time people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). Compulsions are learned behaviours, which become repetitive and habitual when they are associated with relief from anxiety. OCD is due to genetic and hereditary factors. Chemical, structural and functional abnormalities in the brain are the cause. Distorted beliefs reinforce and maintain symptoms associated with OCD. Go to my Profile and you can find all about anxiety disorder material there...",OCD
977,"Yes and no.
Let’s bring the question back to a more precise, psychodynamic and structural vocabulary of nosology: anxiety disorder is broader what we call neurosis and better yet transferencial neurosis (as opposed to both narcisical neurosis and neurastenia or nowadays neurosis or post-traumatic neurosis or war neurosis).
“Obsessive compulsive disorder” is not a nosographic cathegory in Psychoanalysis, but rather a sort of symptom - it may appear in obsessive neurosis, which is from the field of what you are calling “anxiety disorder”, but may also appear in a perverse structure (as Freud showed in the mode of work in painting of Leonardo da Vinci) and in a psycosis (as you can see in a case I tell about in Lucas Jerzy Portela's answer to Can CBT be harmful or have side effects?).
This distinction is usually overlooked by CBT with harmful consequences. I will quote the part were I describe it:
I for instance saw a presentation of clinical cases, alegadely of a patient suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which was filmed (how unethical is that?!) to show how successfull the clinician was (more unethical still). The success consisted to lead the patient to be able to touch in a telephone and in money again - which actually failed as the treatment needed to be reinitiated three times. The case was clearly not of an “obsessive compulsive disorder”: this inhibition of not touching in phones or money was caused by a never investigated underlying delusion as it was clearly a case of psychosis paranoid (we can not say if it was a proper schizophrenia or a paranoia because, well, this was not investigated). When I pointed those critics out in the presentation, the clinician got offended",OCD
978,"Yes, there are 5 major subtypes of anxiety disorder.
Generalized anxiety disorder
Panic disorder
Social anxiety disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder
And, obsessive-compulsive disorder
Hypochondriasis, or hypochondria, can also be considered a type of anxiety, but is not listed as one of the major types of anxiety disorder, and is rather listed as its own condition.",OCD
979,"It is not considered under the umbrella of anxiety disorders, but it s closely related, and those who suffer from OCD usually have co-occurring mental health issues. I have experienced this condition, and it is based on doubt. I think shame, guilt, perfectionism also contribute to the condition.
Intrusive thoughts that are disturbing cause distress, in which they become obsessions and people learn to behave (compulsions)or think in a certain way as a defense mechanism that the sufferer believes will stop the obsessions, or give them temporary relief of the perceived threat. I think it has to do with a neurological dysfunction when we are young we have a magical sense that we can effect things and can do things that are extraordinary. This can show up as an obsession that if I step on a crack in the sidewalk, it will break your mothers back. This is a very tortuous condition, and can be very debilitating.",OCD
980,"Hi there Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder OCD is a mental disorder in which there is a need to repeat certain routines, these are called compulsions or repeated thoughts, referred to as obsessions. But, before dealing with the issues, I would get a medical diagnosis.
If you have a family member with OCD you may be more at risk of having OCD.
I have helped people over the years and I have found this to be true. If you see a close family member dealing with situations in this manner, you can be liable to copy those behaviours.
OCD may cause lower levels of a chemical called serotonin or areas of increased brain activity. This is the part where you are inclined to repeat simple activities like washing your hands over and over again, thinking they are unclean, when in fact they are not.
Life experiences such as bullying, lack of self-esteem, or in my experience having to compete with older siblings, or abuse may mean that some people are more at risk of experiencing OCD. OCD may also develop after significant life events such as bereavement.
You can find a way out of OCD with the right help and support and a firm understanding of why you are exhibiting the behaviours.
I hope you have found this useful.

981,"To understand this question better first let's see the difference between Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Let us talk about the symptoms of Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which will give us a fair idea and understanding.
When a thought becomes repetitive and when it becomes a continued occurrence, we can term that as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The word Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has the answers. When something ""it could be even a simple habit"" that gets Compulsive in our lifestyle and gaining absolute comfort with that habit.
Anxiety Disorder is when we get over-excited about simple things or in other words for no reason you get constant tension when we really do not have to get tensed.
Though Compulsive Disorder sounds much like a habit and we might think that is not a big deal. This might eventually lead us to Generalized Anxiety Disorder and even worse.
A simple habit of cleaning certain places in a house every day which is, of course, a good habit. Let's say just in case if we forget by mistake someday, for a few this is not a big deal, but for a few this could be a repetitive thought for the whole day.
Piling up multiple issues like this can increase the Anxiety levels and I would say that OCD and GAD are interlinked.",OCD
982,"Both! OCD an OCPD sound alike but are very different.
People have asked me what’s the hardest diagnosis to treat. I start off by saying “I don’t treat diagnoses, I treat people.” If they push me up against a wall and threaten torture, I’ll probably admit that OCPD is the toughest, by far.
OCD:
You have crazy little thoughts that are unwelcome and distressing but won’t go away no matter what you do. They are so upsetting that you do things that look weird to others in hopes of dispelling the thoughts.
You engage in strange behaviors like cleaning, counting, tapping, checking over and over, hand-washing. Sometimes you do these to ward off bad things — infection, disaster, or maybe even someone dying. The behaviors often look like rituals — flipping a light switch six times the touching your nose — things like that.
OCD symptoms can range from mild and annoying and eccentric to full-out disabling.
OCPD:
You are an extreme perfectionist about certain things and relationships and environments, and will do anything not to give up control or the illusion of control. You are utterly inflexible and avoid new experiences. You are preocupied by rules, lists, details so much you miss the point of an activity.
Interpersonally, your devotion to work and your routine comes at the expense of family and friends. You are morally inflexible and rigid about values. You are a hoarder and can’t get rid of anything without great anxiety. You are so into control that you find it hard to follow a doctor’s orders about anything, and you will probably resist psychotropic medication at all costs.
DIFFERENCES:
Speaking broadly, folks with OCD may seek help whereas those with OCPD likely won’t. Folks with OCD have fluctuating anxiety, but OCPD people tend to be inflexible and unchanging long term.

983,"No. The answer is in the name—it is a personality disorder. It roots are in the a disordered personality—not in an anxiety disorder. There is no medication for this disorder. The anxiety we see in people with OCD is not that evident in Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders. Rigidity, order, predictability, schedules, control, perfection—these are hallmarks of this disorder. Distress occurs when things get out of control. when the routine is disrupted, when perfection is not attained. The person is so busy with these aspects, that the other aspects of living, a personal life, friends, lovers, spontaneous fun, family are neglected. Watch Jack Nicholson in the film: AS GOOD AS IT GETS. He does a pretty real job of portraying this personality disorder—and the problems it brings.",OCD
984,"OCPD should not be confused with OCD. OCD is one of the six anxiety disorders.
However Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder is not an anxiety disorder. As the name implies it is a personality disorder. OCPD is one of the three anxious/fearful Cluster C personality disorders.
It is characterized by rigid perfectionism, orderliness, and attention to detail.
Thanks",OCD
985,"OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder is indeed listed in the DSM-V as one of the anxiety orders.",OCD
986,"Haha, no. But my obsessions and compulsions are not contamination related. I know a girl who showered for 8 hours a day. As for me, I’m messy. My room looks like a tornado went through it; my office is disorganized; I am the queen of dry shampoo.
It is a misconception that people with OCD are neat freaks. It all depends on ones OCD themes. Mine are (or were… I've been in remission 10 years) related to scrupulosity and hyperresponsibility.
Here’s a pic of me after days of not showering. Thanks, dry shampoo!!",OCD
987,"OCD is a very broad spectrum disorder. People suffering from OCD can have multiple irrational fears, ranging from the fear of a specific number to the fear of microbes. If a person’s OCD projects not being clean as a threat, in such a case, a person can shower multiple times a day.
In some extreme cases a person suffering from contamination OCD might keep on cleaning his body (or parts of the body, most commonly hands) until his skin has cuts. Again, showering multiple times is not a difficulty every person with OCD suffers from.",OCD
988,"No two people with OCD are the same. How often I shower depends on my level of activity and how hot it is. In the summer months I shower at least once a day because of being sweaty and what not but this time if year, in winter, I can easily go two or even three between showers if I don't get particularly gross and sometimes I just sponge bath.
My OCD however generally has to do with my hands being clean but when I'm under massive stress I sometimes find I have other rituals too. My hand washing compulsion is not about germs however, it's about them feeling clean. My hands start to feel gritty and gross after doing just about anything or sometimes nothing at all I can have a panic attack if I don't take care of it.
Daily showering may have nothing at all to do with obsessive compulsive disorder.",OCD
989,"Not necessarily. Not all people with an OCPD or OCD have intrusive/compulsive thoughts about hygiene and aversion to microbes.
Germaphobes are more likely to do that, but even in this case it’s not a diagnostic trait/sign, or manifestation of the condition.",OCD
990,"Nope. I haven’t had any obsessions or compulsions for almost 10 months now. Although my OCD wasn’t to do with contamination. Contamination is a big stereotype of OCD.
However those who do have contamination OCD can bathe/shower multiple times a day and wash their hands raw depending on how severe their intrusive thoughts are. OCD is debilitating.",OCD
991,"Original question: “As a person with OCD, how often do you bathe?”
Once a day.
This question assumes — as around 90% of people without OCD seem to assume — that OCD = germophobia. This is one of the most frustrating things for me as an OCD sufferer.
Fear of germs is properly called mysophobia. Yes, many people with OCD are mysophobes and may bathe or wash their hands excessively.
For many more of us, the disorder manifests in totally different ways. I'm not a mysophobe; I'm a checker and a counter who also has some number phobias/aversions.
So, yeah — I bathe no more or less frequently than the average person I know without OCD. Going forward, please: don't assume that having OCD automatically means someone has a fear of germs. Even in other answers here you can see that that is not the case.",OCD
992,"I'm not 100 percent sure but if I feel that I need to shower then I'm going to… doesn't matter if it's 2, 3 or 4 time's in a day…",OCD
993,"In a person’s brain, a bell goes off- “did I wash my hand?, I touched my shoes and that could cause an infection”. People have similar thoughts across the board, but in a brain without OCD, it goes to another part of the brain which allows you to calm the alarm center by washing your hands, and you get an all clear signal. In a brain with OCD, there is no all clear signal. The thought bounces back and forth between action and worry, action and worry, action and worry. It’s like a fire alarm going off that you keep trying to shut off with a towel but it keeps blaring no matter what you do. They know their thoughts are irrational, but don’t you hear the alarm blaring?! OCD is now found to be a neurological disorder, not a psychological one. On a brain scan, it can clearly be seen.
How do you stop the compulsions? Generally a mixture of medication (to calm the thoughts) and cognitive behavioral therapy is used. It’s not easy by any means but the general idea is to hold oneself back from acting on the compulsions. Eventually the alarm will stop blaring and the anxiety around it will calm down. There’s no cure but it can be managed, with help from a professional and compassion from those around you.
If you want to understand it further, I can explain the exact mechanism that is going on in the brain, specifically the basal ganglia. I would also suggest two books that explain really well what it is like living with OCD, Kissing Doorknobs and Turtles All the Way Down, the new John Green book (he has OCD).",OCD
994,"My OCD doesn’t really have any impact on my hygiene. I have a form of OCD called Pure O which is not like traditional OCD. Pure O stands for Purely Obsessive that mean I have intrusive thoughts minus the obvious physical compulsions. I dont repeatedly wash my hands or check door knobs like people with regular OCD. People with Pure O tend to have intrusive thoughts revolving around sexually deviancy, extreme violence, religion, morality and self harm. For me I mostly experience intrusive thoughts that are sexually violent in nature. I must make myself very clear these thoughts are unwanted and do not in any way reflect who I am as a person. Those who suffer from Pure O don’t have physical compulsions. So if I had a thought about killing someone or myself I am not going to compulsively act out my thoughts. Instead I tend to have mental compulsions such as avoiding things that trigger may trigger my thoughts. On the other hand those who suffer from typical OCD might have compulsive thoughts revolving around their hygiene which could cause them to compulsively wash there hands or vice versa.",OCD
995,"Well I feel this is one horrible terrible disease.
1)praying continuously for minutes before food.I can't stand any disturbance in between, and if something occur I even abstain from having food, even if I feel dying with hunger.
2)I want other to say word “cancel “ if any of there word hurts or disturbs me. I feel If they don't say so.. Something bad is going to happen for my loved ones
3) sometimes point 2 , makes me angry if someone hesitate to say CANCEL, which further disturbs my mood and turns me frantic, and make me pray crying.
4) some times weird images of dead body of my loved ones( the sole impetus for my existence in this world) comes to my mind, which splits my soul Out of body,which compels me to pray
5)i often feels my hands are dirty and keep washing my hands and face many times a day.
6) checking my room thoroughly to see if any one Is hiding in my room
7) the main problem haunting me is the sexual obsession I'm experiencing these days. I can't have good time with my husband, I gets strange feeling of some one sexually misbehaving to me, whenever I think of sex.
Anyone reading this, if you have any opinions to help me out especially the last one. (I tried many medicines, therapy,) please do comment.",OCD
996,"I've had OCD since day one. Pure O, as far as I can tell. It reached its peak when I was in my mid twenties but thanks to the advent of SSRI’s I have been able to manage the symptoms pretty well. I am hearing great things about Cognitive Behavioal Therapy (CBT) but I have yet to really check it out.",OCD
997,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
998,"Personally, I remember having a brief episode of OCD, when I was about 10 years old. I needed to turn on and off the lights of the corridor lots of times before sleeping. It lasted for one or two weeks, it was a bit shocking, I was surprised to act like that, but then it stopped and I never gave it any more relevance. And that was all. However, I have had episodes of obsessive ideas (nothing apparently important, just some kind of random daily issues) coming to my mind over and over again, both in my adolescence and adulthood, but it is unusual.
I've never had any breakdown or psychotic episode ever, but I am reading about it right now as a real risk for schizoids, and would like to ask you about it. The closest episode to that I can remember happened two times, when the chance of approaching beautiful girls, that my body started to shake and I could not control it for a couple of minutes ‘till it stopped.",OCD
999,"I would rather say Paranoid then Obsessive-Compulsive disorder.
I wash my hands 20–30 times a day, and that’s not an exaggeration. That’s the actual numerical estimate.
Once I’ve locked the doors of my lair, I have to repeatedly touch the doorknob and try to open them to make sure they’re locked. Usually 4 times or any multiple of 4.
I analyze words. I just counted the ratio of vowels and consonants in the previous sentence.
As I’m writing this, I’m intermittently looking at my closed window and door to make sure they’re still closed.
When I walk outside I have to continuously check if my phone is still in my pocket. I sometimes stop to take a look at if the zipper of my bag is closed.
It’s getting better with time, but it’s still insanely frustrating. I’m looking for ways to attain peace of mind.",OCD
1000,"John Coctostan and Amon Sloter both provide good insight. It may not be what people want to hear, but they call it like it is.
I also don’t agree with Adelia Benitez, not all narcissists are outright manipulators. And narcissists can control their behaviours, it’s just if the choose to and if it is a benefit to them to do so.
To truly understand the Narcissitic disorder we have to look at a broad spectrum of people and traits associated with them. No two are identical. Same as opinions also differ between victims.",OCD
1001,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
1002,"In my case, I was running through a series of numbers in my head & then I'd do the same thing backwards. And as I counted away numbers obsessively inside my head. Id then add other warped thought that turned the Ritual into a “if I don't complete this ritual without getting a single number wrong then I've got to start from the beginning again” it morphed ? I was also attaching bad thoughts if I wasn't able to do it right ! I was always in a manic frame of mind. Id displayed OCD traits as early as 11. The fully suppressed emotions of years & years of abuse. With no way of ending the abuse. And unable to release my emotions. I'd developed these early OCD habits as an outlet & a release for my energy.",OCD
1003,"It really depends. Over my time here in Quora, I've learned that living with OCD and being on Quora can have both positive and negative effects. What I've concluded, however, is that it mostly depends on what your OCD ""level"" is, or how far along you are in treatment, or how your OCD is expressed in your behavior.
When I was at the peak of my struggle with OCD, one of the main ""characteristics"" of it was reassurance questions. This basically means that about eighty percent of what came out of my mouth in the form of words was a question, or a statement, seeking reassurance.
Example of an obvious reassurance question/statement:
Setting: I'm opening the fridge. I take out the milk, debating whether or not I should have some. The expiry date is a week from today.
Statement: Hey, mom - can you come here and sniff this milk? I think it's expired.
What I'm actually saying: I think this milk is expired even though deep down I know it isn't, but I just need you to check for me just in case because I don't want to drink it if it's bad, because then I might throw up, so please just check it and let me know it's totally and completely and utterly fine and okay to drink.
Outcome: Mom smells the milk. Reassures me it's okay to drink. No, you won't throw up. Yes, I'm sure. The milk is one hundred percent okay.
Example of a less obvious reassurance question/statement:
Setting: I'm eating an apple.
Statement: This apple tastes kind of weird.
What I'm actually saying: I think this apple is rotten or poisoned or something, please reassure me it's okay and I won't die from eating it.
Outcome: Of course the apple's fine, it's okay, I bought it yesterday, it's nothing, you can eat it, Mom says.
These questions or statements were ""full of OCD"" - practically everything I would do relied on reassurance from a parent or other family member.
These reassurance statements were exceptionally hard to conquer once I began an OCD treatment program. They were a core part of my OCD, and they might be a big factor in your OCD as well. This is where the negative parts come in.
A couple of years ago I asked a now-deleted question on Quora regarding food for a school trip. I wanted to know what foods I could take that wouldn't spoil, so I wouldn't have to eat the food school provided out of fear it would be spoiled. This is a perfect example of the negative effect of mixing Quora and OCD.
Reassurance questions are addictive, like many things with OCD. It's terribly hard to stop. Once you get going, a lot of what you do seeks reassurance from someone, even if it's a stranger on Quora. If you intend to use Quora to ask these types of questions, or read answers to these kinds of things in order to receive reassurance about anything and everything, I don't recommend it. The more you continue, the more you won't be able to stop. Reassurance questions are harmful, and the more they happen the worse your OCD will get and the harder it will be to overcome it. Finding reassurance on Quora, for anything, may seem helpful, but it's doing more harm than good.
I'm sure there are more negative outcomes of mixing OCD and Quora, but this was something that immediately jumped to my mind because I myself experienced it. Trust me. You can't let the OCD overpower you. It will take effort and time, but you can be in control of it.
Besides that, though, Quora is a great place to be. It's fun and interesting, and you can learn plenty. If you intend on using it for fun and knowledge, go ahead! If you're curious about all kinds of things, even information about OCD, this is a great place for you. Just make sure you don't use it for things that will potentially ""increase"" your OCD and make things harder, because at the end of the day, it's not worth it.
Best of luck to you!",OCD
1004,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1005,"Yes we know. Well for us which have introspected. It is under control by medication, exercise and having empathy for your mind; also meditation helps. If you haven’t got patience and you have OCD, now is the time to learn how to sit with yourself. If you can’t do this, well it will be much harder. Once you realise your brain misfires you can manage it. It is just an annoying glitch which instigates anxiety within your body and creates a stress response, this is why some people such as myself enact very strange compulsions.",OCD
1006,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD
1007,"Good question. I've had OCD since I was a teenager. I didn't get the right diagnosis until in my 30's. I want you to know it's difficult to deal with.

The guilt in not being able to control this stuff is maddening. It's a viscous circle that keeps happening over and over. I've had many years of therapy and have regular visits with my psychiatrist for medication evaluation. There is no way I could of made the improvements unless I had the meds. Because they treat my brain chemistry. I have much progress on my actions, anxiety and intrusive thought because of my professional help. I could not have done this on my own.",OCD
1008,"It is possible for individuals with anxiety disorders such as OCD to overcome their obsessions without therapy or medication. However, the success of this approach may vary depending on the severity of the disorder and the individual's willingness to make lifestyle changes and actively work on managing their symptoms.
Some people may find relief through self-help techniques such as mindfulness, relaxation techniques, and cognitive-behavioral therapy techniques. These techniques can help individuals to identify and challenge their negative thoughts and behaviors and develop coping strategies to manage their obsessions.
It is important for individuals to seek support from loved ones and to create a supportive environment that promotes healthy habits and coping mechanisms. Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep can also help to reduce symptoms of anxiety.
However, it is important to note that therapy and medication can be effective tools in managing and overcoming anxiety disorders. It is recommended to seek professional help if symptoms are severe and impacting daily life.

1010,"Cured? No. Managed? Yes.
I have been actively combating my anxiety since I reached high school, and have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. It was bad enough that I went selectively mute for the entire 8th grade.
In high school, I started facing things that scared me, and noticed that I got better and better at these things the more I did them. It scared me in the moment. But the satisfaction afterwards, from confronting my fears and getting things done, that was like a high. I wanted to do more and more for myself. My teenage ambition to be independent came late, but it showed up.
The social anxiety was by no means cured, but it got lessened enough in the first two years of high school that I was able to make some school friends for the first time in my life, and I could talk to them. That was an achievement for me.
Then shit happened (it’s a long story), and a psychiatrist forced me to take anxiety medication. Those pills reversed everything I earned in under a semester.
This medication forced the physiological symptoms of happiness (there’s this feeling in my chest I get when I’m happy, and the drug simulated that all the time). Then it took control of my life.
What I did on those drugs was so bad, I don’t even want to mention the specifics. It was bad enough that all those “friends” I made were too embarrassed to be seen around me. The pills controlled me into losing my friends. Real life improvements for sure.
On top of that, the effect the drug had on my memory caused me to forget how to do all those things I had pushed myself to do before taking the drugs. I wasn’t happy inside, but had no control over myself during that time. The drugs chose everything, did everything.
But the pills couldn’t force me to take more. I stopped taking them entirely, facing withdrawal head-on.
It has been 3 years since that day, and I’ve gained back everything those pills took from me in the meantime. They slowed me down, and set me behind. At 20, I’m not quite all adult, but I’m close enough to say that I would have been if not for the pills. By this summer, when I turn 21, I’ll be able to say I live a normal life despite my anxiety.
Working on anxiety without medication is far closer to a cure than any pill. Hands down.",OCD

It’s different for everyone and not something i’d wish upon anyone. My mind was working overtime 24/7. But i’m glad that will power actually worked, because i didnt want medication.

1016,"OCD is by far the worst thing that has ever happened to me, and is most certainly debilitating. OCD isn't wanting to have tables lined up straight. It isn't wanting your pens in colour order. It isn't wanting to have a tidy room. OCD is a debilitating disorder that can take over your life, and is incredibly difficult to recover from.
OCD can manifest itself in so many ways, but it usually revolves around a set of phobias, or obsessions, that usually have a common factor. For me I feel the need to have control over every aspect of my environment in order to keep myself safe. I'm terrified of germs, bugs, and anything where I'm out of control or not myself, such as alcohol or carnival rides. Contact with any of these things used to make me feel overwhelmingly panicked.
It's not simply a matter of having a few phobias and avoiding them. They're called obsessions for a reason. You spend hours of your day thinking about how to avoid every thing that you obsess about. Then the compulsive side comes in. If you come into contact with any of these things that worry you, you then have to something to advert the danger you think you have put yourself in. It's not a choice, in your head it's a matter of life and death, removing this danger is necessary.
By giving into the compulsion you continue the cycle, where the only thing that help a certain obsession is to give into the compulsion. It's incredibly overwhelming, spending hours thinking about how to avoid a certain thing, going out of your way to avoid said thing, then when you inevitably come into contact with it having to do something awful to get rid of the panic.
For me my main obsession was germs. I had to about them at all costs. Otherwise I'd get sick and die. I'd only eat from dishes that had been washed in the dishwasher, because the sink water was filthy. I'd hold glasses up to the light to make sure they were clean. I'd get new cutlery if mine touched the table. I'd refuse to use my drink bottle ever again if anyone else drank from it. I refuse to swim in anything but the ocean. If anyone touched my toothbrush I'd start crying. I wouldn't hold on on the train, because people's dirty hands had touched the railing, instead I'd lean against the door in everyone's way. I had to make all my food fresh myself, so none of the ingredients were off. If I touched anything that worried me I'd scrub my hands with soap. Eventually my hands were cracked and raw from all the soap. I'd refuse physical contact with people, in case they were sick or hadn't washed their hands. This stuff was just the tip of the iceberg.
The social impact is also devastating, as no one wants to spend time with someone who has such intense anxiety around so much. You also drive your friends away, as you don't think they'd be any help. I know I ended up becoming depressed, feeling like so much was wrong with me and I had no one to go to. I'm a teenage girl, and so far I've never been in a relationship. I've been asked out by people I've liked, and I've wanted to ask people out, but if hugging a family member is worrying because of germs, the thought of kissing someone, let alone going any further is absolutely terrifying.
Then there's recovery. In order to recover from OCD you can have talk therapy or medication, often in combination. I was to scared to go on medication because I thought it might impact my thoughts to much and I'd stop being me. A method called cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT, is often used by psychologists. This basically involves exposing yourself to the exact thing that terrifies you in order to make it stop scaring you. Whatever your worst fear is think of it. Imagine having to expose yourself to it every single day, and feel that overwhelming fear that comes with that phobia in order to get better. Medication can help, but in the end without CBT you won't really get better. It's a horrible experience, trying so hard to go against everything your brain is telling you to do.
If you work incredibly hard eventually it does make a difference. You're less overwhelmed, and actually have the time to think about other things. As hard as CBT is, it certainly helps. But despite the fact it gets better you live in constant fear of relapse, of being miserable again, as without constant effort OCD can creep up on you again. And OCD isn't something you cure. It is something you learn to cope with, and work around in your life. You're not trying to get rid of OCD, sadly that's all but impossible, you're trying to get to a point where it doesn't interfere with your day to day happiness.
I hope from this you can see that despite the lack of obvious physical symptoms OCD is most certainly a debilitating disorder, that is able to seriously damage your way of life. And please, whatever you do, don't use OCD to describe your quirks, don't say you're so OCD about your pencils or your wardrobe. Hearing people describe your disorder as if it's a quirk to laugh about is devastating.",OCD
1017,"It for absolute positive. But I really do not think so especially in the manner of we spoof communicable diseases. It is and mental, cognitive emotional disorder and not a physical biological disease.
Is it “ catching “ as they say of like measles. No. But is it imitable. I think that it could be. But imitation of something is not the same as truly contracting an ailment.
There may be an atmosphere that may stimulate or foster. social behavior or misbehavior. But to actually say that it is communicable I personally do not believe so. It may seems so though.
I substitute taught and taught I. Some inner cities in which there were crowded classrooms. Some of the kids could not ever concentrate as others. Easy distracted. But then considering I was the substitute and they were young grammar school kids it gave the appearance that the OCD was being communicable to others. But then on the other hand there were several others that were deeply engaged in their class assignments and not being inattentive to their work.
So I maintain my thought that the answer is NO. NOT COMMUNICABLE from my exams opinion only.",OCD
1018,"No OCD is not a communicable disorder..
However. Growing up with someone with OCD, one can develop rigid behavioral patterns. Yet it is the irrational thought patterns and cognitive distortions that drive the intense compulsions. List are the common thinking errors otherwise referred to as cognitive distortions.
These distortions for people inflicted with OCD the act on them with compulsions
COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS
Cognitive distortions are exaggerated or irrational beliefs about oneself, the world, and the future. They are usually self-defeating and result in negative emotions (e.g., depression, anxiety, anger). Below are some common cognitive distortions.
1. Filtering: When using filtering, we magnify the negative details while filtering out all positive aspects of a situation. This cognitive distortion will produce automatic thoughts that reinforce negative feelings and explain away positive ones.
2. Polarized Thinking (or “Black and White” Thinking): In polarized thinking, things are either “black-or-white) with no shades of gray. We place people or situations in “either/or” categories. For example, we have to be perfect or we’re a failure-there is no middle ground.
3. Overgeneralization: When we overgeneralize, we come to a general conclusion based on a single incident or single piece of evidence. If something negative happens only once, we expect it to happen over and over again, in a never-ending pattern of defeat.
4. Jumping to Conclusions: This distortion involves making negative interpretations without any evidence or facts to support the conclusion. For example, a person may anticipate that things will turn out badly and will feel convinced that their prediction is already an established fact. There are two types: a) Mind Reading: arbitrary conclusion that someone is reacting negatively to you or has negative thoughts about you; and b) The Fortune Teller Error: anticipates things will turn out badly and convinced it is an established fact.
5. Catastrophizing: Catastrophizing involves expectations of the worst possible scenario. For example, we expect disaster to strike no matter what. You may find yourself worrying: “What if…?” the worst thing imaginable happens
6. Personalization: In personalization, we believe that everything others do or say is some kind of direct, personal reaction to us. It also involves comparing ourselves to others and trying to determine who is smarter, better looking, etc. It. involves expectations of the worst possible scenario. For example, we expect disaster to strike no matter what. You may find yourself worrying: “What if…?” the worst thing imaginable happens
7. Should Statements: Should statements are rigid rules about how we think things “should” be or how others “should” behave. People or events that break the rules make us angry, anxious, or depressed. “Musts” and “oughts” are also commonly distorted beliefs.
8. Global Labeling: This is an extreme form of Overgeneralization. It involves attaching a negative and unhealthy label to oneself or others based on a single situation. For example, saying “I am a horrible student” after one poor grade on a test or “he is a real jerk” after someone rubs you the wrong way.
9. Always Being Right: This distortion involves thinking that we must always be right and trying to prove that our opinions and actions are correct. Being wrong is unthinkable and we will go to any length to demonstrate our rightness.

1019,"If you mean to ask if it’s contagious like the flu then no, OCD is a mental illness and that happens within a person. Some people say genes play a role in it but no one actually knows how someone gets OCD, but I can assure you that you won’t get OCD from your friend lol.",OCD
1020,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
1021,"What do you mean by contagious? Like by hanging out with someone who has OCD, you may get it? If so, then no.",OCD
1022,"no it is not contagious, that would be considered mass hysteria (refers to an outbreak of unusual and uncharacteristic behaviors, thoughts and feelings, or health symptoms shared among a group of people)",OCD
1023,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

1025,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1027,"OCD is not the kind of a disorder that involves a so called cause to be exact. Even at this stage, scientists can only attribute it to a neuro chemical imbalance in the brain mainly due to alteration in the levels of neurotransmitters.
As for the treatment, like I mentioned it's not a disease or disorder that requires treatment except in severe anxiety associated OCD.
That being said , doctors usually recommend anti depressant drugs such as fluvoxetine(Prozac in US), fluvoxamine for the treatment of OCD, primarily because OCD is classified under neurotic disorders. However, these drugs come with a black box warning that these are suicidal ideation drugs so should be prescribed with great caution.

Think of it as uncontrolled activity in areas of the brain responsible for things such as habits, decision making, anticipation, and impulse control. This abnormal activity goes away after successful treatment with either drugs or therapy.
Another theory is that the individual has a lack of a sense of task completion about the obsessions/compulsions and that an innate brain function originally designed to keep us alive is refusing to shutdown. Therefore the individual feels compelled to repeat certain behaviors since completing the behavior once doesn't trigger a satisfying feeling of completion.",OCD
1031,"Understanding OCD is like peeling an onion – layers of complexity. While the exact cause remains a bit of a brainy riddle, scientists suspect it's a mixtape of brain chemistry, genetics, life experiences, and personality traits.
Picture this: your brain's serotonin dance party might hit a few off-beats, triggering those relentless thoughts and compulsive rituals. Plus, if OCD is your family's unwelcome guest, genetics could be slipping it an invite.
Life experiences add to the mix. Maybe a childhood of walking on eggshells or dealing with intense stress cranks up the OCD volume. It's like your brain's unique way of coping with the chaos.
Now, the good news – treatments are in the mental health toolkit:
1. Therapy Rhythms: Cue the spotlight on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the rockstar of OCD treatment. Think of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) as your therapist-guided jam session, gradually facing fears without the compulsive backup dancers.
2. Medication Magic: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) swoop in to regulate the serotonin party, dialing down the OCD volume. It's like a mental health DJ working behind the scenes.
3. Life's Chill Pill: Stress-busting techniques, relaxation tricks, and a solid sleep routine – these are the cool vibes that can help manage OCD symptoms.

1033,"I'm diagnosed OCD (30 years ago), and have made significant progress in dealing with it.
The cause(s) are probably some combination of heredity, environmental factors, and trauma. It's an “anxiety disorder,” in its basic sense: a person adopts repetitive behaviors in an attempt to reduce their feelings of anxiety - usually through distraction or doing something they think will improve their situation but it interferes with their ability to function normally.
In my situation, the medication “Zolaft” was the biggest game-changer in my life. I also did extensive behavioral therapy. But, the right medication made the biggest difference, by far. I had a lot of intense, long-term therapy to deal with my OCD. But, it completely disrupted the trajectory of my entire life. Basically, it took the entire decade of my 20's to deal with it.

And usually once someone gets one of them, and with this case OCD, because the mind has been essentially reprogrammed to operate a certain way to try and defend itself from taking further damage, the negative symptoms that come with OCD, I believe in the end actually cause more damage to the mind, which creates more mental disorders.",OCD

How does OCD interfere with someone’s life? OCD can severely impact a person’s life in multifaceted ways. Left untreated, OCD can lead to other severe mental health conditions, such as anxiety and panic attacks, and depression. Untreated mental health conditions are also a significant source of drug and alcohol addiction. People will often turn to drugs or alcohol to cope with the distress of an untreated mental disorder. For people with OCD, compulsions can take up hours of a person’s time. They can miss school, work, and their personal and professional relationships can suffer under the weight of an untreated mental health condition. People with untreated OCD often isolate themselves from others. Intrusive, disturbing thoughts, and the pressure and subsequent exhaustion that a person feels after performing compulsions leads them to isolate themselves socially. Social isolation makes it harder for people to seek help from others and may prolong the negative impacts of the disease. OCD can also cause someone to avoid certain situations or places that can trigger an obsession. Isolation and loneliness can lead to depression. Suffering from untreated OCD can cause feelings of powerlessness, and loss of control. It is common for sufferers of OCD and their loved ones to experience anger related to the disorder. Family members and friends who do not understand the disease may blame the sufferer, which can also fuel the cycle of isolation, loneliness, and depression. Resentment on behalf of the sufferer and loved ones can also prevent the OCD sufferer from getting the help they need. For people with OCD, their family members may not understand that it is a treatable mental disorder. There is a risk that loved ones may engage in enabling behaviors. Enabling behaviors prevent the person with OCD from realizing how severe the condition is, and from seeking help. In these types of cases, family therapy can be extremely beneficial for breaking enabling behavior patterns and getting the OCD sufferer the support they need to manage the condition. The anxiety, pressure, and exhaustion inherent in OCD can lead to a host of physical health issues. For example, obsessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, or lead to a serious infection. OCD sufferers may wash their hair so frequently that they develop lesions or other scalp issues that can become infected. They may lose precious sleep performing rituals, which can negatively impact their immune system and cause their personal and professional life to suffer.

OCD: Some Facts | Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety | Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania
OCD: Some Facts Symptoms It is estimated that six million people in the USA have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Men and women develop OCD at similar rates and it has been observed in all age groups, from school-aged children to older adults. OCD typically begins in adolescence, but may start in early adulthood or childhood. The onset of OCD is typically gradual, but in some cases it may start suddenly. Symptoms fluctuate in severity from time to time, and this fluctuation may be related to the occurrence of stressful events. Because symptoms usually worsen with age, people may have difficulty remembering when OCD began, but can sometimes recall when they first noticed that the symptoms were disrupting their lives. As you may already know, the symptoms of OCD include the following: Unwanted or upsetting doubts Thoughts about harm, contamination, sex, religious themes, or health Rituals like excessive washing, checking, praying, repeating routine activities Special thoughts designed to counteract negative thoughts In addition, you may be aware of certain situations, places, or objects that trigger the distressing thoughts and urges to ritualize. You may find yourself avoiding these situations, places, and objects. What causes OCD? The reasons why some people develop obsessions and compulsions while others don't are unknown. Researchers have considered different types of explanations. Some experts have suggested that some specific ""thinking mistakes"" about harm occur in OCD. Examples of such thinking mistakes are: Thinking about an action is the same as doing it, or wanting to do it People should control their thoughts If I don’t try to prevent harm, it’s the same as causing harm A person is responsible for harm, regardless of the circumstances While this theory explains the types of thinking mistakes made by people with OCD, it does not explain why some people develop OCD and others do not. Many researchers also feel that people with OCD have abnormal brain chemistry involving serotonin , a chemical that is important for brain functioning. Unusual serotonin chemistry has been observed in people with OCD and medications that relieve OCD symptoms also change serotonin levels. However, it is not known whether serotonin chemistry is truly a key factor in the development of OCD. Research results are inconclusive at this point. There is also evidence that OCD is more prevalent in some families than others. It is difficult to know how much of this is a result of what children learn from their family while growing up, and how much is hereditary. Why do you have OCD? Many people would like to know what causes this disorder or how they developed it. There are a number of guesses, but there is as yet no satisfactory theory of its development. Most likely, there is a combination of factors (such as biological/genetic and environmental aspects) that contribute to the development of OCD. It is tempting to be overly concerned with the lack of information ab

1042,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
1043,"OCD is a response to anxiety. It develops when one has no other way to deal with compulsive thoughts of danger. When it becomes so severe that one cannot live a normal life, it still will not harm the brain.
The main brain component of OCD is the slow depletion of serotonin which is supposed to help deal with stress. With less and less serotonin, which is destroyed by cortisol, the stress hormone, one is triggered by less and less severe moments of anxiety.
The compulsion to do a number of unrelated gestures or sounds is a temporary relief and when one finds a natural or medical way to decrease the anxiety, the compulsions will also decrease, and the brain will not change in one or the other case.
If you suffer OCD, it is plenty enough anguish that you don’t also need to think you are harming your brain. The brain is resilient and exists to help you.",OCD
1044,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD

if the OCD is channeled properly, then it’s a huge asset. Working as an upholsterer, which requires insane amounts of attention to details, is an optimal placement for this skill set.
I’m stuck behind a desk at a retail position, there will be frustration if i don’t have an appropriate outlet for it. I survived my time working as a dispatcher at a busy midtown IT company, by using my lunch breaks to smoke pot and teach myself to juggle.

1047,"Generally, Cognitive Behaviour therapies (CBT) for OCD are exposure based. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the recommended CBT treatment for OCD. The treatment generally involves a therapist guiding a person with OCD to expose themselves, in a graded way, to the anxiety and discomfort associated with their obsessions WITHOUT acting on them. So if a person with contamination-fear based OCD is having an urge to wash their hands, they refrain COMPLETELY from doing so and instead sit with the discomfort and anxiety. The therapist VERY IMPORTANTLY also guides the person to block all other substitute behaviours that they might feel the urge to do when they are refraining from hand-washing. If this is not done, the treatment will not be successful. Through repeating the above process many many times, the person’s anxiety and discomfort gradually comes down substantially along with their urges to perform their compulsive physical or mental behaviours. The person learns that the catastrophic outcome that they fear could occur either doesn't occur or is very unlikely.
As you can probably imagine, the exposure treatment is no easy feat as the person with OCD has to be willing and FULLY committed to face the anxiety and discomfort that comes with not acting on their obsessions, and they must be willing to refrain from their compulsive behaviours, whether this is handwashing or repeatedly mentally counting to 10. If the person is not able or willing to make this commitment then therapy will most likely be terminated.
There are self-help books available to support people with OCD to treat themselves but these will only be helpful if the person is extremely commuted and motivated to refrain from acting on their obsessions. Also because new and sometimes very subtle compulsive behaviours show up when a person refrains from engaging in one compulsive behaviour, having a therapist is sometimes necessary. OCD exposure treatment only works when ALL compulsive behaviours are blocked.",OCD
1048,"Yes, OCD therapies are effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of symptoms when performed by a trained professional and when the person with OCD is motivated to change and willing to try and put in the commitment required.
Cognitive and behavioral therapies have shown better results at helping both children and adults with OCD than that of medications. These therapies can also be combined with medications.
Though medication and therapy are the primary weapons against OCD, learning and practicing relaxation techniques can go a long way in treating the condition. Deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation are some ways in which one can devise a self-help strategy.",OCD
1049,"Yes, when you are trying to direct your life from fear, you become compulsive, etc. It is acting out from the lack of accepting “ Thy Will Be Done.” I can not play God, or protect me, I have to surrender to the love of the universe for my needs to be met and I can rest in the presence of love. give up your fears, resentments, and anger to allow your heart to open and fill you with love and direct your way.
In the last few days, I found out more about my OCD which caused me a big concern. I found it comes from me from trying to be perfect as I always felt I was less then others. If I am perfect maybe I would be loved and liked.
This is also called pride or wearing a mask to look good to others when inside I am totally distraught trying to be part of life. I had to get honest with myself and release the pride which is a false cover and drop the mask to look good and feel that I am good enough to others. My actions did not support the real me that always has been good enough in God’s eyes and love me with all my short comings.",OCD
1050,"I got possessed by some unseen supernatural powers when I was young. Hailing from a decent family, everyone including myself thought it to be a psychiatric issue and sought help from my uncle who was a neurosurgeon. Even after 6 months of meds, my condition never improved. I felt drugged all the time due to severe side effects of the psychiatric meds I had been prescribed. Belonging to a hindu family, I was taken to a saint who was a Krishnaa devotee. He treated me with holy water , asked me to chant Lord Hanuman's name (god's name) in meditation. Though it took 5-6 months , but finally I got treated.
As pointed out by the saint, the reasons for possession are->1) Not being chaste/ celibate
2) Eating meat & non-veg food, which are the foods of ghosts/ jinns/ bad spirits
3) Not meditating on God's name, which is the biggest deterrent against possession and invisible powers
[One can chant any God's name of his/her religion/faith, but should be done in meditation with eyes closed to see instant effect. The longer one does it, the more benefit one will see(min 15 minutes a day). Also strict physical celibacy is needed; else meditation on God won't show results]
The Mental disorders that I got rid of after following the above rules->
1) Heavy head
2) Sleeplessness/ severe insomnia- I could not sleep for 8-10 months in a row & no meds could make me fall asleep either
3) Vivid nightmares , which occurred every time I tried to sleep. [Bad supernatural powers cause bad dreams, like falling from cliff, you/ family members getting killed]
4) Shouting violently when asleep even for a moment
5) Throwing arms & legs in dreams
THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS MOSTLY CAUSE MENTAL DISORDERS , WHICH RESEMBLE A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. SO ITS DIFFICULT TO DETECT.
According to the saint, jinns/spirits are in the form of air in this world & are invisible to humans on an average spiritual level . (But once a person comes on a very high spiritual level through strict 'celibacy' & meditation on God over lifetime, he/she attains spiritual powers to see these evil creatures) . Also, these jinns/spirits can attack only the people at low/average spiritual level (ie, who are not chaste/ don't meditate on God's names), that means, they can attack almost everyone on earth, as most of us don't lead a spiritual life. They attach themselves to the person's nervous system as well as circulatory system. They tend to play with the two organs- brain & heart.
The reason for attachment is to get Pleasure out of your body. So, to get pleasure , these powers first enter your physical body via air & once inside the lungs, move into circulatory system and attach themselves to heart, brain, spinal cord etc. Once attached to your body, they get the pleasure that you're getting through food etc (So celibacy is a strict criteria as these creatures like sex pleasures through one's body).
Possession varies ( the % of body getting possessed), & thus can be classified into partial possession and complete possession. Partial possession if not controlled through strict celibacy & meditation will surely move to a full possession in which the possessed person will lose entire control over his body & mind.
Also possession never starts from full directly; it always progress from slight to partial to complete. However , if one reached to a complete possession state, the jinn/spirit has complete command over your body & can do/say anything through your body. In that case, the victim's claims of seeing other beings, creatures, etc. is not what the victim sees, but what actually the spirit sees
After going through the possession, I now believe in both science and spirituality. It has made me much stronger. I also cracked CAT in my first attempt & converted 3 of the IIMs (prestigious MBA college in India).
Also , I've extensively written this article so that anyone who faces any such issue , easily identifies the same & applies the above remedies to his/her benefit. :) :)",OCD
1051,"alright. i’ve seen and interacted with some pretty crazy shit in my time but don’t ever, EVER tell someone with a mental disorder, especially one like OCD or schizophrenia, that they’re possessed by a demon. this can cause people serious harm. you can, privately, believe whatever you like. but don’t tell them there’s something evil inside of them and don’t try to get it out because it won’t work.
and when it doesn’t work, they’ll believe they’re what’s evil, and they may end up thinking they’re the one that’s got to go. don’t do this! ever!",OCD
1052,"While I am not a psychologist I can tell you my personal opinion and experience says yes. Being Buddhist we speak much about this. I think if you read a bit about Buddhism, specifically Tibetan Buddhism you will find that this is a root belief. One can go further in says it is not only a belief or theory but fact. I will not attempt to argue that but I will try to explain it.
At my Temple we have had Many doctors attend on various occasions. They are more open minded to Buddhist philosophy than in the past.
In Buddhism we have 31 planes of existence. The Thirty-one Planes of Existence
There are Hellish realms, ghostly realms, animal realms, our realm known as the plane of desire, and higher realms as well.
The realm in which we reside, is the 5th of 31. The goal or belief is to avoid rebirth which would have us return to this realm. Rebirth is not the same as reincarnation. It is also possible that we descend into a lower realm due to anger, aggression, desire or other bad thoughts and practices.
If you think about it, in our everyday life desire has a lot to do with all that runs society Globally. I generally say Psychology is the most powerful agent in society.
It is most often about what we want. What we seek. We desire, pleasure, calm, and being content and happy.
Companies use advertisements to try to persuade you to purchase their products, they use psychology in doing so. Just as someone running for a position of power desires your vote, they use psychology to try and earn your vote. This is all based on desire.
There are many other examples, but if you look around we always desire. It is hard to avoid. What can happen with OCD is one becomes obsessive in what they can not have. Be it a situation, a feeling, an object or anything else. Desire feeds desire. This is a feedback loop and a cycle that is difficult to break. Suffering and desire generally go hand in hand.
From a Buddhist perspective this is one of the more difficult challenges we often face. This is why we practice meditation. There are many forms of meditation. The one that has the most benefit is the empty mind. Concentration on nothing, clearing all thoughts and purging our subconscious of these thoughts has a lasting effect.
These are techniques used by some psychologist, generally as part of CBT, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
It does work however as with anything it requires effort. So often now we want to take a pill and change the chemistry of our brain to solve a mind issue. In some cases that may be the only solution so I never disagree with that. It is however important to try to resolve issues with other approaches that do not require medication or a combination of both.
From a Christian perspective, yes it there is also a spiritual component as well. There are many verses that speak of different desire and obsession in the Bible. I lean a bit more toward the Catholic perspective on this ( while today that may seem like a contradiction in terms. LOL).
Any good Priest would speak to great length about this topic as it is one that is embedded in just about every religion.
Is a spiritual approach the correct approach? Well not for everyone. It really depends on the person. From a Buddhist perspective we believe to live is to suffer, we want to avoid that, but we must accept it.
I would not try to push a spiritual solution upon anyone that is not spiritual, it will not work. The person has to be open minded and willing to accept this into their therapy.

I think in the end the answer to your question is it depends. It depends on the person. Each Religion or Philosophy will say yes in almost every case. That however does not mean that each and every person will accept that. Is that wrong? No, An atheist would say , your crazy just go to a good psychiatrist and try the medication he prescribes. And , that has worked fine for some.
I do believe it is important to find yourself and understand what you believe and have faith in. That can be an important cornerstone to the success of any treatment be it for addiction, behavioral issues or just life in general.
I hope that helps, that is just my thoughts for what they are worth.",OCD
1053,"While entity attachment can cause a number of bizarre and annoying conditions OCD is not one I’ve ever seen due to that cause, and I have worked in this realm for 4 decades. Not to say it couldn’t be. Entity attachment is fairly common with addictions of all types, and I’ve seen it induce strong negative emotions such as anger, irritability, and terror among others. Usually with entity attachments there are other symptoms besides the main symptom such as inner voices and feeling spacey.",OCD
1054,"Are there spiritual/metephysical explanations for everything? Is that a question for teachers? Seekers? Metaphysicians? Psychologists? Psychiatrists? Theologians? Scientists? Philosophers?
And would it be remiss if we answer it one way and thus render the answer unusable for tbe other? Would that even be a question that would interest the others?
Would it spark a discussion that would be helpful to the one that has been diagnosed with the maladaption? The one who struggled through the chaos of their social milieu, only seeking order. The one who doubting their own ability, they sought to bring order to those mundane objects and social rituals as they could because they were so unsure of their abilities to function in “normal” situations that leave so much undone?
Would not a better way be to try to understand those others who like you only desire to help those so afflicted? What I have observed in my lifetime is the same result using different resources, managed by varying nomenclature, varying terminology or identical terms with varying meanings, determined and developed by good people speaking different languages. Different professional jargon, with very specific, very narrow, meaning.

1055,"To say it as simply ad possible I feel OCD is the universe trying to communicate with you and use you as a vessel to give information, formulas, invention and such out to others as everything is connected through energy the universe is frequency, vibration, and energy. Everything is math from the composition of DNA that makes life to the composition of 0's amd 1's that create programs for computers. For example there was always a cloud storage the person who founded it was the vessel but these things are hidden in plan site we are the vessels that unveil it for others. Tesla had OCD I believe it was 1 of his supper powers. Would he have been gifted as he was without it?",OCD
1056,"No. OCD is a learned disorder. It can be cured by psychiatric treatment.
It is time we stop believing in spirits/possession in this modern world. Your question uses the word ""spiritual"" is a wrong meaning. Spiritual has nothing to do with ghosts and spirits.",OCD
1057,"Does OCD (Obsessive Compulsive disorder) have a spiritual dimension?
I would say so, yes — if you are willing to see it in this way.
OCD is experienced as a lack of autonomy, helplessness, the feeling of having no choice or power, the feeling of being forced — compulsion.
“I feel like I just have to do these things, even if I don’t want to.”
“If I don’t keep re-locking the door, it just doesn’t feel safe.”
It is also experienced as doubt.
“Did I lock that window? … I did, but it doesn’t feel locked, let me lock it again.”
“Are my hands clean? I just washed them, but they don’t feel clean. Are they really clean? Let me wash them again.”
The experience of autonomy—or not—and the experience of doubt, clearly have a spiritual dimension, no?
Who has not wrestled with the question of whether or not we have choice or free will, the degree to which our behavior is determined?
Who has not wrestled with doubt in God or in spiritual realities, in general?
The particular emotional syndrome, of which OCD is an exaggerated manifestation, is very similar to what one experiences during a spiritual crisis. However the “spiritual version” of OCD, if I can talk about it that way, is less robotic, more refined, more heady/hearty as opposed to the behavioral syndrome that is OCD.
Look at an insect, perfectly programmed like an OCD victim. Whatever its program tells it to do, it does. I am hard pressed to believe that insects have any experience of autonomy.
Look at a human—filled to the brim with the experience of autonomy (whether or not they have it, absolutely). Yet frequently finding that in practice, their habits and programming make them feel almost robotic.
Do we have autonomy, or not?
Is there a God? And if so, do I have any choice?
Is it All God? And if so, is my choice an illusion?
Are we forced, or is there true Freedom?
These are potent spiritual questions.
May all sufferers of OCD feel these powerful questions in their heart and make maximal value of their affliction!",OCD
1058,"Howdy Sean,
I’m not sure if anyone is following this anymore. But I feel that I might be able to help as I have suffered with OCD for many years and have made significant progress in the last 6 months.
I have read so many articles and watched countless videos on the topic of enlightenment as well as other psychology and spiritual material trying to find answers, which in some ways has contributed to the sufffering that I have gone through because there are a lot of different points of views and beliefs etc.
Having said that, I cannot comment on enlightentment and if you will achieve it or if I will, because I haven’t experienced it yet. But from what I have read and viewed, they do say that enlightenment is total dis identification with thought. Not meaning that you no longer have thoughts, you’re just no longer effected by them in a suffering way.
I, myself have found something that really does work, as Jon mentioned above, and that is awareness and where you place your attention.
I have found that every thought that I have automatically grabs my attention because for so many years, being identified with thinking, every thought has been important. They’re not, trust me on that. So basically what I do is when I become aware of a thought coming up, I accept that it is there, and divert my attention to the feeling of my breathing in my nostrils. If there is any feeling (emotions or slight pain) in my body, I allow them to be there without resisting them or judging them in any way at all.
The thing is, whatever you resist, will persist. So if you have a thought process that you don’t like, and you think, I don’t want this, or why am I experiencing these thoughts. They will continue, because you are feeding them more energy by thinking about them. But if you acknowledge that they have come up, don’t judge them and see them as only a thought and gently divert your attention to your breathing, they eventually get the picture that there is no need for them to be there. I have released a lot of thought process that I use to have that use to control me.
I will be honest with you, some days are harder than others because as I said earlier, thoughts have a way of being seductive and pulling your attention in, but if you remind yourself to divert your attention back to the breathing, then you’re doing amazing each time and making progress to dis identifying with your thoughts.
I also believe that most of our thought patterns, we have learnt from everyone else and can be unlearnt as well. because at one point in our lives, we weren’t thinking some of the horrible shit that we think now. but those people we learnt how to think from, they done the same thing from others that they trusted and it goes on and on and on. No-one is at fault. it is all unconscious learning of useless beliefs, opinions and views of the way things are or how they should be, when in reality, everything is as it is. Simple
Anyway, I hope this helps somewhat :)",OCD
1059,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions). To get rid of the thoughts, they feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing/cleaning, checking on things, and mental acts like (counting) or other activities, can significantly interfere with a person’s daily activities and social interactions.
Many people without OCD have distressing thoughts or repetitive behaviors. However, these do not typically disrupt daily life. For people with OCD, thoughts are persistent and intrusive, and behaviors are rigid. Not performing the behaviors commonly causes great distress, often attached to a specific fear of dire consequences (to self or loved ones) if the behaviors are not completed. Many people with OCD know or suspect their obsessional thoughts are not realistic; others may think they could be true. Even if they know their intrusive thoughts are not realistic, people with OCD have difficulty disengaging from the obsessive thoughts or stopping the compulsive actions.
Being uncomfortable or distressed around contaminated or unclean areas is way different from OCD. OCD is a serious condition that can be extremely challenging to live with on a daily basis. That being said, the most common type of OCD is obsessions and compulsions that revolve about contamination and germs. That’s the correlation between contamination and OCD.",OCD
1060,"I have found that since being diagnosed when I was 14 until my current age 41. Checking has robbed me of so much time, while giving me so much stress. OCD among other names has been called a “time thief.” That is true. I have been treated with almost every medication, tms, erp, mindfulness. I still suffer this condition. I live a life of sudden mental torture followed by physical torture on top.
i have never been able to beat the compulsion of checking things, the list is to long.
However it has made me late, caused panic attacks, made me lash out at people I care about. I know it will just come back as a thought at any given moment that will cause the compulsion. All the things I have missed, all the stolen time. These are things I will never get back.
Remember, another thing OCD constantly whispers in sufferers ears: “Are you sure?” And the cycle starts again.
thanks for reading I would appreciate some thumbs up.",OCD
1061,"From my experiences, I can safely say that everything that has to do with my OCD, is because I’m afraid of something. In your case, it’s most likely getting dirty and getting a disease or getting infected with something. This may or may not work for you, but remember that germs and bacteria are everywhere. Whether you like it or not, you have trillions of bacteria on you at all times. Coming into contact with a school kid isn’t nearly as bad as touching a public desk, door handles, even your own bathroom sink have way more germs than some kid you accidently bumped into while walking in the hallways. Therefore, my advice would be to not care!!! I know that this is easier said than done, especially if your OCD is as bad as mine, but just hear me out. Whenever you have that feeling of dread when you come into contact with a kid or something else you find dirty, do not act on it. Embrace that feeling and hold on to it until it eventually passes. Don’t try to not think about because we both know that makes it worse. If this doesn’t work for you, I would definitely see a psycotherapist or something similar, as 6 months is a terribly long time to be struggling with OCD. There you may learn your own techniques to help cope . I know it helped me and it may help you too.
Hang in there!

1062,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by repetitive, unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and irrational, excessive urges to do certain actions (compulsions).
OCD of chemical contamination is basically a fear for chemicals. When a person has OCD of chemical contamination, this is the way he thinks : “ My rational mind tells me ,that I have chemistry lessons in the lab where I am exposed to chemicals like the acids and bases. Since it is a school lab, the acids are not very concentrated and will not do much harm to me. However,of course, OCD being OCD tells me differently. OCD tells me that I am heavily contaminated every time I leave the lab as I will always some how accidentally get some acid on my hands. ( we dont use gloves by the way). OCD tells me that the chemicals have seeped through my skin into the bloodstream and harm me. Even I feel that my pens and pencils are contaminated and refuse to touch them. I used to also have a fear of chemicals in household products like the floor cleaner, glass cleaner as well.”",OCD
1063,"I probably would not use the word fear. I would use the word anxious.
My most debilitating triggers are usually related to contamination.
They generate a lot of mental noise for me if I am not careful. When I am escalated I can become very irrational. Usually the focuses is just getting away from it or cleaning any place that has come in contact with it. Depending on type of contamination I may need to just get rid of things that came in contact with the contamination.
There are some places that have potential for more contamination than others and there can be some dread associated with the anxiety in these situations. I can loose my appetite when I am escalated. It is common to experience physical reactions that are associated with shutting down.
For me, Depression is not so much related to contamination as it is with OCD in general. I think it is common to experience self loathing because of OCD. This can lead to depression if one is not careful.
Of course this is why we with OCD want to find a therapist that specializes in anxiety disorders and makes sense for us as individuals.
I find aversion therapy particularly useful for contamination triggers.",OCD

1065,I get freaked out. I cover my face. I try not to touch things that I deem infected. I no longer hug people. I will be paranoid if someone coughs or sneezes on me. If someone tells me it's fine or I have nothing to worry about it doesn't help at all. It's easier if people just let me be me when I'm trying to avoid germs. If I am interrupted during my compulsions or put in a situation I can't relax myself it's not going to go well. So nothing's going to help me not be worried about germs.,OCD

I suffer from OCD as well <3 i’m gonna give you the hard truth. one of the worst things you can do is take a food safety course. don’t listen to the other reply. it will only make you more conscious, anxious, and think too much of things you previously didn’t. its also just very obviously an intense compulsion response. the thing about our OCD is it’s a self doubt disorder at it’s core. as much as we try to alleviate it with compulsions it will never be enough. i cannot stress that enough. we have to sit in our discomfort and learn that the uncertainty is okay, that our brain is a bully. instead of judging a thought- labeling it good or bad- we let it exist. instead of avoiding our thoughts saying why do we feel this/ i never want to feel this/ i hate this, we let it exist. after letting it exist… we don’t engage. this means we don’t do our compulsions. we don’t self soothe, we don’t ask for reassurance, we don’t check, we don’t look stuff up, etc. it’s helpful to make a 0–100 list, called a SUD scale or Subjective Unit of Distress, on what is least to most distressing. this is a large scale SUD. you write your zero (mine is alone in my room writing music)… pure peace… your 100, 25, 75, and any thing else that needs to fit in. this is for subtypes. an example from me is checking 25, morality 100, and somatic 75. start small, & as you don’t engage in your thoughts you will also slowly do what you’re afraid of. this means a good start for what you’re experiencing could be not checking any expiration labels, or maybe not smelling food to make sure it’s bad. you can pick one, or if you have an understanding of what’s best for you to start w/ ofc do that instead. an intense example could be a loved one making you a meal you like, you cannot watch, you have to eat it with a blindfold, and you cannot ask for reassurance. this is obviously extreme and would be worked up to. while doing any exposures, check in with your “SUD” scale. if you’re constantly feeling at 100 most intense anxiety while doing this, go smaller. if you keep feeling 25, go larger. you will do this every day and check your SUD before and after you practice this. when practicing these exposures, vocalize your thoughts out loud (i know this feels kinda silly). when you do this it’s without judgment words; this is helpful because it slows down our thoughts astronomically. this is exposure response prevention therapy or ERP! :) it’s the best proven treatment for OCD. our OCD is treatable, it can in fact go away. it will ebb and flow. it’s not easy, ERP is a skill we build <3 best of luck to you",OCD
1067,"You would be lucky if you only did it poorly.
If you are an exceptionally disciplined person who is uniquely self -aware, you might be able to achieve mediocrity at best.
It’s just hard to treat OCD by yourself, especially at first. There is probably an algorithm that could go something like: for every year of useful therapy it becomes a little easier by a few points.
Mental health conditions are hard. OCD is complicated and nuanced and needs not just a professional but a specialist in anxiety. I won't say it's impossible, but no matter how much energy you put into it, that same amount of energy will go significantly farther when guided by someone who is trained and experienced.
Depending on the severity, there is also a risk that things can get worse. It would be unfortunate if the poorly used energy could have been more efficiently used and prevented someone from spinning out of control. Some research suggests there is a higher suicide rate among people with OCD. That outcome would of course be more than just unfortunate.",OCD
1068,"So basically I have contamination OCD amongst other things. It started with constantly feeling like things were dirty and needing to be cleaned which I felt was OKAY. It started to become a problem when I couldn’t get dressed without washing my hands for 15 minutes a day and was late for work, staying up late doing doing laundry (every night), taking 50 minute showers and using all of the soap available, losing sleep and basically interfering with my whole life. I couldn’t stop doing things and would cry and get upset everyday. Once it becomes that level it’s impossible to stop and requires treatment.",OCD
1069,"There are some general strategies that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often find helpful. However, it's essential to consult with a mental health professional.
Here are some coping strategies:
1.Seek Professional Help: Reach out to a therapist or counselor experienced in treating OCD. They can provide you with guidance, support, and evidence-based therapies.
2.Educate yourself: Knowing the mechanisms behind the disorder can help you develop coping strategies.
3.Manage Stress: Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as regular exercise, engaging in hobbies, practicing relaxation techniques, and getting enough sleep.
4.Challenge Obsessions: Work with your therapist to identify and challenge the irrational beliefs or obsessions that fuel your compulsive behaviors.
5.Limit Rituals Gradually: Instead of quitting compulsive behaviors cold turkey, try to gradually reduce the frequency and intensity of your rituals. This process can be done in collaboration with your therapist.
6.Create a Support System: Share your struggles with friends and family who can provide encouragement.
Remember that OCD is a treatable condition, and with the right support and strategies, you can manage its impact on your life.

1070,"It is necessary to know what OCD that is bothering you? Is it food or a particular behavior or set of conditions or what. Some common types of OCD’s:
worrying too much about someone’s illness, fetish of cleanliness, pangs of childlessness, fears of safety, afraid of committing mistakes, unwanted intrusive thoughts, compulsiveness, certain situations and many more. But you get the drift.
The brain is the seat of any OCD and it manifests in the subject's behavior. Living with this behavior, which may appear and take hold of the person for long periods or many short duration of this compulsive behavior that causes severe anxiety and interferes with your daily life in many ways. It is like an audio tape that is stuck at one point and whenever that point explodes in your face your brain is bombarded with a set of thoughts, images, speech patterns and personas in certain cases lessons which play in your mind at that moment. The moment can be short or long but it more often a cause of embarrassment. This embarrassment is known to you and only those who are aware of your OCD. This results in anxiety which overrides your brain’s alarm.
At moments you know that your anxieties are really not real and it makes no sense but for you it is very real. is your brain lying to you? Is your brain deceiving you? If your brain is lying then chances are that you have OCD. Further, your (sanity) warning system is not working. Obsessions are behaviors in the form of thoughts, images and impulses that are outside your control. Today brain scans can surface (showing imagery of different parts of the brain) that can establish presence of OCD’s.
But it is also a fact that OCD people do not want these obsessions that triggers anxieties. They are disturbing to the OCD person because he/she does not want it. They (the OCD people) find it discomforting and disturbing because they do not make any sense. Take the case of the OCD (things must be done in a certain way and that is the only way and hence the right way). If things are not done that way they arouse fear, disgust and doubt in people. The “Right Way” is more often than not notional. To stake a lot on this is an OCD. A normal/non OCD person will say it but not put a stake in the ground. Another time, another place and get along with life. Being Right for an OCD person takes a heavy mental health toll and living in that belief adds to psychological disorders and obsessive personality distractions.
It is also a fact that everyone has some OCD’s but not strong or disturbing ones that can lead to personality damages. Most people know when they exhibit one and quickly observe it and get over it and move on. But, if you feel you are much too obsessed and your insistence of your “Right Way” is damaging your mental health you need to be counseled by an expert who can conclusively establish you have OCD. Cure or its management is the next part.
Since OCD is something to do with the brain or if you like a grander word “mind”. you need to work towards getting to control your brain and mind. (I use the words interchangeably, though in the strictest sense they are not). In my experience and general observations on life the best way to get control over your mind is by the practice of meditation. There are many ways to meditate. Talk with someone knowledgeable and find important forms/ways of meditation. Try and i am sure you will find that meditation that suits you most. You can try Vipasana. i have wonderful outcomes.
whether your OCD will interfere with your married life? Think about your OCD, maybe try meditating for a couple of weeks. instinctively I can say with pretty good confidence that your OCD is more damaging in your imagination than it actually is. If it was not so you would not be seeking an answer here.
good Luck. Cheers",OCD
1071,"I don’t know you, but I just wanted to say that God loves you and he’s put a desire in your heart to be married and have children that is definitely from him. Perfect love casts out all fear and he also desires to give health to us emotionally, mentally and spiritually.

1072,"Possible. My kid carries most of my negative traits. He is also less able to deal with them and he's in his mid 20’s.
The world understands more and there is less stigma, but mental healthcare is actually worse now than in the 80’s back when there wasn't any SSRIs and there was more stigma about mental illness.
Odd, isn't it? They didn't have terms like ADD or OCD back then at least that i knew about. I never heard of a panic attacks. They were called nervous breakdowns.
Yet, with all this acceptance and new categorization, it has done little to improve things.
Let me give you an example. In the early 80s, my psychiatrist and and counselor per see was the same person. Now, I have a medical management person and a counselor. Both who never talk to one another despite my urging them to. Honestly, they both suck. I tell my medical management what i want to try and she writes it. There hasn't been much i have yet to try. It all fits the same thing. Very little (for me).
Second: diagnosis and neuropsychologic testing use to be the norm. Now, it is the exception. The result? You get a lot of people with light asbergers being misdiagnosed and…. Well everyone's is misdiagnosed nowadays. Go two five psychiatrist, you'll get probably three different diagnosis.
Lastly, we have concentrated too much on creating safe places, removing obstacles and adversity that may fail to teach important life lessons like how to stand up to a bully. We have many children with very low self esteem. A low self esteem is dangerous.
So, to answer your question…I couldn't say unless you and your spouse are discussing about having children now. Sometimes concerning yourself with far off future subjects is pointless. Stay present.
Regarding children, You probably won't have much to say about the situation anyhow. I know I didn't. It kind of just happens.",OCD
1073,"I’m a mother and I have OCD.
Actually edit that: I’m a great mother and I also happen to have OCD.
There are many forms of OCD people can have. I have it and quite frankly it’s exhausting. I have my repetitive rituals I do every single day and night. I have to do them. At least I feel I do…
Lily Carter's answer to What impact does OCD have on your daily life?
I mean I logically know that if I don’t tap my foot two times before leaving my son’s room at night nothing bad will happen. I know that if I don’t touch certain random objects 4 times or change the direction of the milk jug just so no matter how many times, that bad and ominous things won’t happen. I realize if everything isn’t done at an even number at my house, that bad luck isn’t sure to follow. Touching the door knob or faucet repeatedly till it feels right isn’t necessary. I do all these things and so much more daily…I know logically it’s not necessary. But the OCD part of myself will cause me extreme anxiety or I will get nauseous at the thought of not doing it. That bad things will for sure happen if I don’t do these things. I’ll have a panic attack or I’ll throw up. It’s easier to just do these things quickly and move on. But, I’m still a great mother.
My son gets genuine love and affection every single day by both myself and his dad. He loves the park and making friends. He loves to help me cook and bake weekly. Our refrigerator and pantry is always full of everything he could ever want to eat. I read books with him every single day. We play together everyday. His closet and dresser is filled with clean clothes and he has more clothes than I do in fact. He earns an allowance. He does chores. He’s well adjusted. He’s happy. Im happy. His father and I are happy together. We are a genuinely happy family!
OCD affects me daily. I however have made it my responsibility to never ever let that effect my son negatively. And I never will.
He just turned 4 this month…and he’s my life!
So, yes, you can be a great parent! You really can!",OCD

Hello
To have children or not is your personal choice, in it you having OCD should not be a factor.
Illness is part and parcel of mankind from time immortal. Even in this modern age people having physical illnesses like Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Heart Desease, etc, do not give it any consideration while marrying and then having children.. And when I say that both the husband and wife do not consider many physical illnesses that are genetic in nature that can be passed on to their children, as a deciding factor for having children.
OCD or Obscessive Compulsive Disorder being a mental health disorder and of the anxiety disorder family, is genetic in nature, but there is now I understand good medical treatments available for its management and to overcome it in terms of medicines and therapy. Further my father suffered from Diabites, but me and my sister don't have it. I suffer from Bipolar Disorder from age 20, but my 36 years old son does not have it.
So the decision should be entirely yours, as you and your wife are responsible for the well-being of your children.
All the best.",OCD
1075,"I think it’s a mistake to make emotional decisions based on your current set of values. When you fall in love, or realize a desire for family, your current values will change. That’s part of being a human being. If you try to take all the desire out of the equation, your answer will be wrong.",OCD
1076,"Yes, the symptoms do suggest OCD. I'm not a doctor either but my wife suffers from OCD. There are a couple of things you can do.

1. Buy a copy of Brain Lock by Dr Jeffrey Schwarz. His book tells you how you can rewire your brain and deal with OCD yourself.

2. If you are in Bangalore, go to NIMHANS. NIMHANS has one of the world's best OCD treatment centres in the world and the treatment (apart from a small registration fee), is free of cost. So your concern about it being expensive is taken care of.

3. Do some self-therapy at home, if you can. There's a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention. Briefly, list down all your fears and obsessions. Once you have done that, grade them as per severity. Start with the lowest anxiety-inducing stimuli first. And expose yourself to them. After you have done that, try and resist the compulsive behaviour that you are tempted to perform.

For example, if you are in a bus or train, rest your head against the wall and then when you get home, try to resist the urge to wash your hair. It is difficult and you may not be 100% successful at the first go itself. Do not worry. But do not give up. If you persist, you will realise soon that you are able to tolerate some of the impulses without having to act upon the compulsions.

Slowly, keep progressing to more and more difficult impulses.

The treatment requires professional help but if you are averse to seeking help, this will at least help you to control the smaller issues.

4. Do not ignore it. I repeat. Do not ignore it. OCD is progressive and it will just get worse if you do not deal with it at the right time and properly.

5. I am in Mumbai and I suspect you are too. If you want to reach out to me for guidance (from a layman who has seen his wife go through it), do write to me on snpunjabi at gmail dot com. I can put you on to people who can professionally help.

All the best.",OCD
1077,"Of course.
My father has a diagnosis of OCD and has been married for over 60 years.
He takes medication for his OCD and for GAD as well, with which he is also diagnosed. Not sure how long he has taken this medication, but for a very long time.
He has been retired a long time, but had a long and successful professional career.
After this career ended, he volunteered his professional services in the community for another 20 years or so.
Now, he just takes it easy. And deservedly so.
I think, overall, he would have been less happy unmarried than married. For one thing - married, he was blessed with me, and also my brother!
But also, my mother has always given him the structure he needs to operate day-to-day.",OCD
1078,"There is no easy answer to this.
I’d like to be optimistic, suggest that your love for her will overcome any obstacle.
I’d like to say that you’ve taken a vow, and now you should love her no matter what.
But I now know it’s not that simple.
As a person who has also been surprised by a partner’s OCD once we moved in together, I can understand the concern. In my case, it was debilitating to the point that it ruined the relationship, as he would not admit he had a problem or get help.
No, he could not handle stress. He was completely unable to handle any situation with even the smallest trace of stress, to the point of meltdowns and nasty, lingering fights. Completely unprepared, I had no idea how to deal with the ugliness of it. Even a thing like hanging new frames on the wall would trigger him. Names were called, insults hurled, doors broken in behind me when I tried to remove myself.
His control issues spanned the depth and breadth of any conceivable thing to do with the house in which we lived. The caretaking of it, the cleaning, the placement of objects inside it, the yardwork, even the animals we had.
It was as if his living area was an extension of himself, of which he could tolerate no touch, no adjustment, no intrusion.
I was forbidden from loading the dishwasher, relegated to using certain pans when I cooked, and unable to decorate for holidays - as he would stay up all night afterward, exhaustively arranging and rearranging the decorations I set out. Even the lighting was an issue. One of our biggest arguments concerned the light over the kitchen sink. He forbade me to leave it on, even though it rendered the kitchen unnavigable at night, and our bathroom was on the other side. It became an obsession for him, and he trolled the house at night, policing this light.
Oddly, that was the hill I chose to die on. It was that small light that finally broke my resolve, ending our relationship for good. I moved out shortly afterwards.
There was simply no way he could have handled children, or a health issue, or financial stress.
Thankfully, we weren’t married, so I left before it affected my own mental health any further, after nearly two years together. But even that short time left me with lingering feelings of (undiagnosed) PTSD and a stint in therapy.
I’m now wary of new partners, hyper-sensitive to any form of OCD-like behavior or control issues that might surface. I could never, ever revisit that scenario, or anything remotely similar again. It nearly broke my spirit.
Love is not always enough. It really depends on the severity of the OCD and extent to which your wife is willing to get help.
My sympathies are with you. OCD does not render a person unlovable, but it can be challenging on levels that you can’t expect or foresee until you live together.",OCD
1079,"There are alot of women out there who don't necessarily agree with having kids. I don't believe that reproducing is a good idea because of the horrific effects we've had on the planet in just the last 100 years. So I've intentionally found a partner who has no interest in reproducing. That works well and I've seen it work well for others.
Yes it's rational, yes it's worth following through with but don't deny yourself the beauty of a relationship based purely on a potentially hereditary condition.",OCD

1081,"There are more than two types of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Hoarding is usually a symptom of “Doubt & Harm"" and/or “Unacceptable & Taboo Thoughts"", while excessive cleaning is usually a symptom of “Contamination Symptoms”, and excessive neatness is a symptom of “Symmetry & Arranging”, “Doubt & Harm"", and/or “Unacceptable & Taboo Thoughts"".

1083,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1086,The current DSM lists a disorder called Hoarding disorder it is a separate disorder from OCD and a person may have one and not the other or may have both.,OCD
1087,"Yes. A wise person once told me that we all have a little bit of every mental disorder.
I also learned something specific going through the worst of it: a lot of times, the obsession is something that “normal"" people also worry about. The difference is that the volume for them is around a 2, while for a person with OCD, it's at 11.
Add to that the fact that the fear is on loop in your head, and nothing will stop it outside of performing a compulsive ritual.
One of the first symptoms I noticed was losing faith in my ability to know something for certain. I started asking for others to affirm what I thought I knew. This was especially true of the fear of contaminated food items.
In general, they say that OCD behaviors do not require professional help unless the compulsions and rituals take up more than an hour of each day.",OCD
1088,"Yes you can have OCD and be messy. OCD is characterised by obsessive thoughts, that a person cannot control. Then there’s C compulsions, a act someone will do to try to calm the obsessive thought. They are extremely distressing to the individual, there’s a lot off different types off OCD. So no you don’t have to be neat tidy or clean to have OCD.
There’s religious OCD. That means you’re OCD is about religion, then harm OCD. Where you fear you may harm someone, so you may avoid sharp objects such as knifes. It’s important not to give into the thoughts, just remember you are in control. You’re mind lies to you and it is a mental illness.
OCD is a vicious cycle. It go’s obsession compulsion then temporally relive, you need to stop this cycle. It is in no way shape or form easy, but adversely it takes six to twelve months to recover. It’s a really disabling mental disorder, there’s so much stigma around it. It’s honestly a nightmare it’s awful.
There’s lots off different compulsions. Such as adviodence , as I explained. Then there’s neat OCD there’s lots off compulsions, that an individual can’t help. It’s important to remember, that you’re struggles are valid. No one and I mean no one has the right to tell you otherwise if they do that’s a them problem.",OCD
1089,"Yes, my friend has obsessive thoughts and, interestingly, hasn’t been diagnosed with anxiety or OCD.
It’s been a bit of a journey for him. He's gone to doctors and psychiatrists, expecting to hear something definitive, but after several evaluations, none of the professionals have pointed to a specific disorder. That was confusing at first—because he or even us for that matter, assume obsessive thoughts always mean something like OCD—but it turns out, that’s not always the case.
Despite not having a formal diagnosis, the thoughts were still there and could get overwhelming at times.
So, he decided to see a therapist at ‘MantraCare’ to work through managing them. Therapy helped him find healthier ways to respond to those thoughts and ease some of the distress that came with them. He’s found that the consistent support and coping strategies he’s learning have made a big difference in his daily life.
If you're in a similar situation or just need someone to talk to, I’d really recommend reaching out to a therapist at ‘MantraCare’.
Whether you’ve been diagnosed with something or not, therapy can be great for understanding and managing your mental health. My friend speaks very highly of their experience and suggests MantraCare to anyone. You can even book a trial therapy session with them—it’s affordable and effective, and it might be the support you're looking for!",OCD
1090,"Narcy can, and most often will, present with what outwardly appears as OCD. But, what it is in reality are signs and symptoms of his narcissism.
It's his need to control his environment. His need for power. His unrealistic idea of perfectionism.
For example, good ol Narcy and I both share the same profession where routine stops for coffee occur frequently every day. Now Narcy has to line up the lid on his coffee in a very precise way…so that the seam of the cup is lined up perfectly opposite of the lid opening.
One day when Narcy was riding on my very last nerve…I simply twisted the lid on his coffee cup. He almost put us, truck, loaded trailer and all into a ditch swerving all over the roadway because he HAD to fix the lid. He couldn't even look at it without practicality twitching. (We used to be a team)
Pull one string on his shoelace. He will literally have untie the whole thing and have to re-tie it all over. Right then and there.
There were times when he'd act up and I'd just look at him and say “knock it off or I'll twist that coffee lid good Mr”…and the look of sheer terror like “you wouldn't dare” followed by the instant memory and realization of “omg, you would” was a priceless little gem that never got old. Lol
Remember that Narcy’s narcissism controls him. Not the other way around. He's obscessive and compulsive at all times. Its part of his narcissism. Whatever triggers his narcissism is like an itch he must immediately scratch no matter what, at any cost. He honestly cannot control this.
But, to the casual onlooker, it's easily confused for OCD. And it's not uncommon for Narcy to explain it away as such either.",OCD
1091,"Yes they are. They are very obsessive. They think they own you. And there’s nothing you can do to change that in their mind cause once you have dealt with a narcissist they will always and I mean always come back for some reason and the reasons is not that they love or miss you it’s because in their mind you are their possession and they own you. This is what makes them obsessed with you. And if you have any ties to them like kids with them your life would be a living hell cause they will use them kids to abuse and manipulate you. So with that being said like they always say if you can go no contact then do it and don’t give in cause once you do it’s the same bs all over again but worse. I know from experience and it’s the worse life I have every lived cause the more I try the harder it gets...

1092,"Yes, I’m an NPD and my OCD manifests itself in two ways:
1) I have peculiar behavior sometimes where I do repeated baseless actions, like getting out of my car and then getting back in by taking both feet off the ground at the same time, or closing the door twice. Or setting an object down with one hand and then touching it with equal pressure with both hands before I walk away from it.
2) I’m a clean freak. Not a germophobe mind you, but I hate clutter in the house. I’ll even do things like pick up a pencil at the bottom of a stairwell in someone else’s house, and put it on a desk where it belongs.
The OCD in my case isn’t damaging to myself or others, and in fact I make a conscious effort not to do it in front of others… though sometimes it slips. It’s probably some part of my sub-concious mind reinforcing perfectionist ideals, or trying to repair or compensate for my NPD.",OCD
1093,"It's not uncommon to be diagnosed with both narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). NPD and OCD have similar symptoms and risk factors, including high levels of perfectionism, a need for control, and rigid thought and behavior patterns. Having both conditions often leads to severe symptoms that require more intensive treatments, such as group or individual therapy and psychiatric medication.
1. Higher Likelihood for NPD
Researchers have found that people with OCD are much more likely to develop a personality disorder than those with other mental illnesses. For example, one study found that 74% of participants with OCD had a co-occurring personality disorder, compared to only 55% of those with a different diagnosis.3 This research suggests that OCD frequently co-occurs with personality disorders, and may even be a risk factor for developing a personality disorder later in life.
2. Common Risk Factors
OCD and NPD share some of the same risk factors, including biological, social, and environmental factors. All of these elements may work to increase someone’s likelihood of developing a certain disorder.
Shared risk factors for NPD and OCD include:2, 5, 6, 7, 8
Experiencing childhood trauma
Ineffective parenting styles
Being highly sensitive or reactive as a child
Perfectionism and neuroticism
High levels of impulsivity
3. NPD & Coping With OCD Symptoms
OCD is a highly debilitating mental illness that makes it very difficult to function in daily life.8 Some researchers believe that narcissistic traits and tendencies could be a coping strategy or defense mechanism that makes it easier to cope with symptoms of OCD.
Some examples of coping with OCD through narcissism include:9
Superiority or arrogance might allow people with OCD to believe their way of doing things is the ‘right’ or ‘better’ way
Self-centeredness may allow someone with OCD to focus solely on their wants, needs, and preferences
Lower levels of empathy can reduce concerns about how a person’s OCD tendencies are affecting or impacting others
Projecting blame outward can help people with OCD maintain the illusion that they’re fully in control of their lives and circumstances
4. High-Maintenance Disorders
Another link between the symptoms of OCD and NPD is that people with these conditions often demand special treatment and accommodations from others. Those with NPD usually feel like they’re entitled to certain privileges that aren’t offered to others. Likewise, a person with OCD is similarly high-maintenance and demanding, and often expects others to be willing to accommodate their rigid schedules, routines, and specific preferences.9
Some examples of high-maintenance behaviors and demands in OCD and NPD include:
Demanding an upgraded room at a hotel
Ordering special items not on the menu at a restaurant
Excessive requests made of an assistant at work
Becoming outraged when something is not done ‘just right’
Becoming fixated and angry when they feel slighted by someone
5. Desire for Control
Both OCD and NPD usually involve a strong desire to be in a position of authority, control, or power, but for slightly different reasons. For people with OCD, the need for complete control over their lives, circumstances, and environment is driven by high levels of anxiety and neuroticism. Conversely, those with NPD may be driven by a want for power, authority, or status.
6. Perfectionism
Perfectionism is common in people diagnosed with both conditions. A person with co-occurring NPD and OCD often displays rigid and perfectionistic tendencies in one or more areas of their lives. Often, perfectionistic tendencies are driven by a desire for success and a laser-like focus on achieving specific goals in life.2
7. External Conditions for Internal Stability
In both OCD and NPD, it’s common for a person to have certain external ‘conditions’ that need to be met in order to feel emotionally stable. For example, someone with OCD may feel anxious or upset if another person puts something in the wrong place. This same behavior might cause a narcissist to feel disrespected or even outraged. In both disorders, there is an emotional reliance on external circumstances that one relies on to feel calm or stable.
8. Obsessive Thoughts
It can be argued that both OCD and NPD can cause obsessions and compulsions. In OCD, obsessions are often focused on upsetting or scary thoughts, such as making a mistake or getting sick. Narcissistic obsessions may center around power, success, envy, or revenge that the narcissist fantasizes, rehearses, or ruminates on.
9. Compulsive Behaviors
Compulsions are often an attempt to feel more secure or in control. Compulsive behaviors are are driven by strong impulses and urges, which are features of both obsessive-compulsive disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. In both conditions, people are often driven by these strong urges and impulses, which can become destructive and problematic for them.
Some examples of compulsive behaviors in NPD and OCD include:
A need for praise and validation
A need to get reassurance from others
A need to compete with people or one-up them
A need to find answers, research things, or be right
A need to feel in control of a situation
10. Complicated Treatment
It’s not uncommon to be diagnosed with both OCD and NPD. In fact, one study found that among people with OCD, about 4.5% also had an NPD diagnosis, compared to just .9% of those with other kinds of mental illness.Having both NPD and OCD has been linked to exacerbated symptoms and impairment, thus complicating the treatment process. For instance, research shows that those with OCD and a co-occurring personality disorder require more intensive treatment than others with just OCD",OCD
1094,"O-H Y-E-S!!!!!!!!!!!!.. Its obsession like you've never encountered before in your life!.. especially when your dealing with a malignant narc. I truly believe the depths of how obsessive they become is from demonic possession. I've seen non narcs obsessed, but when you encounter a narc, let alone a malignant it takes obsession to brand new levels and new heights. They're truly sick , twisted, and depraved individuals
I know this sounds crazy, but I honestly believe they're worst than psychopaths. Mainly because A psychopath basically has little to none feelings except for occasions when they feel that you're in the way of them getting something they want… BUT when it comes to narcs they don't even have to know you or may have little to none contact with them in order for them to become obsessed with you. A narcissists obsession also has a possessiveness to it like if you're property, which makes the obsessiveness much worse. Stay away from these miserable demonic toddlers, because not only do they not mean anyone else any good, but they don’t mean themselves any good neither. They're truly sick and need to be avoided at all costs!",OCD
1095,"My ex-narcissist had a very limited range of interests—music and politics—Musicians just want to play music, that’s a given, but they’re normal people too and do have outside interests and an interest in life itself—but my nex wouldn’t notice a sunset if it landed in his lap!
I found the narrowness of his interests to be pathological in the extreme albeit at times amusing while pathetic and bewildering. He certainly had obsessions and compulsions. He was obsessed with what he *didn’t* like!
He appeared to have almost no interest in food! It made me want to take care of this poor lost thing! He doesn’t know what food is! I will cook for him and show him food! Good food!
What interest in food he had was narrow and quirky—he wouldn’t eat anything squishy or “mixed”—that left apples. They aren’t squishy or ‘mixed’ — I will bake him an apple pie and he will find he likes it! And he’ll smile! :-)
When we met he had no furniture in his living-room although he had lived there ~20 years and could well afford it. Clearly entertaining wasn’t his thing! There was no art on his walls. Art wasn’t his thing, that’s for sure. He said the people in his office thought he was weird because he had no photos in his cubicle. He carried no photos as well. People aren’t his thing?
He wore ill-fitting baggy jeans and navy blue shirts all the time and said “clothes don’t matter.” He had no spiritual beliefs and told me angels can’t fly to earth because they’ll disintegrate in the atmosphere. I told him, “Angels can’t disintegrate because they’re spirits and spirits can’t disintegrate.” I believe that was the only thing I ever said he couldn’t argue with, despite his PhD in quantum physics.
He promulgated untenable beliefs beyond the pale of reality. He told me Jesus never existed and I said, “no credible historian has ever argued that Jesus didn’t exist, look him up on Wikipedia. If he never existed why does he have a wiki page?”
That reminds me of the time a stranger ran up to me when I was waking alone and screamed, “Nobody can tell him anything!” then ran away … I do believe that’s the hallmark of a narcissist—no one can tell them anything!
My nex denied reality, and specifically my reality. He tried to convince me I was nuts! I wish I had heeded that stranger’s warning, but I just didn’t get it at the time.
He was obsessive in what he ruled out of his life, which was nearly everything! He had no interest in travel, animals, pets, plants, children, having a family, getting married, foreign countries, on and on. . He only had two settings: music and politics.
He obsessively and compulsively collected ‘tunes’ — music was it and that was that except for constant sorties into political harangues! When it came to music he was an idiot-savant who can play everything and anything by heart and not miss a note! Imagine those people who memorize the phone book and you’ll get it! It was mind-boggling. He was a walking encyclopedia of world music. No one ever had to look anything up. Just ask him!
I might add that his music was wonderful but his political views were horrific, cultish and downright dangerous. He held these extremist views because his interest in life itself was so narrow he couldn’t see the forest for the trees and would believe anyone who said anything no matter how outrageous as long as they’d lower his taxes. He was politically apolitical in a way. Just lower my taxes. I don’t care who dies, his stance implied! (A true narcissist doesn’t care who dies!)
I believe his two obsessions were a mask and a shield to lock the world out and lock himself in and keep people from viewing him at close range lest they discover his true nature and not like him. He told me at the onset, “Women don’t like me, I’m weird. I upset them.”
When someone tells you who they are, believe them! But I took that as a plea for attention, a lament that he’d met a lot of bad women who made him feel sad ’cause he’s geeky. But I didn’t mind. I like geeky guys. I wanted to get to know him. I’ll be the good woman who saved him from all those bad ones!
But it’s hard to get to know someone when they have a musical instrument in their mouth most of the time and blast talk radio politics in their car. He didn’t want to get to know me, he wanted to take me over. It wasn’t a pushover—it was a takeover! He wanted to take me over and make me over spiritually, politically and in every way possible. He didn’t want me, he wanted my soul.
Narcissists make you an extension of themselves and if you bulk they abuse you until you step in line and toe it! The only escape is to run! People with narcissistic personality disorder rarely change! They simply don’t want to.
Why should they? They’re getting everything they want just the way they are. Run away, just run! Don’t try to fix them—you can’t! Running is your only escape! Go no contact and don’t look back!",OCD
1096,"Short answer is yes. Ocd can. Go hand in hand with many other mental conditions such as asd, bpd, psychopathy, aspd and indeed narcissist. I fall under three of these and am not qualified to speak on behalf of any narcissists but ocd definitely overlaps with other conditions and worsens it. I would argue that a narcissist with ocd is one of the most dangerous people you can run in to.",OCD
1097,"Yes, narcissists tend to be highly obsessive. While they may not obsess over one single topic or individual, they often display obsessive behavior in the way they interact with people and the world around them.
Narcissists are known for their grandiosity and self-importance which often leads to a need for constant admiration from others. This creates an incessant desire for attention and validation which can lead to manipulative behavior in order to gain these needs met. As part of this need for admiration, narcissists will become intensely focused on certain topics or activities that can act as a means of validating their sense of worthiness in the eyes of other people. They also become preoccupied with controlling situations and feeling superior over other individuals through manipulation or even aggression if necessary - all while being completely unaware (or uncaring) about how their actions are impacting others around them.
This Will Make The Narcissist Obsessed With You",OCD
1098,"No, because narcissist is not a legitimate disorder— it's basically a synonym for preoccupation with self or rational self interest. All of us are that way.
However, it is possible for someone to be diagnosed with both OCD and NPD. NPD is narcissistic personality disorder that is an official diagnosis in the DSM-V.",OCD
1099,"GREAT QUESTION!
The narcissists overall personality:
Insecure: They live with a fear of people thinking they're worthless and inferior. And that's because they know that they're only putting up a front, but have zero substance to them.
Defensive: Because narcissists lie so much, they'll put up their defenses quickly, when asked a question, or being accused of something.
Depressed: There's an underlying depression that makes master of the narcissist, as soon as the narcissist is alone with their thoughts. That's the reason for them needing constant distraction and thrills.
Angry: They're angry at the world. Feeling that they’ve been dealt a bad hand in life. Failing to understand that they themselves are responsible for their living circumstances and the consequences of their own behavior.
Envious: Subsequent to them feeling that life's unfair and that they're inferior to others. They're extremely envious people. They think everyone, but them, is effortlessly making it through life. Born with a silver spoon in their mouth and whatnot. Accomplished people are a thorn in the narcissists eyes. They created their alter ego to feign succes and worth, but when confronted with actual succes it eats them alive.
Juvenile: Narcissists never emotionally developed past their childhood. Which makes their conflict resolution skills and just their general thought process very immature. When in an argument with a narcissist, they'll blurt out things like: Everyone hates you!! Or their lack of responsibility, like having unprotected sex with everyone and not caring if the bills are paid, are all manifestations of that immaturity.
So basically, a narcissists personality boils down to:
A petulant, bad kid.",OCD
1100,It originates in the brain….. just like all thinking.. Can we learn it -possibly. can we unlearn it? yes by dumping daft religious notions and studying critical thinking and logical fallacies and scepticism.,OCD
1101,"Magical thinking is a belief in one’s innate superiority. The magical thinker believes that they are above the laws of nature, that they need not study such laws and act accordingly, but merely wish something to be so, and it will happen.
It's just like how you think you can cause brain tissue in the narcissist’s right anterior insula to grow, causing him to experience empathy, simply by letting him put his ding-dong inside you.
Dream on,
Robert",OCD
1102,"I would guess that everyone is different. For myself I had rituals and weird thoughts in my early years but it gradually got worse overtime. By my mid 20s the fear and unwanted thoughts were so bad I typed a rambling letter to my doctor of all my religious obsessions and fears.
She put me on Prozac for OCD. That worked for a couple months but I had panic and more problems, then a year later I was put on Paxil. This was 1995.
SSRIs are not a magic bullet or happy pills. They take months and years to work. And the longer you have had the OCD symptoms, the longer it will take. Of course meds alone aren’t the complete answer, you need talk therapy and someone willing to listen to you. I had my mother. Big blow when she died in 2003. Since then I’ve been battling severe depression.
I hope this helps. I’m so sorry and good luck. Hugs.",OCD
1103,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1105,"Obsessive compulsive disorder is a psychological problem which is caused by the obsession of anything . The treatment of physical diseases is possible and they can be cured by medication and precautions. But it is a herculean task to cure the patient of psychological disease.
The ancient world was free from such mental disorders because the people had no inordinate ambition . Human beings are the central point on this beautiful planet . They , being earthly creatures , should be ambitious but their ambitions must have limitations. When they nurture the vaulting ambition of Shakespeare's protagonist Macbeth, they become the victim of mental disorders . In this way we are seized by the glamour of pelf and power and thus catastrophy is inevitable. It is our material thinking that proves the character of destiny. Most of the people are suffering from such anomalies. Unreasonable thinking and fears are two main symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD) . Family background, social interactions and personal thinking are some of the remarkable factors that bring obsessive compulsive disorder. A survey has concluded that only privileged people are victim of OCD. The poor are far away from such psychological disorders because they don't have inordinate ambition. Someone has rightly said: cut your cloth according to your coat.",OCD
1106,"I got possessed by some unseen supernatural powers when I was young. Hailing from a decent family, everyone including myself thought it to be a psychiatric issue and sought help from my uncle who was a neurosurgeon. Even after 6 months of meds, my condition never improved. I felt drugged all the time due to severe side effects of the psychiatric meds I had been prescribed. Belonging to a hindu family, I was taken to a saint who was a Krishnaa devotee. He treated me with holy water , asked me to chant Lord Hanuman's name (god's name) in meditation. Though it took 5-6 months , but finally I got treated.
As pointed out by the saint, the reasons for possession are->1) Not being chaste/ celibate
2) Eating meat & non-veg food, which are the foods of ghosts/ jinns/ bad spirits
3) Not meditating on God's name, which is the biggest deterrent against possession and invisible powers
[One can chant any God's name of his/her religion/faith, but should be done in meditation with eyes closed to see instant effect. The longer one does it, the more benefit one will see(min 15 minutes a day). Also strict physical celibacy is needed; else meditation on God won't show results]
The Mental disorders that I got rid of after following the above rules->
1) Heavy head
2) Sleeplessness/ severe insomnia- I could not sleep for 8-10 months in a row & no meds could make me fall asleep either
3) Vivid nightmares , which occurred every time I tried to sleep. [Bad supernatural powers cause bad dreams, like falling from cliff, you/ family members getting killed]
4) Shouting violently when asleep even for a moment
5) Throwing arms & legs in dreams
THE SUPERNATURAL POWERS MOSTLY CAUSE MENTAL DISORDERS , WHICH RESEMBLE A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. SO ITS DIFFICULT TO DETECT.
According to the saint, jinns/spirits are in the form of air in this world & are invisible to humans on an average spiritual level . (But once a person comes on a very high spiritual level through strict 'celibacy' & meditation on God over lifetime, he/she attains spiritual powers to see these evil creatures) . Also, these jinns/spirits can attack only the people at low/average spiritual level (ie, who are not chaste/ don't meditate on God's names), that means, they can attack almost everyone on earth, as most of us don't lead a spiritual life. They attach themselves to the person's nervous system as well as circulatory system. They tend to play with the two organs- brain & heart.
The reason for attachment is to get Pleasure out of your body. So, to get pleasure , these powers first enter your physical body via air & once inside the lungs, move into circulatory system and attach themselves to heart, brain, spinal cord etc. Once attached to your body, they get the pleasure that you're getting through food etc (So celibacy is a strict criteria as these creatures like sex pleasures through one's body).
Possession varies ( the % of body getting possessed), & thus can be classified into partial possession and complete possession. Partial possession if not controlled through strict celibacy & meditation will surely move to a full possession in which the possessed person will lose entire control over his body & mind.
Also possession never starts from full directly; it always progress from slight to partial to complete. However , if one reached to a complete possession state, the jinn/spirit has complete command over your body & can do/say anything through your body. In that case, the victim's claims of seeing other beings, creatures, etc. is not what the victim sees, but what actually the spirit sees
After going through the possession, I now believe in both science and spirituality. It has made me much stronger. I also cracked CAT in my first attempt & converted 3 of the IIMs (prestigious MBA college in India).
Also , I've extensively written this article so that anyone who faces any such issue , easily identifies the same & applies the above remedies to his/her benefit. :) :)",OCD
1107,"Yes, when you are trying to direct your life from fear, you become compulsive, etc. It is acting out from the lack of accepting “ Thy Will Be Done.” I can not play God, or protect me, I have to surrender to the love of the universe for my needs to be met and I can rest in the presence of love. give up your fears, resentments, and anger to allow your heart to open and fill you with love and direct your way.
In the last few days, I found out more about my OCD which caused me a big concern. I found it comes from me from trying to be perfect as I always felt I was less then others. If I am perfect maybe I would be loved and liked.
This is also called pride or wearing a mask to look good to others when inside I am totally distraught trying to be part of life. I had to get honest with myself and release the pride which is a false cover and drop the mask to look good and feel that I am good enough to others. My actions did not support the real me that always has been good enough in God’s eyes and love me with all my short comings.",OCD
1108,"It's them assuming you know something just because they do, treating you as an extension of themselves. If they know it, you must know it. It's another symptom of their self-absorbtion a failure to recognise boundaries or individuals as separate entities. As far as they are concerned there is only ONE mind here, ONE personality. Theirs.
An extreme example is a stalker (who are often NPD) This person has decided you are a couple that you adore him, you are engaged to be married. He/she follows you everywhere, sends you flowers, watches you. As far as he is concerned you reciprocate. He has imposed/projected his mindset, his needs, his wants on you not even 'seeing' you as a real separate individual. That is magical thinking.",OCD
1109,"Its quite vicious to treat in a single dimensional repair. Too convoluted to achieve with simple anti-thought.
I would recommend firstly normalize all hormones and vital parameters like Na and Mg levels, B12 D3 levels. Fibre levels. Avoid pesticides, avoid preservatives. Meditate and light exercises. Avoid alcohol, caffeine.
Restore Serotonin and Dopamine levels. Avoid excessive sugar intake.
Talk to wise people to avoid convoluted thinking.
Take help from medication to normalize your physical body and then finally make that brave attempt to fight it. Else its too debilitating and overwhelming to fight.
Fight with all the ammunition else it can come back stronger and trap you more seriously each time.
I hope that helps!",OCD
1110,"If they are doing from their will and enjoying it, not a problem. But if their brain forces them to do it and they know it's wrong, then they have OCD and should go to a doctor.",OCD
1111,"Oh!
There is a difference between habit and ritualization of a habit. If a person still counts steps or avoids walking on pavement lines in emergency/ crisis/or in a hurry and if he does go back to count steps or get to the start to walk again avoiding lines then it could be OCD.
Merely having habit of walking in a particular way or counting and making designs using your fingers on your palm is not OCD...!",OCD
1112,"I count in my head all the time. I also put my fingers together and count by two's, up and down.
If it interferes with your life, it's time to get help. Chances are, you are doing other repetitive things in your life that you don't realize.
For instance, I was given a test (decades ago), where they doctor would ask me, ""Do you ....."" (I think I got in the 90's out of 100). What I found interesting, though, was some of the questions I would answer, 'Doesn't everyone?' and we would give me this sad little sneer meaning, ""Nope, just you.""
If you can have fun with it, not all OCD needs to be treated. When it causes a problem, it's good to be checked. It's an anxiety-based disorder, but the anxiety level would depend on several factors that a professional would monitor.",OCD
1113,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD

1115,"I’ve had diagnosed OCD since age 8. I never think of them as rituals. “Compulsions” is a phrase nearer the mark, but I would actually say that I experience them as gaps in short-term memory.
Let me explain.
One of my issues is handwashing. I worry that my hands are not clean enough, free of germs or chemicals, to cook or to handle a baby. I wash them. Then as I turn away from the sink, I stop because I can’t remember if I actually washed them, or just intended to.
Have you ever meant to take a pill or something and can’t remember if you actually did it or just meant to? Similarly, the lack of memory of handwashing vexes me to the point I feel like I have to wash them again just to be sure. I wash them again. Then I turn to whatever it was I was planning to cook. Did I wash my hands?
Half of the problem comes from going on autopilot while I’m handwashing, I think. I don’t think about what I’m doing, so I’ve got no memory of it. I try to combat this with scented soaps so that I can sniff-test my skin. But what if the scent is lingering from earlier? What if I’ve touched something since?
I touch the countertop and can’t remember if I sanitized it recently. What if an egg had touched it? What if raw meat has touched it? What about dirt or chemicals from produce? What about snail-borne brain-eating amoebas? I’d better sanitize it again to make sure. The wet dish cloth bothers me. What else has it touched? Better wash my hands.
This is how my day goes. My hands are rough and red. In the winter they swell, crack and throb. It gets worse when I feel stressed or out of control.
I have other manifestations, but handwashing is the bad one. I don’t necessarily feel like I have to perform a handwashing ritual to stave off disaster, but that I try to remember having completed a healthy, one-time wash and can’t, so I have to do it again and again.",OCD
1116,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
1117,"Absolutely, cleanliness and symmetry (which I call a specific type of obsession that falls under the category of keeping things a specific way) are just two of the many obsessions a person with OCD may have. Other obsessions can be always wearing a certain style of clothes or even the same outfit everyday, doing something a specific number of times or performing them until one reaches a certain number of numeric or alphabetical counts, constantly checking to see if doors or windows are locked or appliances are turned off, driving the exact same way to a place, doing things always at the same time everyday, reciting a specific verse while performing a task. I’m sure there are many others. But these are ones I can think of atm. From my experience, and also according to therapists, OCD gives a person a sense of control over things that otherwise feel a lack of.
My most problematic obsession involves cutting up my food a very exact way and arranging it on my bowl or plate a certain way. It can take me up to 5 hours to prepare a meal in order to get it right. I guess this would fall under the category you call symmetry. My OCD can make it very difficult to complete all or even most of my daily tasks.",OCD
1118,"While I acknowledge OCD can be dark. I see my OCD as another side of me, that I make work for me. I have a balance to bring out the benefit such as my scrupulous attention to detail. I love that edge it gives me. What some people consider good enough. I want more and while it can extremely fucking annoying it makes things perfect and good enough for me. I like the burst of creativity my OCD gives me it keeps my thinking inside, outside and back to front of the box. The mind is powerful and I make my OCD a unique asset of mine. So for me personally, I couldn't say it's necessary but to each their own.",OCD
1119,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD
1120,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder has multiple components:
Obsessions are recurrent thoughts, beliefs or ideas that permeate an individual's thinking. Many times these obsessions are fear-based.
Compulsions are repetitive behaviors that occur as a result of these obsessions. These behaviors can start as a way to appease the obsessive thoughts, and over time can become ritual-like and take huge amounts of time that control a person's life.
Impairment and/or anxiety results from having both obsessions and compulsions within one's daily life.
One of the most common traits is fear of contamination. This can be a good thing, as it keeps hygiene levels high and limits the spread of disease.
Impairment can be considered when it disrupts one's ability to function interpersonally or in other aspects of life. Ex: Someone cleans or organizes so much they stop going out to see friends, or can't leave the house without ritually cleaning or organizing for several hours. If they do not clean, there is a large amount of stress/anxiety created and the person has no other way to relieve the stress but to clean. It's a cycle.
Eustress (good stress) can help people become successful. It depends on each person's thresholds for stress and time management skills, too. There is a positive correlation of OCD with high intellect and income.
Mild OCD is manageable and does not have to be considered an impairment. The problem with these labels is they can be taken negatively, where at times it's the easiest way to describe what's going on to someone else so they have a picture of what someone is experiencing. These labels have a history of being stigmatized and heavily negative.
Mild OCD can simply be needing to do some ritual every day. It is more common than people think, and is not necessarily a bad thing. OCD is not the same as OCPD (Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder), which is a personality disorder that is associated with rigid perfectionism, inflexible, and an inability to make life decisions because of this need for perfection. It can be very debilitating having either, but symptoms run along a spectrum.
Having mild (insert mental condition) depends on a person's ability to function daily. If it is considered mild, then most of the time the person is able to do well in areas of life: socially, personally, professionally, etc. These labels are here to identify a spectrum of symptoms, and under that it also depends on how well a person can live a meaningful life with these symptoms, because everyone has something. Some of us are more resilient than others and would not consider having OCD an impairment. It depends on tools, and the ability to use these tools well.",OCD
1121,"While, I have never been officially been diagnosed, I suspect that I'm a little OCD. But my OCD is different, and functions in the mind, showing little outward manifestation. I may have a more severe form of OCD, I just haven't heard of anyone having my symptoms.
For instance, while I may not wash my hands multiple times in a row, I will pace for a while having an imaginary 5-minute conversation I had earlier, or one I wished I had (yes, it is weird). That or a girl, which is sad because it's stopped me from being in any major relationships, because I eventually become obsessed with a girl. Anyways, This 5-minute conversation could be played on a little mental loop for an hour easily. Normally I will pace in a loop around my dining room and living roomtable a couple hundred times a day.
Not only that, this OCD can ""strike"" at bad times, like in the middle of a real-life conversation with a girl that likes you.
Girl: So you have a gf?
Sean: No
Girl: Well I think I might really like someone, but I'm not sure if he likes me back. But it doesn't matter, I don't think it will work.
Sean: Oh, ok. Well, that's a shame.
Girl: You want to know who I like?
Sean: Sure.
Girl: I like you.
Sean: .....I like me too.
One of the more humorous moments of my life, it taught me to never zone out of a conversation, no matter what. This has bern difficult, but I have learned what goes on in front of me is very critical.",OCD
1122,"Is having to organize everything in an orderly fashion considered OCD? I also have to have routines every day to feel at a comfort level. Organization, rules, guidelines, steps, all come first and if one is out of place I go cookoo bananas. I am extremely friendly but further thinking about it, it is to keep things under control. I am a teacher and I like to lead, control everything. It makes me an amazing mother to my four-year-old since children love order as well (even though they will never say it). If a new job doesn’t explain how to do something well to me, I cannot function past the step I was stuck in. I have to fix it. Can someone help me to understand if I have mild ocd? I can function in dirty places but feel extremely uncomfortable and an urge to clean it up. I didn’t used to be this way but as time goes on I have become extremely organized. My plants have to face a certain way, my things have to go back into their assigned cabinet, my floors have to be swept and mopped every day, I cannot feel anything under my feet when I’m walking bare foot. I also have to vacuum every day and in the cracks of the sofa. My pillows all have to go back in their original spot, one pillow cannot go on the opposite side. It just does not work this way! My son has a toy closet organized by category, and he knows where his trains go back into. Train tracks in their box, trains in their box, action figures and cars in their box, puzzles in their box, books on the bookshelf, organized by size. :( The more I put this into writing the more I realize I have a level of OCD. Someone help!",OCD
1123,"I have social anxiety and depression and now I have been noticing that I might have some form of OCD (not severe but mild).
I am generally very anxious person and except social situations, there are many more things that trigger my anxiety. I am also a huge perfectionist which frustrates me as everything needs to be perfect and because of that I might seem controlling especially when other people do stuff and I am involved in it. However I can’t say anything because I don’t wanna be rude so I tend to stay out of it and that only leaves me being harsh on myself.
anyway…
The following are things that I noticed I am doing that might be related to OCD:
whoever comes to my house needs to take their shoes off otherwise I won’t be able to stop thinking about it… if there is a situation they walk in in their shoes that is all I can think about. (Sometimes I feel bad for asking them to take them off because when I go to their house I cannot take off mine)
referring to the above, when I go to someone’s house and they all walk inside in their shoes it triggers me. To me that doesn’t make any sense. If there is a moment I need to take my shoes off and I see the floor is not clean later on I only think about my feet stepping on that floor (it’s obsessing..I can’t even tell that person about it because I might seem crazy) I tend to avoid going to my friend’s houses or having sleepovers because of that but luckily most of the time they all keep their shoes on so I can too!! Which kinda makes me feel bad since they need to take off theirs in my house… however if I am 100% sure that everything is clean and it is safe for me to take my shoes off without obsessing about it later, I will do it.
open drawers or cabinets give me Anxiety and make me obsess about it until they are closed
before I go to eat and I am in my bedroom I will wash my hands before I go down and if I do anything before I sit at a table (set up plates etc) I will go and wash my hands again although I never touch my food with my hands (I hate that) and they probably aren’t dirty. I need to wash them otherwise I cannot eat in peace. In general, I wash my hands A LOT, this is just an example.
I tend to organise and align stuff
i check if a glass is clean before I drink from it (especially if I am not at home) and if I eat somewhere else I am always paranoid I am gonna find a hair or something in my food… which has happened. unfortunately.
I can’t sit on a bed that isn’t made or a sofa that has a cover and it’s all messy. It bothers me a lot.
no matter how my house is clean (my mum being a cleaner and something I am too) I can only be barefoot in my room. usually I wear slippers around the house.
I like pets (I don’t have any) but I can’t stand dog/cat hair on my clothes when I go to someone’s house. It gives me huge anxiety. if I come home my clothes being full of it, I instantly take them off and go straight into the shower. (funny thing when I was younger I used to love cats and my grandma had one and it lived outside and I had no problem taking it in my hands hugging it…) Again if I know it is safe and that person is very clean (which I am embarrassed to admit as I don’t want to judge anyone) I know that the pets are gonna be clean so I don’t have a problem.
I am not diagnosed with OCD but I do suspect that I have some kind of form but not to the point I can’t function properly. But I can definitely say that some things that haven’t been there before and I had no problems with have now become a problem…
These are just some of the major issues I could remember that really have an impact on me as I constantly find myself in these situations. It’s really hard as I am embarrassed to admit (and I fear criticism and being judged) how I feel in those situations and that I can’t stop thinking about stuff that are probably ridiculous to other people while they make me extremely Anxious to the point I become obsessed.",OCD
1124,"When u have an OCD...the surrounding people suffer a lot.
#my husband gets irritated when I tell him to put his shoes in shoe rack according to color.(black then brown then beige then blue)
#my mom cringes when I re-arrange her closet(same colored clothes together)
#my sister almost hit me when I arranged her books according to size.
#my best friend says am rudest person ever...all because of my OCD
Though I consider it mild OCD but yes!! I m surely suffering from it.",OCD
1125,"OCD is a condition whereby one does not know the difference between logic and unusual drives and if they do they still follow the latter.
They follow the latter because it has far more power than behaving logically. It is always negative, rarely positive.
It threatens you with bad stuff if you do not abide by it. Do this or . . !!!!!
It is a cruel way of our subconscious minds turning against us in the same way as our bodies do with inflammation leading to worsening consequences.
In a mild form, as with everything there is a spectrum (differing degrees) you might not be aware of it until someone points it out and if does not effect your life in a negative way then there is no harm.
Mild OCD is often seen as superstition and a lot of us have these thoughts. Many celebrities/ sports people/ musicians etc go through these behaviours before performing and ironically is not seen as OCD.",OCD
1126,"OCD is never really “mild”. If it is truly OCD, then it will disrupt life in a major way!",OCD
1127,"I have a little bit of OCD.
My deals with being clean.
My body is very clean, I don't know how many times that I wash my hands.
My apartment is real clean, I never let My apartment get dirty.
My pantry and closets are neatly in order, I know where everything is.
The food cans in my pantry are stack nice with labels sticking out.I
I like the number 3, so I do everything in 3s.",OCD

1130,"Not all of them have concern for the germs already on their body, usually it's the germs outside their body that cause the main problem, like a empty container, dirty sink, or not washed clothes, to state a few.
If an individual with OCD had a contamination related problem, likely the phobia will differ.
Not every germ disrupts them. But ones they are aware of and are visible would be there main attention.
If an individual possibly found out about this information, likely it would go this way:
They begin acting out rituals to lessen the uneasy thoughts, or premonitory urges, but they know it will be difficult to constantly do, so instead, they formulate a rule, the rule will be if they manage to instead touch their skin ten times they will then have to wash their hands.
Sometimes, they will rearrange their rule, stretching it out to something they can't obtain quickly: If I touch my forearm forty times I will then have to wash my hands.
This concludes in them preventing themselves from washing their hands every single time, but it also results to them obtaining to the the rule for a lengthy duration of time.",OCD
1131,"Not all pathogens are equally pathogenic. Paul Ewald demonstrated that rapid passes of a fluid-borne pathogen from one animal to another promoted the evolution of a more virulent strain that would more rapidly and destructively exploit host resources. Eating yogurt is not the same as licking a toilet seat.
Or, as one friend put it ""It's okay to be sticky if it's your sticky.""",OCD
1132,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1133,haha most germaphobes have a sort of fail-safe function that operates like a shield when overwhelmed with stimuli. And it is eminently less threatening to know we re all in the same boat,OCD
1134,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
1135,"Living with OCD is really really hard!
Its all a mind game, in your mind, there are some associations. Some intrusive thoughts,images or urges that causes extreme anxiety are followed by some actions (compulsions) which may or may not be directly related to that obsessive thoughts,images and urges but you perform such compulsions in order to reduce the anxiety.
Now your mind is trained…when ever you think of dirt, anxiety exacerbates, you wash your hands to reduce anxiety…and this cycle goes on and on!
So even a slightest thought of dirt or germs may lead u to perform this ritual.
Now, what you should to is to play with your mind, TRICK it the way it TRICKS YOU….
How?
Through rubber band method.
Wear a rubber band on your wrist,not very tight so that it does not mess up with your blood circulation. Now when ever you have an intrusive thought,image or idea, say to yourself ""Hello again, you silly little critical thought! How are you today?""just snap the rubber band… so that it will divert your attention from the thoughts to the pain this snapping cause. If you alone, you should say it loud. Then imagine that thought packed in a bag and put it in imaginary dumpster from where it gets burned to ashes.
Second method is ATTENTION DIVERSION…
When ever obsessive thoughts try to overcome, just divert your attention to something completely irrelevant. Like what your friend told you yesterday, what was the colour of your neighbour’s car, what was the zodiac sign of your best friend, when was the last time you bought something of blue color or google new upcoming movies….It can be anything…just divert your attention deliberately and keep doing it until you forget what else was going in your mind.
Finally and most importantly….CHANGE YOUR IRRATIONAL THOUGHTS INTO RATIONAL THOUGHTS…
Think about it, if u have disturbing thoughts and you have to perform rituals then what if you do not perform any ritual…
what will happen?what worse could happen? what if there are germs on your hand and you do not wash your hands, what will happen…let your hands get dirty in mud, and do not wash it…just try to take control over your mind….Tell your mind that “Its nothing but innocuous mud,nothing will happen to me, nothing is wrong with it,everyone has it, nothing happens to anyone”
Think for a moment that you have no problem, its just a random thought that comes and goes,do not react, don't overthink….
TRY TO CONTROL YOUR MIND
DON’T LET IT CONTROL YOU",OCD
1136,"To understand how our mind works.. And body
For example ..Just now, if we listen the news that, war has begain with Pakistan..
BP.... BP will fluctuate automatically.. But in different different levels... Like if some mother whose child is deployed on border.. And a normal women..
Bp level will be difference.. But why?
Because our subconscious mind like memories system know the consequences of war..
Same.. Your consciousness depends on the memories... Every disorder related to subconscious mind.. Because it has duty to serve thoughts like a restaurant..
Your all cells of body depends on the consciousness feeling..
..evert disorders is fault in machine..
Already spirituality has been declared that..
You are “cheetana“and your body is “jadh “
Jadh means no feelings in this body.. Only your consciousness has power to feel..
So, Don't worry and try to understand spiritual language..lot of material is available.
Last.. Research your own subconscious mind because it has unique because no other memories will match with it..
Thanks",OCD
1137,"Brave one step at a time. Get out of your comfort zone by doing something that bothers you and by experiencing different environments. Start slowly and then push yourself further. For instance, wait to wash your hands, shake someone else’s or do something that gets them dirty. Or maybe, don’t clean your house for a couple of days. After a while the small steps will add up. And when you’re more ready, do things that you wouldn’t normally do. Maybe you’re not an outdoors person? Have camping as a goal. Or if you’re feeling brave, go backpacking.
Learn about microbes. Everything is made up of smaller things. Space hosts stars, earth hosts us and we host them. Its uncomfortable but there is no way of changing or taking control of it, only accepting (not thinking too much about it if it bothers you) and working with it. Bacteria is needed for us to function. They’re our friends. Probiotics are needed in pill form as a response to us taking antibiotics and using antibacterial soaps. When we kill bacteria, we are killing both the good stuff with the bad stuff, and we need the good stuff to function. Interestingly, we may need some of the bad stuff too. Although not proven to be the solution, some people consume parasites to treat IBS. Regardless if it is a correct form of treatment, living too clean is actually bad for your health.
Take control of your life by letting go. Work through your underlining stress, you may want to journal or talk to a therapist. Be good to yourself and accept who you are and where your habits or beliefs and feelings are coming from. Take time to relax and center yourself, meditate or do yoga. Change and healing takes time and sometimes when we concentrate too hard on something it is all we can see. So balance is key. Take time to get out of your head and do activities that you enjoy.
Eventually you’ll find everything adds up and you’ve made remarkable strides.",OCD
1138,"Most people diagnosed with OCD don't have a fear of germs. Nor are they overly organized or tidy.
To be diagnosed with OCD, you needs 3 things:
Intrusive thoughts. These are thoughts that are not pleasant or wanted. They happen over and over, and cannot be “pushed” out of your mind. These thoughts are disturbing enough to raise your anxiety to uncomfortable levels.
An act to combat these thoughts. It may be physical or mental. You may feel the need to tap the counter. You may ruminate for long periods.
It happens enough to cause distress and problems in your life.
Everyone has intrusive thoughts. But most can ignore them or dismiss the idea rather quickly. Most of us have repetitive habits, but they don't interfere with our lives.
OCD can be debilitating without appropriate treatment.",OCD
1139,"Let me give you an example of how it changed the path of my life. I had a crippling case of OCD when I was in college, roughly from the ages of 17–21, during the years 1985–1989. (Although I had suffered from it even as a child)
There are many different types of OCD, but mine centered around not doing anything, mostly not hurting anyone, so that I would not end up in jail. It became difficult to drive, ride my bike, or even walk because every bump or irregularity in my path caused me to believe I had hurt someone. So my brain was never free from the panic that I was going to land in jail.
Now, to my example. Somehow, I had still managed to achieve an A average and was planning on pursuing a career as a college professor in Latin American History. The professor who was recommending me to the graduate history department was eager for me to do a good job on my GRE. This exam is like the SAT for graduate school.
The day came for me to take the test and I thought I would be okay. However, I was also suffering from a skin picking compulsion that is a form of OCD called excoriation. During the test I was so nervous I began picking my skin so badly that I was bleeding on the test. I panicked, thinking I might contaminate the people at the testing center. Further, strands of my long hair began to fall out and I was afraid that if I left them on the floor or desk that I might be convicted of a crime should one happen in that room after I left. So now my attention was definitely not on the test, but how to get the hell out of the room while taking the test with me. That was not allowed.
How did this change the path of my life?
As I thought would happen, when the test results came back, I was only scored in the 25th percentile. I did not get into grad school and was too embarrassed to try and explain what happened. I never did become a professor.",OCD

Take information using google,edit it and make it smaller(around 5-6 pages).

1142,"Look on the Wikipedia article and the Mayo Clinic page. Also go to the library and find a copy of the DSM IV or DSM V. Look at the International OCD foundation, What is OCD?.
OCD is basically an anxiety disorder. That is, people utilize the defenses of OCD (obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviors) to manage anxiety. Some people have obsessions, some have compulsions, some both. If they were be unable to do this they would be increasingly anxious.
I think of the character of Monk on TV as having some of these traits.

Important info about OCD would include the symptoms, how they impact people's lives, and what treatment methods have been shown to be effective.

Especially those stories that bring up him (Adrian) and his brother Ambrose Monk's interactions, which shows how such behavior can be manifested differently in individuals. But Ambrose's agoraphobia should not be seen as a necessary component of OCD. Nor should Adrian's controlling of people in his environment be considered a necessary component. But that controllingness is a part of his individual OCD.",OCD
1145,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

1146,"You can overcome OCD. How do I know? Because I did.
6 years ago, I could not walk out of a room without the mistaken belief that if I didn’t turn the lightswitch on and off 7, 8 or 13 times, my family would die as a result. I had a nervous twitch and I was struggling to look or ‘be’ normal. It affected me in my career and marriage.
Less than a year later (even though I had been diagnosed and had started CBT), I woke up one morning and understood that my behaviour was as a result of my thinking. And I didn’t have to pay attention to my thinking, because it was just thinking. Like feeling an itch and believing that if you don’t scratch it, you will explode. But if you feel the itch for what it is (an experience brought to you by a thought) and leave it alone… the itch goes. So too does the thought when left alone [thoughts are like the in-laws - they only stick around if you feed them].
And here’s where the ‘other’ ways of looking at this issue fall foul. Because as soon as you treat the thought as something that is real and needs to be dealt with, you lose your only power (choice) and give power to the thought. All of a sudden, that thought IS real and needs stopping or changing. Do you see where the problem is now? It’s in believing the thought is real in the first place.
So how did I wake up to my own mental torment (self-created and innocent)? Through an understanding of how the Human Operating System works - or in my case, being shown the Three Principles of Mind, Consciousness and Thought as uncovered by Syd Banks in 1973.
In his own words: “Nothing new”, but a new way to see what is already there (look inside for the answers you seek). I saw that my thinking was self created and innocently getting me to believe in it. That’s the power of the system right there, that we believe what we see as thought. It’s an illusion but it’s meant to look real. We have our very own CGI special effects department in our heads making the outside world look like it’s reality. But it’s only our version of reality. We ALL see things differently. 7.2 billion versions of life happening simultaneously.
Now on top of seeing this, there is a deeper implication of understanding how this operating system works. We are alive, therefore we are connected to infinite potential. Our solutions come to us when we have less on our minds. Which is why practises such as meditation help. Because our minds settle and new thinking emerges. Like it did for me that day back in 2011.
But meditation is not the answer. Because it suggests a ‘doing’. But meditation is our natural state of being. Peace is what’s left when everything else is removed. It’s there, hiding in plain sight. Just like our own mental health. It’s who we are, but for our years of innocently misinterpreted thinking layering on top, like covering a diamond in horse sh*t (thanks Michael Neill for that analogy!).
There is hope, because as soon as you see the illusion, you’re free.",OCD
1147,"I will tell you a trick. Anxiety in this situation means you are afraid of being laughed at, or messing up and having negative reactions and feeling rejected.
Try to imagine you giving your presentation. Every minute of it, make it like a video in your head. The first time imagine that you forget everything, the second time imagine you trip and fall, then imagine you doing whatever the worst fear you have is.
You have just survived the worst. As you imagine each thing, imagine what will happen, the teacher will be nice, the kids will not laugh, if they do, laugh with them. Most people are kind and helpful. Those that aren’t aren’t worth thinking about.
Nothing anyone else does can change who you are, your friends will still like you, your family will still love you and the sun will come up tomorrow.
You are now ready, one more thing, stage fright is normal for actors, almost every one has it, but the play goes on, they act their parts and the audience has no Idea that they barfed in the toilet just before going on. They are actors, they act.
Become an actor, don’t be a scared school kid, leave that character at home, the one in the front of the class has practiced their role and become their part.
For the future, know that anxiety is nothing but fear, you can pull fear’s fangs by realizing that you are as good as anyone just being yourself, if people don’t like what you do, too bad, that’s their problem, not yours.
Keep this in mind. When you walk into a room don’t worry if they will like you, what you should be thinking is, “I wonder if I will like them.”
Take good care, you will get through this.",OCD
1148,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",OCD
1149,"Let me say with full confidence: highly unlikely.
Here is why.
The heart of OCD is intrusive thoughts. Repetitive hurtful thoughts.
If you could dismiss those thoughts on your own then more power to you. But if you could dismiss them, you wouldn't have OCD.
Why do I say that? Because everyone has intrusive thoughts. We have all had a thought we don't like or are embarrassed or ashamed of. However the vast majority of people can move past that thought and not think of it again.
The OCD sufferer cannot do so. The thoughts are so prevalent that it will consume them. They cannot simply dismiss them. If they could then they would.
I won't go into how the intrusive thoughts (obsessions) lead to actions (compulsions). Just know for the OCD sufferer they do.
Therapy is key.",OCD
0,"Just thought I would share some things that have helped reduce the intensity of my OCD.

1. Running: When I notice that I’m spiraling and reassurance seeking (like obsessively googling in my case), I stop, get up, and go run a mile or two. This has been surprisingly effective for sort of nipping the obsession before it really explodes on me. 

2. Cold showers: Really ice cold showers, like unbearably cold, shocks me to my core so hard that it reduces anxiety for hours. It almost acts as a mood booster as well.

Doing this back to back has been super helpful for me. It really puts me in the moment and sometimes makes me forget about certain obsessions for several hours at a time. I used to get generally agitated when therapists I’ve had would suggest exercise, but it’s genuinely been really helpful. I definitely notice my mental health start to decline a bit if I haven’t worked out in a few days.",OCD

3,"Hi all!! 

I'm new to this subreddit, and was diagnosed with OCD only a few months ago. I don't really have access to CBT modules like that, though I am in therapy. 
I've recently been feeling very insecure about myself and am under a lot of stress, and I think this has been making my obsessive thoughts a lot worse and more intense. A lot of times I'll have a concern that is grounded in reality, but I ruminate over them over them to the point of completely warping them and my sense of reality also feels distorted. It's hard to distinguish between what is real or not. 
I go through cycles of it being really intense and then calming down and there being brief periods where I actually feel okay and able to emotionally regulate, but then it happens all over again. It's been getting better I guess? But these obsessive thoughts have really been affecting my relationships and behaviour, or at least that's how I feel. But it's really hard to break out of these thoughts because there's often a real concern somewhere mixed in. Or it has some moral quality to it that I do genuinely believe in but has become super warped. 
Does anyone else struggle with this? If so, do you have any tips/resources for dealing with this in a healthy manner? 

Thanks so much and I hope you all have a good day <3 ",OCD

6,"Hiya all! 
Lately I’ve had OCD like thoughts again 
And it’s hell 

Today I was at an ice cream shop and I was looking around when I saw a girl which was maybe like 10 years old 
She also was looking like the type of gf I’d like to have someday, 
I think I just saw her and was scared bc I had a strong focus on fearing I’d be a pedo lately so yeah, 
I think I did turn around then and tried to ignore it but I then turned around again. I don’t really know why exactly tbh 
Not bc I wanted to look again bc I was into her but I think it was because I wanted to confront it or reassure myself that I’m not interested in her 
I did maybe say or think that she’d be a pretty girl but not that I’d be attracted to her 
But to say that a child is pretty kinda is weird

Like I said I’m not 100% that’s the case 
I think it happened that way but i really don’t know for sure
I also don’t really know for sure whether I was interested in her or wanted to do anything 
I don’t really think anything would have happened or that I was interested  


What I know for sure is that I’m no pedophile, like I’m sure I’m no pedophile and that I want a gf that’s my age 

It’s so weird and exhausting tbh 
OCD makes me doubt myself, at first I was sure I wasn’t interested in her and now I’m not sure anymore, 
The whole fact that she would be the type of gf I’d want to have someday kinda makes it weird 

I wish I can just drop it and move on but it still scares me so much 
I even kinda did self harm again in the way that I scratched myself 
Idk why I share this tbh 
I know that seeking reassurance isn’t the right thing but I just can’t do it anymore 
I really just want to be a good person and have a loving gf someday and not a child as a gf or so (my ocd lets me doubt that while I type that lol) 
But I’m so damn scared help 
So if anyone got any advice, pls share

8,"I am going through a tough time right now and am wondering if anyone can relate. After years of struggling with religious OCD, it has largely shifted to death, Specifically: not existing after death. I have been looking through ERP resources, and everything that talks about death OCD is like ""oh, you must be afraid of how you will die, or of losing a loved one, or going to hell"". And, like, no. That isn't it. There is no ""what if"" thought here. It's not ""what if I die"" it's just ""one day I will be dead"" and that TERRIFIES me. I am having such a hard time figuring out what terrifies me. I feel like the most rational idea about what happens after death is nothing... and that scares me. I get vivid intrusive ""images"" of nothingness. Like, I get caught up trying to ""imagine"" what it is like to not have consciousness (impossible, I know!). I am just struggling and confused. I don't know how to do ERP because I don't really have a feared consequence. It is just the sheer fact of not existing terrifies me. It is haunting me tremendously right now. I don't need ERP based on how I will die or losing a loved one... I don't know what the ""core fear"" is. I am just terrified of not existing, plain and simple, and I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

9,"In 2023 I was diagnosed with magical OCD and severe depression, and I highly suspect that my OCD was caused by severe bullying by both teachers and students when I was in elementary school. I was placed in a special education program because I had autism the kids in this program were very violent kids that had anger issues so these kids would throw things at me yell at me curse at me spit at me, etc. and the teachers would always defend those kids and always telling my parents that I was the problem. I was the one causing the fights. One kid even told me to go kill myself just like how my friend did. I had a friend that committed suicide back in 2018 due to the severe bullying he was going through with those same kids and other mental health problems fast-forward to middle school. I was also bullied there by a bunch of kids that were mostly wanna be ghetto kids. These kids would tell me racist things offensive things throw shit at me assault me and the teachers were just the same as the ones in elementary school they would not defend me at all. My mom had enough and pulled me out of public school and now I am in a online school anyways let’s get to the OCD story my very first compulsion I can remember was a compulsion that I had to turn on a switch that was inside my head whenever I went to school and when I got home from school, there were two of them one mode was called school mode. The other mode was called home mode. In school mode, I basically couldn’t do anything I liked, for example if I wanted to make a drawing of one of my favorite fictional characters, I cannot do that or if I wanted to talk to a kid that has the same interests as me I can’t because if I did these soldiers will come and take one of my favorite fictional characters away from me to an undisclosed location. This is where they would contaminate them in a machine and once they’re contaminated, they’re basically covered in this black disgusting, almost bug light creatures, and the only way you could remove them is with this special imaginary vacuum that I made but while cleaning them off, you need to do it just right you need to do it perfect because if I didn’t, the bugs were just basically come back as if I didn’t even clean it. Home mode is basically where I could do. whatever I wanted to do, and it would only be turned on when I was at home, but there were also rules I could not mention anything about school or any school related thing or else the soldiers will come and take one of my favorite characters away so basically I felt like I was like someone who had to protect my favorite characters from these people who would harm them luckily in 2024 I managed to no longer do those compulsions, but I still have the fear of things being contaminated and if I break a rule, OCD gives me so in 2024 once I stopped doing all those past compulsions. I basically made a list of rules that my OCD cannot do and this list actually worked out for months. I had no problem with OCD for months that was until around September of last year. I started to feel very worried and depressed and I had no clue why once November came around. I started to have the feeling that one of my favorite characters Nick Wilde  worked for a school in the past and I had no clue so I tried to search that up to fact check my OCD but every time I try to read the yes or no answer. My OCD would say I didn’t read it right so I’d have to do it all over again and since then it’s been the same bullshit. I’m currently having a similar problem with the show SpongeBob so a few weeks ago, I shared my ideas for movies and shows to the Internet and I said that a show idea i had would be as weird as SpongeBob but my ocd began to freak out saying I just said that my show will be similar to a school related show. So I tried to search up if SpongeBob was a show about school or not and same reading problem ocd says I messed up and I have to reread. The reason why all of this is a big deal is because ocd believes that it has the power to contaminate things and make them off limits even though I have told it no. OCD still makes the rule that I cannot feature anything school related in my script ideas at all if it believe I have it will contaminate and make everything off limits I also don’t want to do any school related stuff in my scripts because I absolutely despise school after the bs I had to endure. Other compulsions I’m going through. I’m also trying to reset my mind but ocd always says I’m doing it wrong so I haven’t been able to do it properly and I’m in the middle of trying to write a updated version of the list of rules because some rules were missing in the old one. When I have to reset my mind that basically erases all the rules so there’s no rules my ocd can do whatever it wants kinda like the purge. I want to film my ideas and post them on YouTube but if my ocd doesn’t get better I’m afraid that in the future I’ll be a loser living in my parents house at 40 years old and doing nothing but staying in bed depressed. It’s literally crazy that like 9 years ago I was a kid enjoying my life and doing anything I wanted to do but since 2022 I’ve been questioning if I should go on disability or not because I genuinely don’t know if I’m able to get a job in the estate.",OCD

13,"Hi all, 
I wanted to share something with this community  that has been helping me in a way nothing has so far (even better than my erp therapy which i HIGHLY recommend btw) 

The book : Overcoming unwanted intrusive thoughts by Sally m Winston 

This book has answered nearly every single question I've had about thoughts, my emetophobia, obssessions, all of it. I love my therapist and erp so much but this has gone so into depth that truly, I urge anyone here who's looking for extra material/help to read this. Every chapter is full of so many helpful examples that make it so much easier to recognize when and why the thoughts are happening. The book does a fantastic job at making you feel seen, understood and accepted (something I feel alot of us struggle with because there's SO much stigma around ocd and anxiety)

 I'm able to recognize when I'm having intrusive thoughts based in anxiety so much easier now, able to put out the fire, and move on with my day. It has been particularly helpful for my lifelong emetophobia. I've been able to conquer alot more than I have in the last few years in combo with therapy and this book, and i feel like im just getting started. :D it feels so good to finally understand wtf has been going on in my brain for my entire life AND being able to learn how to relax, accept and release.

Truly, if you have time, read it. The pages and text are nicely spaced too, it feels good and easy to read.

I told him everything and he marked it right there so I could go home for the weekend without worrying and I got the score that I felt like I needed. However, I have exams coming up soon and some subjects I'm doing a lot worse in and I'm absolutely terrified for that period of time because I won't get them back for about 3 weeks. This has only become a thing recently and I have no idea why it came into play. I've been finding it harder to come into school because my intrusive thoughts are getting unbearable and I can't stop doing compulsions. I feel like my teachers, especially the one who marked my paper yesterday and all my classmates think I'm a freak because I have to do stupid compulsions in class that make me look weird and I feel like they all talk about me when I'm not in school which turns into a cycle of being too scared to come into school but not wanting them to think I'm weird for not being in. I don't want any reassurance on this because If anyone has any advice please feel free to share. I don't know who to talk to because I don't know what they can do. ",OCD
20,"Please no reassurance!

I have diagnosed OCD and I also think I have maladaptive daydreaming-- that is, I always have some sort of imagined scenario that is like the default thought in my brain for a given period of time-- usually a couple positive and a couple negative. Super super distracting even when good. 

Recently, I have spent literally any time when my brain is not actively thinking about something going over two main negative imagined scenarios that are sort of a follow up to conflicts that actually happened with people, ie like imagining what I would say, repeating it over and over with slight variations. It's like being in an extremely upsetting/angering argument 24/7 that keeps me in constant fight or flight. 

Honestly driving me crazy. This has happened most of my life, but more now. I have a pretty decent amount of practice with mindfulness and ERP, but I have a hard time with pure O/mental compulsions because I'll realize I'm thinking those things literally every like 2 minutes all day but I'll go back to thinking about it 10 seconds later. I can handle it if I'm like sitting down doing a meditation with my eyes closed, but just doing regular stuff it is so annoying (and I do also try to practice mindfulness throughout the day). 

I can't tell exactly how to exposure therapy this-- I know for mental compulsions you can imagine the upsetting thought over and over again until it feels meaningless for exposure, but given that I dive into it so deeply and it's not like a super distressing thought that I immediately push away, it doesn't seem like that's responding to the root of the compulsion? I don't know if acknowledging the thought and moving away would turn into pushing it out of my mind tho. 

Would be curious if anyone has been successful in something similar.",OCD
21,Why is this so widely said? That it can only be dealt with and not cured... like I've literally seen the opposite happen to multiple people,OCD
22,"Man, I know it isn't healthy but am starting to hate people.



These guys don't know the struggle people with mental illnesses go through however, still they wanna give advice like they know jacksh*t


People privileged with healthy body and mind going around how we are just making excuses for our disorders.



I didn't have a good childhood, people taking advantage of me, so much physically abuse  and emotional neglect just from the age of 5. And other stuff I can't even mention....


Recently I made a post about how tough is it to live with ocd and trauma; if people didn't wanna read it, just scroll past bro, is this that hard to understand? Why you gotta go out to make mean comments.


Not joking, some person even baffled ""i have p*rn addict*on, I don't go around complaining. ""


I don't get much angry but what the actual fu*k man?? Do you not have enough common sense some person severely depressed would get even more discouraged reading this cr*p.


Oh and oh boy don't talk about depression, it's like buffword thrown around everywhere. People feeling just a bit sad = depression to them. Are you fkin joking? Listen, I am sorry that you are having a bad day, but please just don't use a mental condition to define your health, cuz it isnt that bad that you claim its depression, atleast just use ""feeling depressed"", instead of self diagnosing. 



Sorry, just wanted to rant.....",OCD
23,"So this is what is going on, I have BPD as well as OCD. Have a lot of other shit but this is what I’m working on right now. During exposure therapy during Thursdays session, I had a really bad bpd episode. I was yelling and cursing and just overall not being a nice human. The board of directors called me and said 

“You have to be a good person in order to be in this program, if you have another bpd episode we can no longer help you.” 

Okay, so Thursday I beat myself up. Hating on myself, thinking that there is no way I can get help and that I should just isolate because I don’t want to have another episode and hurt others with my words. 

So, during yesterdays session, I wrote down my DBT skills, when I need to use them and session, and worked up a plan, that if I need a break, great, ask for one. The way I behaved on Thursday did not align with my values. Yelling and cursing should not be directed or allowed and I agree. Therefore, I am not giving up. 

I was going to just cancel treatment all together but you know what the reality is that I have severe OCD and BPD. Asking myself: What can I do now to try and prevent this from happening in session again? How can I manage my splits during an exposure? 

I am overall proud of myself for not giving up. Yes I had a bad moment, but that doesn’t make me a bad person. It just means that I need to take a step back, and re access what it is that I can do, do make this treatment possible. 

Btw I go in two hours a day 5 days a week. So, I ask myself, in the time that I am not in therapy. How can I better myself so that I can continue this program. 

Looking for some advice, encouragement, or anyone whose been here. Much love ",OCD

26,"I've been diagnosed with severe OCD, and yet today I've spent all morning obsessively checking whether or not I have OCD, as well as engaging in compulsions for my theme. I've currently obsessed with the idea that I don't have OCD, I'm just a master manipulator and am manipulating everyone around me to not think that I'm a narcissist/criminal/evil person. I hate this so much, I'm exhausted and am just so sick and tired of this horrible disease. I wish I didn't have it. I know a key part of recovering from OCD is to stop trying to push away the illness and come to terms living with it, but it's just so difficult to do. It's so hard to resist a compulsion when my OCD is telling me that I might have done something terrible, and need to check again to make sure that I haven't done it. 

I'm venting on here because I'd just really like some kind support. No reassurance seeking, just people commiserating and encouraging me to keep going because it feels so hard. ",OCD
27,"I have had OCD since the age of 6 and I can happily say that now, over 20 years later, I finally feel like I'm in control of my life again the majority of my days. And while OCD does strike back every now and then, in varying severity, I am very often able to control it before it controls me. Hopefully, this post can you help, inspire or just remind you of some helpful practices.

*I am not a professional, just someone like you and me who has learnt from the struggle. OCD and building tools for managing your mental health and whether and how they work and affect you are a personal experience so bear in mind its important to pay attention to how you feel. I am sharing some things that worked especially well for me, personally.*

Also, please remember that recovery from OCD or any other mental illness is not linear. Don't beat yourself up if you don't get it right every day. Or when it decides to just randomly come back after a period of weeks or months free of compulsions. I fully believe in the fact that the more you learn about OCD operates and what tools help you personally, the quicker you will notice when it decides to sneak its way back into your everyday life and the more you will be able to help yourself get up when you fall.

The goal is not to eliminate it, but to live with it. Funny enough, when I shifted my pespective like that. it kind of eliminated itself.

**Understanding how OCD operates**

I cannot stress enough the fact that learning and understanding how OCD works has helped me incredibly along the journey. What initially used to be random severe anxiety that I couldn't pinpoint or comprehend as a child & teenager and would throw me off the path for weeks is now something that I have studied within myself & understand when it starts doing its thing. This is such a huge difference. It doesn't mean it will ""go away"" forever. But it means that when it comes to the surface, I know what it is and how to manage it. I am able to very quickly differentiate between just my thoughts and thoughts OCD likes to declare as ""something that needs to be fixed right now"". It loses power. It takes a LOT more for it to pull me back into the cycle. As if I've invested in leveling up my armor and its attacks against me barely scratch my HP bar now.

The earlier you see the pattern & the earlier you seek help the quicker you will be able to recover. If you don't have access to therapy right now, don't give up. A lot of people, whether in your surroundings or on the internet will be able to relate & help you. The fact that you're reading this means you've already looked out for them. Even if people have other mental health related problems, often, the things we have to do to bring ourselves back to the present overlap and align. My brother, for example, dealt with GAD & panic attacks - he talked about the tools he and his therapist created to manage that experience and in the end, it would inspire and help me with managing & tackling my own issues.

The content of your OCD manifestation does not matter - it is always the same cycle. OCD is like an overactive alert-system. Thoughts exist regardless of having OCD or not, they are there, passing by like clouds. A constant flow, in and out of your field of view. To me it feels like a system glitch in my brain, where it likes to focus on one of these clouds and say ""this is a threat this is dangerous, it needs to be fixed, alert, alert"". (Meanwhile the cloud just being like ""\~ (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶) \~"", haha). But in reality, it's just a thought like any other thought you have. OCD starts paralyzing you the moment your respond to that alert. ""I must fix this"". Then you will attract the cloud and it would surround you and everything will become foggy and scary because you can't see anything, for as long as you give it attention. Especially with things that make you feel uncertain, It doesn't matter if you find a ""solution"" to the problem. Because whether you found a solution or not, once you stop paying attention to it, it will go back on its path and float away. Have you ever spend hours and hours on getting rid of a thought or feeling or trying to find a solution to something only to forget about it literally 10 minutes after you're ""done"" dealing with it? That's the thing. The false alert causes a scary reaction of anxiety but your response to it is what causes these cycles that paralyze you.

**Building tools**

I know that mindfulness practices (focusing on your senses, journaling, meditation, you name it have proven are very well known and often proven be very helpful with anything we are tackling our mind about. Not just OCD. But it can help anyone and some things even more so with OCD.

It can be tiring to here ""just meditate"" or ""just go outside"" every day, but I'd like to share a bit about how some of these things have helped me immensely. We can be creative with these tools and do them our way, it's not that black or white. There's a few things but I think I can point out 3 major practices that have really done the difference for me, personally.

1. The mindfulness jar

This is a tool we worked out for me during cognitive-behavioural therapy. We called it the ""treasure chest"" initially. My task was to figure out some things I can do very easily and that don't take a lot of commitment. Actions that made me feel good and helped me focus on my senses and be more present again, so the brain fog (which can be OCD cycles, for examples) can dissolve easier. I bought a cute little glass jar with a lid and wrote these actions on small paper notes, folded them and put them in.

Every day at 6 PM I have a reminder going off that tells me to draw a random note, no matter what. And then I have to do it. It helps to keep it very simple, so when you are overwhelmed or stuck in a loop it is easier to get started. For me it was things like ""Go outside"", ""Meditate"", ""Play an instrument"", ""Listen to ambience"". It doesn't have to be any of these things, but if you know they make you feel good, then it's a good choice. One of the notes tells me to boot up a game called Coloring Pixels and then I just color by numbers in quiet for a moment, because that game is literally an on/off switch for my brain. So I put it on a note! You can do the same for whatever bring you a moment of calm or joy.

Even if it's just 10 minutes a day, these actions are acutal breaks for your brain. A chance to be present for a moment again and not think or worry about whatever is happening in your life right now, or tomorrow, or next month, or what your brain is hyperfixating on right now. Just a moment of simplicity. It will give your mind a breather, some space, and you will have more clarity in the long run.

The important part is to do & stick to it, no matter what. I don't get it right all day, even now, but I don't beat myself up over it. To me this felt especially good for OCD because you won't know what you're gonna draw and you're gonna have to do it, even just 10 minutes, exposing you to a healthy amount of uncertainty. And every time you manage to do it you're reminded that the choice did not matter AND it also felt good. Over time, this will help condition your brain to deal with other uncertainties in your every day life. I could really feel that effect, even after a short time of doing this. It's like a work out for your mind.

2, Nature

The first time I consistenly felt the impact of an action on my every day life, positively, was when I did leave my apartment. Every day. ""The stupid walk for my stupid mental health"". I do enjoy walks, even just short ones. For me personally it was important to be out in nature, not the city. But this is also depends from person to person.

I was lucky enough to live and the outer district of a town so I had fields and a brook nearby. I'd go there every day and it was almost impossible for me to not slow down, eventually. There's a lot of sensations like leaves rustling in the wind, animals, noises like splashes or water or maybe just someone walking their dog close by. I would walk very fast initially. But at some point I started to stroll. I took a deep breath, smelled the fresh air or sun on my skin.

All these sensations distracted ME from what OCD wanted me to focus on. Normally OCD would declare that if I don't ""deal"" with the problem I am just distracting myself. But then, it flipped around. Same as before, the more often I'd do this, the more my brain would learn that the threat in my mind is not really a threat. Even if you don't think about or capture that realization anywhere, you will internalize it.

3. Meditation

Same as with walks, meditations would make me feel similar to how walks would made me feel. Just a lot more focused and intensely. When you meditiate you actively do nothing other than paying attention to your existence. Guided meditation would always do well for me, but this also depends on your preference. This is as much ""focussing on your senses"" as it gets - and when you have a brain that is incredibly overactive and in lack of rest, this will feel incredibly good if you can roll with it.

I never thought that I'd engage in meditation regularly or even look forward to it and I had to give it quite a few tries before it did the thing for me. It's not for everyone. Now I literally think about planning trips or hikes one day, just to find a beautiful spot in the world to feel & appreciate the moment in. And this is quite something, coming from someone who spends most of his time indoors, immersed in playing video games or making music, since his childhood.

But I would definitely say giving this a thorough try is really worth it. Sometimes it would feel like I put my mind to sleep for a bit. And when I would get out of the meditation my mind was blank. I was just here, present. And it felt so, so, so good. Again, my brain learnt there is no threat. I am safe.

**Pitfalls to watch out for with OCD**

It took me a lot of trial and error to figure out what works and what doesn't work so well for me. Especially with OCD, it was easy for me to question very specifically what I should do and how I should do it. But again, some of the practices would teach me: the specifics don't matter too much, just the feeling.

Some tools, I learnt to be very careful with. My journal for example. What started as a little idea to write down things that happen in my life spiraled into ""oh I just had this really important thought that I don't wanna forget and I must write it down right now"". The same thing happened to my ""good thoughts jar"" (I had two at that point) where I would capture positive thoughts. The problem? I wrote down things that would reassure me. So I turned that tool into a reassurance machine. We come up with tools to manage or reduce or fear of something and then it just feeds the OCD and turns into a compulsion.

So that's definitely the most vaulable lesson I've learnt about tools and practices in your own environment. This got a lot better when I started paying attention to how my tools make me feel. I looked at my journal and felt uneasy. Or I constantly tackled my brain about whether I should get rid off or keep a tool when I didn't know whether it still served me or not. When that happens, it is very likely the tool is not serving you anymore but you are serving it, which is a good time to get rid of it. In some other scenarios where it wasn't so black & white, it would help to shift those tools to still be there in a way that is less intrusive or in my face. And then I would always appreciate it & not fear it.

Spreadsheets for example are double-edged swords for me. Sometimes I like keeping track of something (shows & movies my partner and I watched for example) - but when I felt like I HAVE to track things every time or check the sheet before I could make a decision, that tool will turn into something that will hold you back. That's usually a good sign that OCD is having a grip on you. I couldn't play video games before checking and updating my tracker beforehand every time, causing decision anxiety & killing spontaneity as I couldn't just boot up a game anymore, I had to check and work through the tracker first and had to choose something that is in the backlog.

And here's the thing about not just getting rid of some tools - I knew I would want to have some kind of overview over all my games. So instead of just stopping the tracking which I liked, I got rid of the sheet, but I kept sorting my games on my consoles & launchers individually. Always pay attention to whether a tool or habit makes you feel good. If you feel like you have to live by the tools rules then its usually worth considering if it still serves you. This process takes time but after a while, you'll find yourself building an environment that is free of OCD triggers and you'll definitely and very quickly feel when you start making more decisions based on how you feel and what you want to do right now.

Again, I am not a professional but I hope that just sharing a piece of my journey could help, inspire or remind you to take care of and maybe see something that you couldn't see before yourself, too. If so, I'm more than happy and if not, I'm more than happy to hear your thoughts, wisdoms or perspectives on this. We are stronger together!

29,"I got diagnosed professionally with this illness when i turned 21. I've been on medication before in the past and i unfortunately don't have proper access to therapy.

So much of this disorder has plagued my life and i still refuse to let it win. I have a lot of trauma because of it. Does anyone else feel like this sometimes?... it's stupid to me. I just want to have that special feeling of being normal for once. The symptoms have seemed to lesson now that i'm 24. But ugh. I know to not fight back with it because that's giving what it wants. What medications do you take to treat the ""extreme"" aspects of your symptoms (if there's any)... i'm willing to try almost anything after having an awful experience with zoloft.

30,"A few months ago, I had a severe OCD breakdown after working 80 hours a week. My panic disorder with agoraphobia came back full force, and my OCD completely exploded. Now, I have different OCD themes. It started as existential OCD, but then I became scared that my panic attacks were caused by something other than OCD, which triggered health OCD.

At one point, I started thinking, What if my food is poisoned? Even though I knew rationally this wasn’t true, the thought sometimes stopped me from eating. I also avoided raw salmon because I was afraid of getting salmonella. Now, I’m scared that I have schizophrenia.

He says he relate because when laves the apartment he has to check everything 4 times. 4 sounds fucking amazing. So I asked if got anxiety if he resisted this urge. He didn't. So i asked if thougt a lot about it the whole day. He said only for a few minutes. So obviously he has absolutely no idea at ALL about how i feel. He also said it's the only thing where he checks. Again, has nothing to do with OCD

34,"Hello, folks. I don't go on this sub a lot but I thought I'd share my recovery story in case it helps anyone.

For context, I'm 29 yo and the past three years have been eye-opening for me. I've had OCD probably since I was seven. I remember, after the death of my dad, I started touching and tapping things out of fear that my mum would die too if I don't perform the rituals right. As a teenager and young adult, I used to do all sort of compulsions to calm thoughts that'd tell me I'm dying, my family is dying and that I'm a terrible person. I sought professional help but was told it was just anxiety. Therapists got me to reflect on the intrusive thoughts, which only fuelled my compulsions. 

Three year ago, my ocd was at its worse. I was doing compulsions almost all of the time, which got so bad I stopped leaving the house. It is then I decided that something needed to change. I did some research and stumbled upon the word, ocd, by accident, and everything clicked. It described me perfectly. Until then, I hadn't thought about recovery or trying to change. This is how things had been for so long, I thought there was nothing that can be done. But almost every article I read mentioned ERP and I knew I had to try. If there was even a small chance that something might help me, I had to try. 

I started seeking targeted OCD therapy. Over the course of 8 months, I saw two different therapists that specialised in OCD and although their guidance was useful, about 95% of my recovery work happened outside our sessions. I had to stop the compulsions and so I tried and failed. I tried again and failed again. In the beginning, it seemed like every compulsion I stopped was replaced by another one. I'd go outside but I'd ruminate. I'd stop ruminating but then google symptoms, just in case. It felt like a constant uphill battle.

But a year passed, and I felt better. I still engaged in compulsions but I was functional. But that wasn't the end. About January last year, I had a relapse and, although I was still able to go to work and see friends, I became detached and anxious. Enough was enough. What I was doing was obviously not enough, so I sat and reflected on my actions, and I realised I was performing a lot of mental compulsions. I was constantly floating the intrusive thought in my mind in order to check how I feel and prove it's not real. This is the point at which I realised the true meaning of 'letting go'. It meant not attaching to the thought, letting it float around in my head while I carried on focusing on the things I wanted to focus on. 

It also meant accepting the feeling the thoughts elicited. people tend to get confused about this because they often think that accepting a feeling means accepting it's real. But that's far from true. Accepting the feeling means you let that feeling be present in your body without trying to get rid of it. It feels uncomfortable not washing your hands after you've touched a door knob? That's ok, let that feeling exist while you go and focus on the more important things that need doing. 

It was hard work, but the more I focused on things that were important to me, like hobbies, friends and work, the less prevalent the intrusive thoughts and feelings became. It's been three and a bit months now and my OCD is barely noticeable. I still get intrusive thoughts and feelings but I care less about them. I don't feel the need to perform rituals to get rid of them and at times, just the thought of having to prove an intrusive thought wrong feels like gargantuan effort. 

At my worst, I used to dream about a world with no intrusive thoughts and anxiety, but now I live a full life despite them. They have space to exist in the periphery of my consciousness, just like all other thoughts and feelings. I now know that life has its ups and downs. You can't always be happy and fulfilled. Some days suck. What's important is knowing you have the strength to persevere and that no feeling lasts forever. Put in the effort to build resilience",OCD

38,"this is my first time posting here although i’ve been a long time lurker and have found such helpful coping mechanisms here.

i’ve struggled with this really badly ever since i was a child. for example i was super into sharks as a kid and my family would always take me to the aquarium where there was an option to dive with the sharks. my parents asked me once if that was something i’d be interested in and i was adamant that no, i did not want to do it. but it sparked this whole obsession within me that my brain would disconnect from my body and i’d say yes even though i didn’t want to and i’d be forced to do it at my own hand.

i suppose it’s so difficult because of the lack of control i feel over my own actions all the time. i know part of treatment is giving up that control but man is it difficult! i also feel like it impedes me so severely in life because i never know what my own choices are and what my ocd is forcing me to do or to be afraid of. so i’m just overly cautious all the time and i get scared thinking that this is stopping me from reaching my full potential or doing things that i do want to do! 

i guess i’m just struggling a lot lately with the lack of control and it’s causing a lot of mental compulsions - i’m on citalopram which has helped me quite a bit but this feels like something that will never go away or something i’ll never learn to deal with. i’m trying to have hope but it’s tiring :( i hope anyone who is struggling with something similar know that they are not alone in this ",OCD

My OCD is slaughtering me despite the flu with the fear that if I don't do things right I'll end up in hospital, I'm alone I have no one, do you have any advice for me to deal with these days where everything is multiplied? Even a piece of advice some good words or a tactic are very welcome

41,"Hello everyone, during my journey, starting from wanting to understand more about my retroactive jealousy in romantic relationships, I had to realize and accept the pathological aspects of my behaviors, and through therapy, come to terms with seriousl mental health conditions like OCD, BPD, Narcissist Personality Disorder (NPD) etc.

As we all know, obsessive research, affected by cognitive bias (where we go looking for confirmations rather than for information), and aggravated by the urge of seeking answers and reassurance, is a core theme with OCD.

Anyway, I wanted for some time to read this article about Retroactive Jealousy and OCD, [Journal of Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders - Haunted by the ghosts of romance past: Investigating retroactive jealousy through the lens of OCD] and I bought the rights and contents in order to read it.
It was an interesting read, and the part saying **A recent model of OCD holds that obsessional doubt occurs because people with OCD have difficulty accessing their internal states and therefore rely on proxies to resolve their distressing doubt (Lazarov, Dar, Oded, & Liberman, 2010).** had me curious and I was surprised of how many results were available by looking up the mentioned text.

On top of that, during my CBT therapy sessions, we didn't cover the subject with my therapist, and this had me even more curious.

I wanted to share this for all the people who might find it helpful, always keeping in mind the difference between getting a new information, and the obsessive reassurance seeking, which is dangerous and reinforce the negative cycle of OCD.

42,"Hello! I have LOTS of questions about this disorder. Realized that I 100% have it in December (and it has ruined my life even more since then, but that's not important), and some of the questions stem from my own experiences. I hope this post isn't too much! I also hope I chose the correct flair lol

1. What is the fastest time one can recover? Does it take a minimum of 12 months (1 year)? 
2. When someone recovers from OCD, is it possible for them to develop it again later in life?
3. If someone thinks of something bad, but they disagree with it, is it still counted as an intrusive thought if they try their best not to stress themselves out? (I hope this doesn't come out as reassurance seeking)
4. Does OCD only, or at least mostly, catch things that you can't predict (Such as, things in the future) / can't be solved by logic?
5. Do you think OCD can cause psychosis, and would you agree that if someone believes they actually did something (when it's actually false memory), it could be psychosis or at least similar?



I don't know how to end this off, just some questions I had. Any answers could be appreciated!",OCD
43,"I'm a little confused. I had an intrusive thought about something terrible and I basically just said whatever and watched a funny YouTube video. Is this ERP or a compulsion? Sorry for the dumb question, I just wanna make sure I'm not avoiding and I can continue doing this in the future. It felt really freeing. ",OCD
44,"Running is one of my best tools for managing my OCD. All my intrusive thoughts come out of the woods, and I have to confront them, return to my breath and the sound of my footsteps when the slope gets too steep, then push forward again. If you can run, I truly believe you should!

45,"Hi! Does anyone else notice that when they are extremely busy with work, etc. their OCD isn’t that bad, but when work calms down or life calms down it flares up really badly?

46,"So I was recently diagnosed with OCD and feel I have noticed some OCD symptoms since I was a child (mostly feeling I had to put something a certain way or bad things would happen). I have also had symptoms since a child of low motivation to do chores, cleaning, homework, etc, and daydreaming in class. So while I'm certain I have OCD I'm wondering if these additional symptoms can also be OCD or if perhaps I may suffer from something else as well. Just wondering if anyone else has had issues with these things. ",OCD

48,"Apologies in advance if this post is somewhat haphazard.

Ten years ago, my mother passed away suddenly from cancer. It was only a month from diagnosis that she died. From the moment she told me that her diagnosis was terminal, it was like my brain shut off all my emotions. It remained like that until several months after she died, and I found myself locked in a series of OCD obsessions and ruminations that brought my life to a standstill.

Even though I'm sure the worsening of my symptoms was due to bereavement, I don't feel like I actually processed what happened. It was like it was all a distraction from what the loss actually meant. I spent years in a state of self-loathing, which was gradually replaced by a general anxiety towards life in general, like it didn't feel ""safe"" and each theme that came up was proof of that.

Two years ago, my grandmother died. It was on the same day that my mother died. I was still struggling with one of my themes when it happened, and only got rid of it the following year by doing a compulsion which seemed to stop it.

In December last year I had a really bad episode that I couldn't perform compulsions to deal with. But this time, the stress brought being bereaved to the forefront of my mind. 

It's like a sick, lonely, lost feeling. It feels like I've just lost them both. I feel like there's no purpose to living without them. I'm still relatively young, so I could spend the majority of my life without them. The thought of that is unbearable. It's like an elephant is standing on my chest. I'm not motivated to self-care or anything. My flat looks like a bomb went off, but cleaning it just feels beyond me.

My life viewed objectively is not that bad, it will take some getting together but it's okay. But it just feels hopeless and insurmountable.

TL;DR I feel like OCD blocked my grieving process for years with a succession of different rumination themes, and now the sense of loss is hitting me I feel crushed and lost, even though a lot of time has passed. I don't know what to do.",OCD
49,"For context I have not been diagnosed but have made the step to speak to a GP to get help ( a win :) but for now I cannot stop myself from constantly researching to find out if my thoughts are true or not. This path month I’ve had a hard time sitting with thoughts. Today for example I woke up late 12:30pm and essentially spent up until now 4:39pm researching and using ChatGPT to figure out if my thoughts are true. 

I am CONVINCED I am loosing my marbles. Anyone else like this? I just feel like I’m stuck in a tunnel of overthinking it’s terrible. I basically feel like I f’d myself up by falling into this cycle. ",OCD

51,"Hi all, I’ve been feeling like my fluoxetine has stopped being as helpful as it used to be. Is this a sign I need to go up in dosage or maybe try a different med?

Here’s the situation. I got on fluoxetine last spring for OCD and anxiety, with a history of depression, particularly in the winter months. I have tried a lot of medications over the years and overall I tend to be pretty sensitive to meds and have to go low and slow when changing anything. I started pretty low taking one 10mg cap every other day eventually working up to one 20mg cap per day by the start of August 2024. I noticed an immense improvement in my overall anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions. 

Things were going pretty great, it felt like a miracle drug until the start of December. I got a new job which has been way more stressful than I anticipated and I got Mono (likely mid November, but wasn’t symptomatic until mid December). Having Mono has been brutal, I’m exhausted, isolated, not engaging in my hobbies and expending all my energy trying not to jeopardize my new job, despite needing to reduce my hours temporarily due to fatigue. Not to mention it has caused flairs of multiple chronic conditions I manage, which has been an added misery.

Understandably I’ve been feeling down, very similar to a mild depressive episode which has been tolerable. But recently my anxiety has skyrocketed and my obsessions/compulsions are back, not quite as bad as before but definitely disruptive. This is a lot harder for me to cope with than the depressed feelings, and it interferes more with my functioning (at work and day to day). I know that the circumstances of my life (stressful job, being sick, feeling alone) are likely contributing to these symptoms arising, but it feels like the Prozac is no longer holding them at bay.

 Could it be that it is losing its effect? Would it make sense to try a higher dose? Am I just on a hamster wheel where I will have to increase my dose again and again until I max out and then have to switch meds and start over? Anyone have similar experiences. If you made it this far, thanks for reading💛

57,"Hi, so I’ve recently been diagnosed with OCD (I suspect I’ve had it since around hs, I’m 24 now), but my OCD has been flaring up again since my dog recently passed. I usually have intrusive thought loops surrounding death, specifically my parents’, and I’m very anxious about them passing. My dog passed very suddenly 5 days ago, and now I’m constantly thinking about my parents and how they’re getting older, and my brain keeps telling me my parents will suddenly pass away every time I’m away from them. I still live with my parents, and am trying my best to be with them every second I have, but the issue now is that I can’t be alone without getting this sickening feeling in my stomach that I have to be spending time with them.

58,"Hi all,

I am wondering if anyone can help with this. I took 10mg prozac with success for about 8 years, combined with cbt/mindfulness and was in a good place with ocd. I went off a few times but always returned with success. A few years ago the prozac wasn't helping, so I upped the dose to 20mg and experienced intense racing thoughts and rumination. Ever since, I have tried 10mg prozac, celexa, and now clomipramine and have experienced similar symptoms. All these meds have made my mind more hyper active and worsened ocd. I will probably try SSRIs again, has anyone had a similar history with being successful on one drug then nothing else? Thank you.

59,"I keep remembering this time in middle school where I bumped into a girl. I have different versions of the memory going through my mind. 

In one version, I saw the collision coming and wanted to collide to feel a breast. My friend earlier in the year said he accidentally bumped into a girl and did this. So I think that’s what implanted the idea. I asked him if he did it on purpose because I thought it was wrong to do, and he said it wasn’t on purpose.

In another version, I saw the collision coming but couldn’t make myself move out of the way. I kept worrying about what I was doing? Like “oh she can’t get over, or I don’t have to move if we collide we collide” Am doing this on purpose? It’s like I was in a panic and going through the motions.

I really worry I intentionally groped this person, and I don’t know how to get over it. I feel like a monster.

60,"Hi everyone, I feel a bit silly posting this, if it breaks any rules I am fine with deleting it.

Today I picked up a dead bat (stupid, but I thought it was only live ones you had to worry about). I found it dead in my garage, so I picked it up and put it in the bin outside, and then went inside and washed my hands 3 times to be safe. Then I googled if picking up dead bats is safe and realised it's not. So then I started spiralling about rabies. Though I have no cuts, I thought 'what if it licked its fur before dying and I touched the fur and then I touched my mouth', and I got so stressed I phoned my local health department and after questioning they told me I was very low risk and didn't need shots (but they didn't say zero risk).

I would honestly take the shots just to put my mind at rest. Such cases from bats can take years to kill, so now I am worried I'm gonna live the next two years panicking every time I have flu symptoms. But I can't have the shots because it was already determined that I don't need them.

I guess I am kind of writing this to get it off my chest, and if anyone else has been in a similar scenario, especially people with health OCD, I would love to hear it - I don't need reassurance (because I know it's enabling) I just want to know how others dealt with their health OCD.

62,"Title is probably misleading, but I constantly think about how I could potentially die. I fear death. I don’t want to die. I have so much left to do. But I’m scared. And I think about death at least once every day. This started about two years ago—which I think aligns with the time I started developing signs of OCD. When I was going through a rough patch a while ago, I would think about dying almost constantly throughout the day for 4-5 months. Who would come to my funeral? Who will pay for it? How will my family and friends find out I’ve died? Who will find me? What if I die on the way home from work? Driving incidents are common. Maybe a tragic plane crash during my upcoming trip? What if I get kidnapped because I didn’t lock my door while sitting in my car? I’m scared to die. I’m scared to die. I’m scared to die. I’m scared to die. I’ve done so much, I can’t let it all go to waste. 

I don’t know what to do to stop these thoughts.

64,"Our 6 year old daughter started asking repetitive questions in early January, then around January 25th we noticed a number of other compulsions that seemed to compound over night. We had her tested for strep and she was an asymptomatic carrier. We have an appointment set up with a PANDAS specialist in ten days and will get her in ERP, but I’m freaking out that it seems to be progressing still after 2.5 days of antibiotics (she’s on a ten day course but I see that pandas physician association recommends longer, and hope/expect we’ll get it extended since the site also says some improve between 1-2 weeks.

My fears and questions include:

1) What is a normal progression for OCD at this age? She had 3 weeks of questions that suddenly compounded to several compulsions (largely related to food and poison), now seems to be building with separation anxiety. We’ve seen sporadic vocal tics but could just be her light runny nose causing throat clearing, and she’s woken up to pee the last week which she NEVER has done but mostly has been close to morning. Could this be a standard non-strep OCD progression?

Would your POV change if you (as we did this week) learned that she’s been having the thoughts without sharing or any compulsions since late Oct, and one time voiced a fear that something was poisoned in Mid December?


2) If your kid had PANDAS and you caught it early… do you remember when antibiotics started to provide relief? I need some hope.


3) My son who is 4 also tested positive for strep. He’s usually a very chill dude and he has some minor accidents here and there (mostly sharts, honestly) — but in the past week he has peed his pants 3x, and he’s been having uncharacteristic meltdowns… should I be worried about him re: PANDAS?

65,"Hey everyone. I am M29. OCD runs in my family on my mom's side and I have suffered from it to varying degrees over my life, although it was much worse when I was younger, before I was finished high school. For instance, I couldn't leave the house without checking each oven dial 16 times to ensure that it was off, or that the door was locked 16 times, etc etc.

As I grew older, I learned to either deal with or master my symptoms and I hardly even thought about it. Recently, however, I've been going into a bit of a compulsion riddled tail spin and I have been very anxious and stressed.

At work (i work at a mechanics shop) our air conditioning refrigerant machine was leaking, so I was exposed to refrigerant gases at work 6 or 7 times at fairly low concentrations in a fairly big space but with the doors closed because its winter. 

Herein lies my compulsion;  my OCD primarily manifests itself as hypochondria, and I am hyperfixating on the nature of my exposure to this refrigerant; I can't stop reading scientific studies and toxicologocal reports on these chemicals, even though all available literature states that they are not carcinogenic. I keep posting in reddits related to hvac and refrigerant to ask about my experience, even though all the comments tell me not to worry and that I'll be fine. I keep worrying that I am going to fall gravely ill and perish, even though I've read so many reasons why I shouldn't feel this way.

As soon as I feel a little better with time, I get the compulsion to make new posts, or read the same toxicological reports I've read and just stress myself out all over again, even though everything I read tells me I shouldnt worry. 

I have two young kids, and even when we're playing together as a family having fun I can't shake the compulsive thoughts in the back of my mind that these chemicals are going to give me cancer and kill me, even though I only breathed them in a couple of times and not a huge amount.

I haven't dealt with my OCD to this extent in a long while, and I guess I'm just looking for tips on how best to deal with this. I'm not interested in medication, as I don't take medication for anything else and I never needed it before. In the past, I could just strongarm my compulsions and not submit to them. Is that the same answer here? Is it as simple as stop reading reports and experiments and stop googling chemical properties, gas propagation, etc?

66,"Hi all! 

I’m having chronic anxiety for about a week or two that causes me to spiral. My therapist believes I have OCD. 

My biggest fear is going into psychosis or having schizophrenia. Sometimes, when I have a paranoid thought or intrusive image, it makes me feel like I’m losing control of my mind and I can’t focus. My inner voice (my therapist calls the OCD voice) can even multiply or sound different than my normal self (I’m not hearing voices but sometimes I can change my inner monologue to sound like Steve Harvey or something if that makes sense).  Sometimes like tv static can come up in my inner monologue too which freaks me out. 

I’m on anxiety meds that have helped for a couple of years but these past two weeks have been out of control. All I do is google OCD and psychosis symptoms and it gets me all frazzled. My therapist believes my compulsions are very much rooted in googling, and asking for reassurance.

95% of the time I am ok when I’m at work or around many people—doing things making my brain active—but the second I’m alone or about to go to bed, it’s spiraling and my thoughts are all encompassing. 

I’m also getting nightmares every night that can wake me up with even more anxiety. Please help, what’s happening. What is this? How do you fix it? I’m so scared.

67,"I've been working in this specific retail store for around 4-ish years now (first job and current one). I didn't know I had OCD up until 2 years ago and as I've been researching it more, it's helped me understand myself and specific patterns/compulsions I tend to repeat at work a lot better. A while back, I explained to my assistant manager that I figured out I have OCD and I did try to explain what it was and how it affected me without being too 'graphic' about it. Recently realized that since then, I've been put on a looot more organization/refilling tasks, which I don't mind too much but sometimes it's really overbearing and she typically only had me on pricing and cleaning. She doesn't seem to understand that I have a lot of self doubt and my false memory OCD affects me when counting things at work (even though I have explained that OCD is something with a lot of depth to it and have told her about things that stress me out in that regard) and it makes me take longer on the task than she wants me to be. I would try to explain more of this to her but.. She's kind of the person who just responds to everything with a mindset of ""if you're in physical pain, just drink tea, you'll be fine"" (not saying it's awful advice but it's sort of the only advice she gives lmao) and she's very ignorant about ND people too which I've tried to educate her on but she still chooses to be blissfully ignorant. I'm kind of looking for advice? Has anyone else working in retail had to deal with specific things like managers taking advantage of their employee having OCD? If so, how have you navigated it?

- (In regards to the ND ignorance part for a little more context, I've actively heard her infantalize, worship, and demean ND people all in one singular sentence and she's complained to me about how the special ed kids who come to work with us sometimes should be smart enough to fold the clothes they're given... as if they aren't literally disabled. She sort of refused to believe I had OCD when I first told her too because she just thought/thinks(?) it's solely a perfectionist and 'scared of germs' thing.)

75,"Hey, now I’m just gonna begin by saying, I’m not officially diagnosed with OCD but I’ve suffered with its symptoms since the summer of 2023, but here I’ll share some advice for those who are going through the roughest parts of OCD or experiencing its symptoms for the first time.

OCD is a mental health disorder that begins with intrusive thoughts about a subject in your life, from relationships to if you put some books back to the exact place you found them, OCD targets these subjects by causing doubt and making you worry to the point of having to check with people, go back and look, ask people for their thoughts, having to check yourself for signs or “proof” that these doubts would be correct. 
Now I’ve been in this subreddit before, same with TOCD,HOCD,POCD, and ROCD subreddits aside from reading countless articles online about them as I’ve suffered from their symptoms to the extreme, even now I still do.

What’s my advice though? Well, it’s to tell you that there is no winning with OCD, you won’t subdue these thoughts, but you won’t be beat either, OCD causes doubt and anxiety through intrusive thoughts making you question yourself so it surrounds itself with thoughts and a thought you’ll never get rid of, I mean you get thousands of em a day, so picking apart one out of thousands is pointless, what you need to do is to not show any reaction or though to these intrusive thoughts, once you get them, ignore them, don’t show any attention to them, it’ll only hurt you more.

Think of it all as a tie, you won’t get rid of OCD permanently but you can also make it so OCD can’t win either by showing it no attention, it won’t go away but once you begin to apply yourself to the procedure of not showing any attention to it at all, it’ll slowly stop making you panic, it’ll slow down, it won’t be gone entirely but it’ll slow down.

It’ll create many different thoughts, yes, but they all go away the same way any other thought would, by showing no attention and soon enough, you’ll forget it even happened.

I hope my advice helped in some way, it’s not over, it’s not done yet, you still got some fight in you just like I and hundreds of thousands did aswell, just push through and carry on with your day when it happens, good luck everybody. (This rule of thumb “Show it no attention” applies to every intrusive thought, no matter the type of OCD, and if you or someone you know is experiencing this or considering self harm and any other extreme measure of fixing this issue, please put you or someone else with some form of therapy and medication if it comes to it, it’s what helped me too👍”",OCD
76,"I have this tendency to ask unnecessarily specific questions to friends and family and if I don’t know the answer with certainty, then I feel very anxious. When I ask these questions and receive an answer, another question pops into my head and the cycle continues.

I have been trying to practice ERP to break the cycle by not asking the questions in my head when they arise because I know the cycle will just continue. But the questions just continually build up in my head and I ruminate over them and can’t focus on anything else.

How do I stop thinking about these unnecessarily specific questions?",OCD
77,"I’ve scheduled an appt to see my psychiatrist asap but wondering what meds everyone is on. I have adhd and depression/anxiety. Just realized I most likely have ROCD and I 100% have trich.

This last month I’ve noticed I’ve had a lot more anxiety and obsessive thoughts and relentless hair picking. Also had to evac from CA wildfires so that doesn’t help.

And I have this with friendships too where I’m genuinely afraid of this feeling and of the thoughts that will try to convince me my connection with other humans is illegitimate.

I don’t feel like this all the time and despite it, I maintain many close and intimate friendships. But 1-on-1 conversation is so scary to me, not because of run of the mill social anxiety. But instead it’s because I’m afraid that my relationships will be exposed to be illegitimate.

These are ego-dystonic thoughts that go against my desire for close, intimate relationships. My symptoms have been very manageable lately but sometimes it flares up to the point where I’m scared to be around other people.

This is such a niche theme and it sucks because it makes me feel lonely. So I was wanting to see if anyone else had it so I feel less lonely.

EDIT: Is there a name for “relationship” OCD that’s focused on platonic relationships? Because that’s what I struggle with (well, I also struggle with regular relationship OCD too, LOL).",OCD

87,"Its so bad nowadays.

In the past weeks ive been obsesively washing my hands or dezinfected my hands, workspace/gaming space, even my face with alcohol for cleaning. 

Ive been washing my hands and washing my face every time i think there is the slightest microbe that could be there.

A few days ago i slept on towels and used clean clothes as blankets. 

I usually cant eat/drink anymore after i deem theres a microbe in the food. 

Right now i just put a bowl with my favourite cereals. But to my nightmare, the bottle of milk that seemed full and new, had the lid open, with the little material on it as well that you need to peel away. My mind has me very stressed thinking somebody in the working field or a random cruel person from the store opened that bottle to intentionally put microbes or bad stuff in there.

Now, I have a big family with a lot of kids. Its probable they opened the bottle, even if to drink a little from it. But ig im stressed more bcs the bottle almost seems full of milk. And it makes me be more suspicious.

It doesnt help having physical symptons, like i ate one cereal from that bowl and i felt like my tongue and mouth were hurting/irritated/burning feeling (its probably because when I ate it also got from my lipstick that I put on, the lipstick being made intentionally spicy and it hurts when you apply it lol).

Now I have a delicious bowl of cereal and milk in front of me. But if i eat it now, id feel like a terrible person and stress extremely much, because what kind of cruel horrible ignorant person i would be if i ate it knowing it is contaminated? What terrible disgusting person would i be to get sick because of eating this cereal, and going to my partner and making them sick aswell with the bacteria from the contaminated milk?

This contamination OCD made me throw away my whole pen case and I need to throw away my lipsticks and dezinfect my bag extremely well (during exam time which is a speaking exam, the teachers made us wait in another room and put our bags and phones there while individually going to the exam room when its our turn. When it was my turn and i went to the exam room and left the other room where my classmates are, I think I heard them being mean and bad, saying they want to contaminate my lipsticks with std's, hearing them say my bag is a mess which would confirm they went trough my bag, because it is indeed a mess, and when i returned i saw my phone resting differently than i remember it, ever since that day i never put those lipsticks on again, i didnt even touch my bag much from that day and it was a week or two ago, and i even threw another lipstick that wasnt even in the bag, but i was scared when i saw a grey particle on it). 

And now im stressing more bcs my throat is warm and coughing and burning.

Like what is thisssssssssss

And as a reassurence, im waiting for your response, can I eat that bowl of cereal? Its not contaminated, right? Im out of my mind no? And Im not terrible person if i eat this bowl of cereal?",OCD

Hello, I have ocd and I obsess about my hair a lot. I recently got my hair done and two pieces on the top are a little yellow. This has been bothering me, so I made an appointment for a month after. I am now kinda getting used to it and liking it, but also I would like it to be more to my liking. I don’t know if I should go back to the salon, I am very nervous something will go wrong with it and I won’t like it more. If I do go to the appointment I am planning to show my hair stylist what I would liked tweaked. I know this is such a stupid thing to worry about, but I have ocd and little things like this really make me worry. I’ve been worrying about this all day I can’t stop. ",OCD

98,"I'll start with a bit about me. I'm a (F) teenager that has been diagnosed with ocd since the age of six. I have had a lot of ups and downs during this time, and I repeatedly find myself wondering if I actually have ocd and if it actually ""counts"" or if I'm just making everyone's life difficult for the sake of it. For me personally, my obsessive thoughts are my main issue, that being that I sometimes have breakdowns in school and at home and I'm very bad under stress. Most often it's as though my brain is latching on to a single thought and multiplying in until it completely takes over my consciousness. I often find myself obsessing over an interaction or occurrence multiple times and being unable to let go of a single conversation topic/disagree with anyone on any one subject. That being said I am incredibly extroverted and love being around people, so luckily this does hinder my social life in any way. My compulsions still play a part however. I have an issue with saying goodbye or goodnight to my parents without staring them in the eye and hearing every vowl and consonant of the word, after which I absolutely cannot see them, even out of the corner of my eye, or else it starts over. Another one that is particularly strong is my ""last time"" compulsion, which basically means that when I finish something ( I.e taking a bath, leaving a place, eating something ) I must nod in its direction and mutter ""last time"". This is funny to me because of course it's not the last time I'll be eating.... this was worse when I was younger as now it mostly affect things that aren't everyday like trips and exotic foods but it's still there and still affects me. I have been taking medication since August and it has been a tremendous help. I feel much calmer and more in control even if it is not a complete fix. Also very random but does it annoy anyone else (others with ocd) when people say stuff like ""wow the way you're organizing your pens is so ocd""? It's not ocd. It's not the same. I don't organize my pens or my room (my parents wish I did) and the condition is not simply liking things organized. ",OCD

Which subsequently is making me not be able to remember anything. I don’t even remember how I felt prior to all this except I know I was doing fairly well.

We've been waiting for the report and I just got it back and she talks about my ""symptoms"" and says I meet the diagnostic criteria for it and talks about the severity of it (mild-moderate). So does this mean I dont have ocd and she didnt diagnose me?

My parents would point out that it was strange but they overall didn’t complain much. My parents are both very old and we come from a country where mental illnesses are not discussed deepily so they have no idea what OCD even is. They just think I’m slightly paranoid and clean freak.
Anyways.. i never struggled with depression due to my OCD because i have lived my whole life with and got used to it. About a week ago, I had a massive panic attack over a breakup with my ex. My heart rate went up to 160/170. I started shaking soo badly and was about to pass out. My sibling helped me calm down by teaching me how to box breathe or take a few deep breaths to calm myself down. I eventually calmed down but then i realized that now i was manually breathing. I started being hyperaware of my breathing to a point where i was unable to go to sleep for days.

I have contamination OCD… mainly chemotherapy contamination causing cancer in me…

So, I’m a 34F… I’ve always wanted to be a doctor. Recently I had changed paths to PA bc it would allow more time with my family but my OCD… (which hasn’t been a problem till I was pregnant with my second child October of 2023…a few months before I had her) is making it really difficult. So I work as a derm medical assistant. A job I have done before & in my office we have 2 chemotherapy agents that are used from time to time. There are no safety precautions in place while using them like a designated place to use them, close transfer device, special place for discarding them. Nothing like that. They are small vials. They’re taken into the rooms by other MAs with no gloves on etc. So in my mind the whole office is contaminated with these drugs & me touching these surfaces will give me cancer. Now the problem is that I’m trying to find another job where they don’t use chemo at all but other jobs I’m looking up things that can cause cancer & im finding these things… like radiation or chemo etc in all these fields & it has really made me miserable. It’s making me not want to do healthcare which is what I always wanted. It’s also making me think these thoughts say I go on x field & I work with a cancer patient & am exposed to the chemo in their body. It’s taking over my life… idk. It’s changing me. I’m terrified. Idk what to do. Idk how you ERP with carcinogens. I’m at a loss.

Background info - watched mom suffer through 3 cancers… her illness & death gave me PTSD & on top of that I’ve already had a cancer. Mild cancer but still.

But everytime my friend is over at my house I'll say ""please give me him, bring him over the next time you come!!"" For months now, but everytime I say that my sister gets in the way and has a big stink about it and says ""no!! Don't bring him over! He's so ugly, just find another cat! We don't need him!""

But recently I was that my friend made a post about getting rid of all her cats prior, and he was on the first images out shining their other cats with his cute and goofiness♡ 
When I saw that post my heart sank!! I had a trouble panic attack and was sick to my stomach for days. (still am) when I mom got home I couldn't even tell her what I saw and couldn't tell her it was about him without crying, she told me just to text her if he was still at her house but I just couldn't! My anxiety was eating me alive, I was to scared to get a text back saying he was gone, my heart couldn't of taking it.

A few days later with no communication my friend drops by my house and while I'm outside my mom tells them about my break down and this cat and tells him that he's still at her house! I was do happy and relieved. I said please bring him over!! Just they was making jokes and saying I'll trade you him for your family cat! Which I can't do obviously. And I was like please I will pay you to give him to me! being  very serious about that statement. My friend and sister was joking and my sister said ""I'll pay you to not bring him over!"" And stuff like that :(

Then 2 days later they come by saying they got back news and says some is coming to get him and one of their other cats, I was so upset and sick I could have thrown up.. I beg her to let me have him, and then she hits me with ""sorry I just told them he was available!"" And then say ""you can't have him because life is unfair like that"" Like bruh, I want him first? And now that person is above me on the list to get him? T_T 

I was shaking the entire time and I couldn't hardly tell to them because was so upset, even though I tried masking it.

And for the last few days now I've been crying and praying hard that I can get him, I can just imagine with life with him would be like and it's just amazing!! I would be happier then any thing if I got him, he's so unique and cute! There's nothing like him!! He's just being himself and he's perfect that way! 

The thought of losing him and him going to the other person breaks my heart! I already miss him :(

And I know that he would be better of with someone else but me. But I'm to selfish to let him go.. the person that's getting him has another cat, they said that he would be an inside cat, but my Friend doesn't know this person and doesn't even know if their Reliable. 


And I was thinking like, why the crap am I so attracted to this cat that's now even mine?! I was for real thinking that I was a little autistic (i have for a while now before this point) I know I have OCD but could OCD make me get attached to things easily? I've experienced strong attachments all my life so this isn't nothing now, my mom has been trying to get rid of her goats but I all ways talk her out of it because I'm to attached to them, everything someone is getting rid of some things like an animal I'm always like ""no don't I'll regret it!"" Even when I'll be the one regretting it more then him and the said animal ain't even mine.. I'll even get attached to a fricking CAN if I'll allow my self to! 

I need help copping with not getting this cat, every time I had tried it had failed. Even if he's better off with the other person I still deeply want him! 

(My friend said that he is mean but I'm willing to work through that! I have this on cat who is a meany but I wouldn't trade her for the world! Same with him! It's getting summer so I'll be more active and I'll be able to spend more time with him if I get him :) 

I finally convinced my mom to let me him him but it's my friend that I need to convince, they just joke about said thing and doesn't listening when im being real about something. I feel like they are just ignoring me and waiting as the days pass til that person picks him up. they have done this in the past to me, and it doesn't make me feel it great.

 They're every wishy washy and will give their animals to anyone but you, even if you want them/been taking care of them
(They did the same thing with horses (i also got supper attached to them) that's on our property and we have been talking care of them for free and they decided to sell them. We were last pick above everyone else)

I've been Really stressed recently and this is the mega kicker!

Almost everything I've had interest in in the past has been infected. I'm miserable. I over the past few years have learned more about people that I've talked to and it made it so much worse than it used to be. My relationships used to only last a year (due to BPD things but that's besides the point) but my last one lasted two and I didnt realize that it would make this issue this much worse.

Hey everyone,

I’m struggling with some intense OCD-related rumination, and it’s been really tough. I need some support and to share what I’ve been going through.

A while ago, I briefly dated a guy. We never had sex, but I emotionally attached to him deeply because of how he made me feel. It took me a year to get over him, and I’ve worked through depression and therapy to move on. I didn’t know he was into trans women, and I confided in my cousin, who is a pretty trans woman, about him. I even cried and talked to her about how much I was struggling. I gave her his social media to see if she could find clues I missed.

Here’s where things get complicated: I now have this overwhelming feeling that she is secretly connected to him. Her energy changed, and I can’t stop ruminating over it. I’ve driven myself crazy trying to find answers, even asking her if she’s talking to him. Every time she says, “I wouldn’t do that to you,” I don’t fully believe her, and it feels so calculated. I did find some clues but not concrete proof 

This situation sent me into a psychotic episode, and I ended up being hospitalized because I couldn’t cope with the uncertainty and my inability to trust her. I feel this unbearable pain because I went through so much to get over him, and I just can’t let go of the emotion of the potential betrayal.

I’m feeling really hopeless and even contemplating long-term inpatient care because I can’t get past these overwhelming feelings. I’m not asking for judgment, but just some understanding and support. Please know that hearing things like “let them be together” or “move on” is really triggering for me right now because I already know that. I just need to be heard and not feel invalidated.",OCD

I’ve been losing it! I have 4 hobbies I really love. Mountain biking, snowboarding, onewheeling, and skateboarding. I go through these insanely obsessive episodes with each hobby. With snowboarding, I’m constantly trying to find the perfect kit. On marketplace, offer up, Depop, mercari, and browsing google looking for specific spec and deals. I do the same shit with my other hobbies. I’ll buy something brand new maybe not like something small like a zipper on the jacket. Return and by a different till I’ve gone through 3 or 4. I’m on my phone all day doing this shit. I’ll delete all this apps then be on them through a web browser. I feel like I can’t stop. I’ve been spending so much money on stuff I do t need.

132,"Hello! 
I (29 M) was formally diagnosed with OCD in 2009 when I was 14. When I was 19, by pure chance, I was able to see one of the leading therapists on OCD in the country. Located in metro Atlanta, Dr. Josh Spitalnick. 

I wanted to share something I think every single of of you should have access to. I've googled it 100 different ways and it's never come up. 

He taught me something called ""The Whethers and Maybes"" and it goes like this. 
Take your current obsession. 

-Example, ""I am a murderer"" or ""I am going to kidnap that person"" 

You say this either out loud or to yourself and use this script exactly. 

""Whether or not (insert intrusive thought) I can only control my actions and intentions 

""Maybe I (insert inintrusive thought) maybe I'm not (insert intrusive thought) I can only control my actions and intensions"" 

If this can help even 1 person today, I'll chalk that one up as a win! ",OCD
133,"A month ago or so I saw a post here where people discussed feeling certain that they will die soon.

Two years ago, I started experiencing an intense inner turmoil and also started having special dreams, some of which I interpreted as my time in hell.

I really felt like I had limited time. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, in the midst of all this, a pedestrian I've never seen before in my tiny town randomly signs me a ""2"" with her fingers when I'm sitting in traffic. Immediately I interpret this as ""two weeks left"" which turned to two months, and then settled to two years.

That time is very soon now. I think that happened about mid february to the beginning of march two years ago and although I haven't thought of it much lately, I just had a very unsettling dream.

I dreamt I took a bus full of people into town, but the town was blocked off due to a festival. Right before you get to town, there is a big cemetary. The bus driver veered off towards it. The bus was no longer full, but instead there was only me, one more person and the driver. He stopped the bus near the cemetary and opened the doors. I asked ""is this the end station?"" to which I think he replied something more complex, but which amounted to a ""yes"".
I got off and started walking towards the cemetary - though I didn't think of that in my dream (I think I thought I was walking towards the ""festival""). Strangely enough, the entire town - everywhere was empty except for me, and the bus with the driver and the second passenger.
My body was stiff and I was walking awkwardly, and the passenger shouted at me asking either if something had happened or if I needed help. I replied ""I'm just stiff. Getting old."" in a joking manner, as I made my way towards the cemetary.

The dream had no elements of anxiety or darkness or discomfort, but was rather calm and kind of ""serene"". It was a bright summers day.

Only upon waking up did I think about the fact that I was old, alone, and walking towards my grave. I feel very freaked out. My dreams really do tend to have *a lot* of meaning, especially when it comes to death.

Can anyone relate to having a dream like this?",OCD
134,"Bullies aren't typically educated, well informed, or even just bright.. They're like predators, parasites. Your ocd says there's a problem?? No there's not! I mean, maybe there is. Maybe there could be..*sarcastic oh no, faints on cue lol* So, ocd's looking for a fight. It's a new day, perfect for creating new habits. Perfect for breaking the cycle. Are you going to go and do what the BULLY wants you to do today?? Don't take the bully's advice.. Never take the bully's advice!! You think it's actually trying to HELP YOU?!!!! No, the bully wants you to keep coming back into the woods with it. Don't. And don't take the extra long road either, where you try to beat the Bully by playing IT'S GAME. Trying to prove it's wrong..

Nope. We're gonna FIGHT. But, we're gonna fight the RIGHT way. The way that freaking stuns the BULLY. Shocks it, maybe even leaves it SPEECHLESS if we're feeling up to it. Oh Yes..First, we'll start by tuning it out. You have to go back into the woods for this, maybe you're already there. So you focus on doing whatever you're doing, whether that's building a fire or playing a game of tossing stones into the water. Let ocd try to get your attention. Let it talk. Your job is get better and better at ignoring it and going back to doing whatever it is that you're doing or trying to do. Mistakes happen. You're not trying to be perfect here, you're just trying to do your best. Maybe you shout back a couple times, that's okay.. 

When you start to feel like you've got a good handle at this, or maybe that wasn't a great starting point for you.. Try taunting the bully. Let the bully talk, it's always going to right. But YOU, this time you don't care...Let ocd say it's shannigans. Your RESPONSE? Meh..""yea, yea..whatever. I mean maybe.."" Lose Interest. SHOW NO INTEREST...OOOOU BULLIES HATE THIS!!!! How dare you 🤭🤭🤭 you naughty, naughty person you Lol. 

And maybe it's been a few weeks or even a month or two, maybe you're feeling very comfortable and much more confident. Like you're genuinely ready for something else.. Now, let's have some fun for a CHANGE!! We're gonna sneak into the woods..we see ocd laying there alone all sad and depressed. And we are going to sneak over to where it is and get it all riled up!! Us! Bothering the bully for a change!! Touch that stick, leave the lights on, don't check the door..DO THAT TINY THING THAT YOU KNOW IS GUARANTEED TO PISS IT OFF!!! And then MAKE IT EVEN MORE MAD!!! Don't take it's Advice!!! It's not real..It's advice is just more GARBAGE. No compulsions.

You want to start small. Start slow and steady. And really only move on to something harder when you're actually bord of the step you're on..Find Anti-ruminative hobbies or interests that help distract you and engage you. Listen to Yourself and go at your own pace, do NOT rush. I can't emphasize that enough.. I'm also not a licensed therapist but this is essentially the basics of ERP therapy put in my own words of course.. In a nutshell, don't listen to the Bully or play it's game or follow IT'S RULES!! Hope this encourages or helps someone. ",OCD
135,"I struggle with OCD and social anxiety. In most social settings, it doesn’t take a very observant person to notice this. 

I fear that due to my outward expression of anxiety (which I am working to resolve) people will sometimes take advantage of this. Despite being aware that things are done specifically to evoke fear, I still enter an obsessive cycle about it. 

Ex: Coworker is swamped with work. I happen to have a free moment. This is a luck of the draw situation and is not typical weekly. We receive a company wide notice that productivity is down and should be higher. 

Coworker says I need to take over her next client or else my boss might sit me down and fire me over lack of productivity. She’s doing this to be “kind”. Despite knowing she just wants me to take over her work, I begin to obsess over losing my job. I spend hours googling next steps for if this happens when I go home. I ruminate for days.

that being said: compulsive behavior in reaction to heightened anxiety is something that i have always struggled with and it is becoming more of a hindrance in my day-to-day life. a lot of it is a mixture of job and current event anxiety-- it's good to be informed but i find myself losing entire chunks of my day to compulsively googling the same things over and over again.

144,"Formally diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, self identified leaning towards ASD now that other aspects of my mental health are being treated. 

Looking for insight from others who struggle with ruminating and identifying and feeling emotions instead of intellectualizing them. 

For context, I am currently in CBT with an ERP focus for OCD - we are working through perfectionism, all or nothing, just right feeling and needing to know all the information. To note, we are in the early stages of ERP, so a ton more work to do. This is a message I sent to my therapist this morning, curious if others have insight or suggestions to share bc I am STRUGGLING.

""Ok I know we are easing into the more intense ERPs.. but I do really struggle with the how long to feel emotions and what to do with that vs. Intellectualizing them and not feeling them bc feeling them doesn't resolve the problem and it's better to stay rational and work through it. 

For easier things like, clean only my dishes not the sink full (I have actually been doing this for months now) - it's annoying and I hate how dirty my house is, but I made the decision to refuse to waste what little free time/energy I have on cleaning up after the other grown ass people in my house. Which then results in me just avoiding the kitchen and/or kitchen sink as much as possible to just not feel overwhelmed or pushed to clean up after everyone. Which has worked, but does negatively impact my life in that if I'm avoiding the kitchen as to not be irrated about the mess then I'm avoiding cooking bc it's overwhelming and then I'm not eating the best I can. (Increased processed food and take out). Which lol maybe we add cooking in a disgusting chaotic kitchen as an erp, give that a 75 on the suds.

For things that are more significant, persay, such as issues with my husband or Thomas potentially using - things that are far more out of my control (i.e. peoples behavior and free will)... I have tried to, like you said, just stop. Telling myself spiraling is not going to change the situation, no matter how many angles I attack it from I cannot make them do the things that they should or behave how I want, so wasting time and energy ruminating is not productive and will not change things. So I feel the feelings, angry, disappointed, frustrated, overwhelmed, alone, distraught, helpless, etc. (almost cry). Breathe and come up with a plan and try to shut the thoughts off. But then it's like my mind needs something to think about to not go back to the original issue. So now I'm battling the spiral by replacing it with another topic.. whether it's my other brother jimmy(he got into a car accident last week, he is ok but it was my car so he's beating himself up over it and I'm trying to reiterate that I'm not mad and.. hear me out pot calling the kettle black here.. spiralling and beating himself up about it won't change what happened and will only hold him back), or husband issues bc it's easy to fall back on feeling stuck and alone, or of course there's work and the one million things I can think about and plan for or whatever... The list goes on. 

I guess how do I work on stopping the search for replacing one issue to spiral on with another.. it's like the babyshower thing I mentioned in session.. as long as my brain feels like it's being productive it soothes me. I feel like at some point in my life I was like welp, this bad boy never turns off... So if I keep it in productive, problem solving mode instead of all the other bullshit it can do and dissolve into, I'll be ok... Bc at least I'm staying rational and productive and not being emotional and trapped in my head helpless. Queue cptsd for being the eldest child who never had a safe place to feel and share emotions and had to be the barrier between the parents and the children so they both separately had a safe place for emotions (aka me). 

How do I rework that? Is it just me making the safe place for myself to feel and to not 'do'? Not always be the problem solver?

Then what? I just feel all those feelings while living my life normally? Here let me fold my laundry while I rage cry? How do you feel the feeling without ruminating about them? Do I just wallow in bed until I stop feeling? 

Anyway, no need to respond.. but figured this might help bc I seem to struggle to articulate this ""in person"" well.""",OCD

146,"I finally got in to see a psychiatrist yesterday and got a high dosage of venlafaxine for OCD & depression, as well as trazadone for a sleep aid (stops thoughts), to which I am very excited for because I’ve been bed ridden for months now. Months ago my symptoms were different (excessive cleaning, checking, obsessions, intrusive thoughts) but have lately just been obsessive and ruminative thought patterns / intrusive thoughts. I know my medication is supposed to help with this, but it’s not like that will just ‘cure’ my OCD. I am worried about immense stress levels returning at some point and triggering another bad OCD episode for me. I was just given medications and kinda told to figure it out myself from here, as it was emergency psychiatry intake. In Canada the wait times are about a year for regular psychiatry. 

So, I’m not really sure where to go now. If the medication fixes my symptoms that’s great, but what do I need to look out for and avoid doing as part of my recovery? Is medication something I should be on for life? I’ve read the reassurance seeking and obsessive thought patterns are all part of it, but that has been part of me for so long that I don’t know how to just not do that.

147,"Hi all,

I've been struggling with OCD for 6 years now, but I can safely say I've never had harm OCD until today.  
I think it's also moral OCD (that I have had many times) mixing with stuff, but since I have never had anything like this before I thought I'd ask for advice, so here's the TLDR:

I have very strong morals (sometimes too strong) and I find it very hard if loved ones have different opinions on things I find very important.  
I happen to also fixate on environmentalism and stopping climate change and I feel like a bad person if I don't do everything I can to be as green as possible.  
This led to me kinda freaking out upon finding out that a lot of my loved ones are doing something that is bad for the environment. I've already told them, they have their own opinions on it, they're gonna continue doing it, it should be fine. Not everyone has to be a perfect environmentalist.

But my OCD is now telling me 'you want to hurt them for doing that' and 'they're going to get hurt because they're doing that' and I think it's the first time I've experienced something alike to harm OCD.

Does anyone else struggle with similar things? What helps you?

I’m in my mid 20’s and had quite a bad life overall. Divorced parents, abusive mother, bullied, years of isolation, many stays in mental hospitals. 

I specifically struggled the most with contamination OCD.

I’ve moved into my first apartment last october and was enrolled in a job agency course. I was focusing on that but it ended in november and the job agency has denied me to continue the 2nd part of the course because i am the disabled welfare category and not in the unemployed category. 

Since i think education is important to me i continued struggling like hell to overturn the decision. After some time i was the only one left believing that the decision could be overturned.
It was rough to keep going but i have found an organization that has filed a lawsuit on my behalf since i can’t afford a lawyer. 

Last year was also tough in some regards, i was grieving the breakup with my girlfriend, had a friendship end and some other things like having to move in back with my mom for a month.

Since i haven’t found new friends yet and i’m just not able to go to a place and have anxiety about joining a sport i have been pretty much very isolated yet again for 3 months.

For the past few days i have had alot of traumatic thoughts and emotions leaving me in a terrible emotional state since they won’t stop. 

However it’s really not that bad. It does feel like hell no doubt but I’ve felt worse before. The one thing that i am very uncomfortable with is that i am actually doing great when it comes to functioning. I started a sort of schedule/check list and it helps me build discipline. 

So idk i am really unable to stop feeling a shit ton of terrible emotions but now i see that it is normal for ocd to ruminate.

So afterall it’s not as bad as i thought. 

I hope i can meet a friend soon i know it’s going to help. 

If you are struggling right now this could maybe help you a bit to put things into perspective. You will be in a better place if you get with people. Your current concerns will be in the past at some point and you will forget about them.

To me in the past suffering has helped a lot to reset my mind. Not every time but when suffering is really bad it forces you to understand really deeply.

You are not alone. You are just alone right now. 

You will have to build a full life and remembering what you don’t want brings clarity.

I know that mental health is manageable in the right circumstances that’s where i’m going to go again. This sort of low point it’s just that. It’s understandable that my mental health has collapsed. 

I will have a few more days of this shit no matter how much i have to cry in agony.

149,"i have a hard time shortening my shower time. i feel like im never ""clean enough"", even though i dont necessarily have a fear of getting sick. its more of a fear of staying dirty and being unhygienic. i feel like if i shorten my shower time, i wont wash myself as throughly so i will stay dirty and it will ""build up"" over time. but i cant keep this up anymore. my showers are more than an hour long and im wasting too much water and time. do you have any advice?",OCD
150,"I’ve learned quite a few about OCD recently and have been doing a lot of research. For years, I could not understand what was wrong with me. I went to therapy, was always in a constant state of searching and figuring things out. Now I’m realizing that I might been struggling with OCD or at least some symptoms of it- this WHOLE time. 

My most paralyzing thought at the moment is deciding my career path. My two most common thoughts when deciding:
- What if I end making the wrong decision and end up living a miserable life due to this decision?
- What if I’m choosing the wrong career and the right choice was actually in front of me this whole time?

I’ve always admired people who knew what they wanted to be since they were children. I always thought of so many possibilities. I had different interests and loved anything interesting. Now, I’m left undecided. Every time I research a career I might like, I end up doubting myself, rethinking everything, and starting a whole new search all over again. I’ve changed my mind so many times that Im embarrassed . The cycle goes as follows: I find something interesting, I get very excited, I research more and more. Then the excitement fades and I start having doubts, ‘Do i really think I’ll be happy doing this?’, then I no longer like it. I also have to add that if I move on to another option, I start obsessing over the fact that my last option could be the right one that I let go of. I end up mentally exhausted and stop thinking about it all together. 

How can I overcome this? What can I rely on to make such a decision? My brain is not reliable at the moment. I really want to progress with my professional life. I wish someone would decide for me lol.

151,"TL;DR: I'm starting on medication for severe anxiety and OCD after dealing with it for around 15 years - and I'm scared.

Sooo - I've dealt with severe anxiety and OCD (currently very contamination based, at least that's the most debilitating part of it) and have mainly gone to therapy or dealt with it myself. It's been back and forth and now at 25, it's like everything in me just decided thatci just can't do it anymore - I'm not gonna fix this myself.

I've been to the doctor and a psychiatrist and been told to start medication. I've never been told this before and so I've build up this feeling and mentality that meds were NOT for me and that I COULD fix this on my own. 

And now I can't. I'm so bound to my apartment and can't be or go anywhere. I'm soo fuckinf close to dropping out of my beloved education (filmschool, so I'll likely never got accepted in again since that proces is tough) and I feel like I've isolated from everyone I know. I can't do this anymore. I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of me. And honestly, a part of me can't wait to get some medication - yet it still makes me want to piss my pants...

I'm mainly scared of two things;
1) side effects.
2) that it just doesn't work - because then what?

My brother has tried different meds for both depression, anxiety and OCD and had some pretty bad side effects, that basically is the root cause of how my anxiety started. I'm scared that I'll react like him but I'm also scared of feeling empty inside. My brain is chaotic - which right now is a mess for me - but usually that's one of my strengths as a creative. But I'm scared that it'll make me so empty that I can't even be that anymore.

And then if it doesn't work - then what? Then I'll have nothing else to help me and that scares me.

I guess I'm just ranting but also looking to bear other people's experiences. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna take 'setralin' - have anyone tried that and how did it help or affect you?",OCD
152,"Hi guys, just curious with the question in the title. I've had 2 appointments with a psychologist so far with about a 2-3 month separation in between them. I'm being charged about 300 AUD or 150 USD and he said it would take several years which is baffling since that would equate to a couple thousand dollars for 1 hour every few months. School's starting in a few days for me and I really don't want to go through my last 2 years of school without treatment for anything I might have. What's your guys' experience? Thanks :)",OCD
153,"Are these intrusive feelings? 
for example, waking up and habing a feeling of not wanting to live in a world like this oe not ""liking the world i live in"" and this makes me extremely anxious that i feel this way?

I also have su*cidal ocd. Im just curious how to approach this feeling, should i label it as ocd or listen to it more?",OCD
154,"And I'm doing really well :) 

I'm happy in life, probably even more overall than I was 13+ months ago. Lots of new good things have happened. Most old good things are still around & just as enjoyable. I've laughed with my friends just as hard, I've had amazing food, I've created art, loved my job, and made enjoyable memories. I will keep doing so. 

The big change is still here and it's here to stay, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It turned out okay, pretty good even. I've gotten used to the bad parts. When they still cause problems, it's more of an annoyance than an end of the world. 

I hope this sheds some hope on folks. Your worst-case-scenario is always worse in your head than it would be irl. 

We have to live with a lot of horrible ""if""s, and it can feel like a teeter-totter where one side is ""everything's fine"" and the other is ""total destruction of all happiness."" But that's not how the world works. There's happiness to be had on both sides. 

I'm not going to answer questions about what my fear was that came true, bc I want this to be a general message of positivity & hope, not one that might get mistaken for only applying to my specific situation. 

You'll be ok - not because your fears are impossible or never going to come true, but because life goes on anyway. ",OCD
155,"Also a few other questions
I live in Cali, if you have Partnership health insurance was TMS covered while going to therapy? (I use nocd and love it and yes the billing department has gotten better.)
If it did help, how so?
Were you medicated or not during the  treatment period or did you have to wean off before starting TMS? I’m asking bc maybe interactions between tms and the brain may be helpful or strained with medication use (meds for depression/anxiety.) 
If it didn’t help, why not? ",OCD
156,"For context, I’m not looking for any diagnosis. I already know I have OCD. I just need to know if this is OCD related. 

So, I have harm OCD. But my perfectionism doesn’t feel linked to that at all. However, my perfectionism is…. Time consuming and detrimental to my mental health to say the least. I have to constantly rearrange things, check over things, redo things entirely purely bc they’re not sufficient. Other people say they’re great or that I need to stop thinking so much about it but I don’t know how to do that. Even this post I’ve spent 32 minutes editing so far to try to sound kind, well-spoken and not offensive to anyone. I’ve been in therapy for years and no therapist has been able to help me overcome perfectionism. I feel like if I even try to not be perfectionistic my whole world will literally burn to the ground and I’ll be in a psych ward. I’ll lose my job, my family, everything. The only reason I’ve made it this far is because I hold myself to such high standards. But the standards keep getting higher and I can’t keep up. 


I don’t know how to live without being a perfectionist. I know that sounds dramatic but I’m being genuine. I’ve tried but it makes me too anxious and hysterical. 

Is there hope for me? Could an OCD specialist help? My current therapist doesn’t treat OCD or specialize in it so she suggested a specialist for perfectionism might help but I don’t even know how to find that. I saw there’s perfectionism OCD as a subtype but I don’t even know if this is OCD or not. I just feel so… tired and burned out all the time. 

I’m exhausted, you guys. 

Basically, do you think a specialist in OCD would help? Or are there any other methods you’ve tried? I’ll take any advice I can get.

169,"Im between needing support and advice and also wanting to vent just to get this off of my mind.

So I have been suffering with harm OCD however mostly it's been with suicidal thoughts. Oddly enough I can usually get past those thoughts on my own. But my harm OCD manifested itself in a new way to me just last week.

About a week ago i had a dream about harming a family member. It messed me up in the head because the day before, me and this particular family member got into a verbal fight. It sent me into a spiral. ""Did i really dream that???"" Anyways I had a mini panic attack in my bed and then decided to go about my day.

Furthermore the anger i felt with my particular family member scared me even more. I was angry with them and having these scary thoughts. Even though we fought I don't want to do anything like harm them???? So my brain was confused and kept telling me ""see you are angry so you must want to hurt them"" and it sent me into a spiral.

The thoughts of ""what if I harm them"" persisted all day. I kept trying to shove my thoughts and suppress them because I was so scared I would do what happened in my dream. Surely I was going insane right? My mind kept telling me I was a monster.

Well so I'm dealing with this for a couple of days and eventually the anxiety of the thought starts to go away. Now I'm having the intrusive thought without the anxiety bc its nothing new at this point. I then realized that I had that intrusive thought but didn't feel any worry. It sent me into another spiral...

""How could I have this thought and not have anxiety attached to it!?!?"" 

Anyways I decided to face my fear and Google what was going on.  Upon reading I learned about Harm OCD. I have been diagnosed OCD my whole life but again. Very recently has it manifested itself in harm. Which scared me out of nowhere.

Upon researching my harm OCD I discovered this YouTube account that I really liked called ""OCD and Anxiety"" where this man talks about harm ocd. It helped me cope ALOT. As he was explaining I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.

Then came the next day and I kept watching the video everything the intrusive thought came back. And again. And again. And again.

Until I realized that I was using these videos as a compulsion to feel better with this harm intrusive thought.

As I kept watching he explains that the best way to get rid of an intrusive thought is to simply accept it.

The thought of excepting what I did in my dream and having these thoughts scare me. I can't accept it. And I'm starting to feel better, but I just still feel shame and guilt.

I think I have always had OCD - but never really consumed me. Maybe just obsessing over worst case scenarios. Double checking appliances and doors, of fear of a break in or fire. 

However, it is starting to consume my life. I have experienced several traumatic events the past nine months - a major health scare, doctors say I am fine, but I do not believe them. My grandma (who I was very close with) passed away in December. Additionally my son has a connective tissue genetic disorder. 

So here’s the thing - for the past month or so I am catastrophing EVERYTHING. A few examples: recently there was a deadly traffic accident on the hwy that is the most convenient and fastest way into town. I am terrified now, and do everything I can to avoid. Either just not going into town or taking alternative routes that add 20-30 minutes onto my drive. Found out my son has to have a dental procedure, under general anesthesia- because of his heart condition this needs to be done in a hospital. I am terrified and can’t even look at him without feeling this impending doom. Last week, I was convinced my husband was going to leave me (he has never, ever given an indication). 

I guess I am asking if anyone has just had it set on so quickly like this. I have an appointment with my therapist and psychiatrist next week. But I feel like I am losing my mind, and I am just letting my life slip away because all I do is worry about the future. ",OCD

But no, there was a moment when I panicked about the idea of going blind, and that was what caused my first symptoms and all the others that came along.

So my question is, what are others things that OCD can trigger? Im sure that VSS is not the only thing that OCD can trigger, and if I would know early that my OCD could cause me something like VSS I would massively chill out a lot, so I would really like to know before anything bad happens

every day i get the images over and over again of my mom or grandma or aunt or sister hanging themselves or overdosing in the most disturbing haunting ways. it doesnt go away. the more i try to make it go away it gets more twisted. i hate it so much because i love my family so much. i have to know how they feel 24/7 or ill go insane. i have to check on my mom or my sister and if they dont let me in on how they are feeling ill go crazy. i need to know they wont kill themselves. it probably bothers them how emotional i get but i cant help it i dont know how to stop it.

growing up when me and my sister used to sleep in the same room i couldn’t sleep for hours sometimes because everytime my sister had a pause in her breathing, my brain would tell me to get up and check her pulse to make sure she’s alive. and if i didnt id find her dead in the morning.

Ive had this really sticky intrusive thought, it’s incredibly distressing and my whole entire body reacts to it like i absolutely need to do this awful thing. Ive been crying for an hour and ive only told my one friend because i didnt know who else to tell, i cant tell my parents as the thought targets them. I feel mentally paralyzed and like intrusive thoughts completely take over, make it feel like i cant resist anything. Ive had this same intrusive thought since December, im working on just letting it be and not reacting or reassurance seeking. That works for a little but then i get the terrible urge again. Things feel hazy and i have to fight to get control once again. Im scared. Very scared. Idk how to help myself at home besides crying and shutting myself in my room.

fall asleep, i was feeling dizzy for a while and thought it’d help me to sleep but it didnt. from 11pm-8am i couldnt sleep at all. i didnt get ANY sleep and my legs were hurting too, i kept getting obsessive thoughts and also yesterday, i had the craziest panic attack of my life. idk whether i should call it a panic attack or an ocd attack but i drank 2 cups of coffee(ik bad decision cuz coffee triggers my ocd) and i thought everything would be alright. but i rushed to the doctor because it got so bad and i was crying and out of breathe the whole time, is this why the melatonin didnt work??

193,"I had seen my boyfriend's aunt's Facebook for the first time and there were several of his cute children there, lots of them, then there was a photo of him with his family at the mall and I had the thought that I thought the family was ""poor"" but that's not true, I had that thought a while ago and I already had OCD.

Before I knew I had OCD (before I saw the photo), my mind was telling me that my boyfriend had a better house than me, and his living conditions too. So, in my head, everything was different in his family, something different from mine. Before I went to his house, I imagined that his house would be better than mine because he lives on a street with only nice houses, and so I imagined that his house was almost like a mansion. I thought everything was different from mine... So, when I went to his house, I was completely wrong. It was just like mine, normal and simple. So, when I looked at his photo from 2015 at the mall, it was a normal, simple family, just like mine, without all that expensive clothing. So, I'm still a little impressed by how his life experience is the same as mine. I feel guilty for having had that thought, as if I were judging the way they were dressed, maybe because I imagined it differently, and then when I see something that my family also wears, I'm ""shocked."" It gave me a feeling of judgment. even more so because I didn't refute the thought, and so it seems like I judged in some way, I don't know how to explain to you how the thought went, but it was a thought that they were too simple at the mall, or that the clothes were very out of place for the occasion, maybe I imagined it was something ""rich"" or whatever.",OCD

199,"This is something that I felt very alone in but something that more recently as my diagnohas come back to the forefront of my mind again, And I've realized that it was running my life a lot more than I thought it was, Something I used to experience a lot more in my relationships, and in response to enough stimuli overwhelm (a boyfriend yelling and berating me and I try to get them to stop but they won't, my father saying he's going to hurt himself, etc) for me they both relate to being a bad person, but Basically they consist of me totally losing ability to be in the normal world, I end up in the fetal position plugging my ears. And I usually end up repeating something like I can't do this 200 times in a soft voice, Or something of the sort and it's almost like I'm drooling and I'm in the space of what feels like almost peace in the chaos. If like it takes me to another place but it always has repetition in it, I can't talk I can't think clearly, I'm just in the state where I am totally deabilitated. Now if the person goes away or if they support me in a loving way it seems to go away. It seems like it's in relation to feeling a connection break or somebody not listening to me. It's like I can't physically handle it and so it turns into what I've seen some people call cptsd attack.  Because of the repetition though to me I was wondering if it was actually related OCD.

It’s like I forget how to swallow properly and I hyper focus on what it’s like to swallow. I think it’s coming back for me for the first time since starting meds.

214,"I have found myself in an insanely confusing and tragicomical situation with my therapist where I believe she has a false memory, but instead I'm anxious and doubting myself.

So I've been in short term therapy for OCD with a therapist who I don't really like but the whole thing is almost over and I couldn't be bothered to switch her (it would've been a huge hassle in my situation anyway). She has been somewhat helpful I guess but medication and my own work with myself have done way more for me. For context I suffer more with a pure O type thing.

But right now I feel like she has lost the plot. So I just had my first session with her since the holidays right.. and before it she texted me to bring back a book she borrowed me. And instantly I was like...

.......what book??

During the session she insisted she has borrowed me a book about OCD and she has given 0 chance to the thought of not giving it to me. When I haven't had for a second a single memory of this book.

Yes I have ADHD which she knows about. I lose and forget things. But I also have autism and a vivid photographic type memory. Even if i lose objects I don't forget they EXIST. I can remember what my classmates wore in 2010 for Pete's sake.

I googled what this book looks like, didn't ring any bells. It just has such a cliche school/sience book cover it has made me question my own memories along with my therapist's firm opinion about borrowing me this book.

I have checked my bags, my bookshelf, any sensible place it could be in. I have my next session in 3 weeks and I gotta find this seemingly nonexistent book before then or I'm gonna lose it if she still keeps at it. This whole thing has caused me to ruminate endlessly about the book and how to magically remember it. I can barely focus on anything else.

Has anyone else had something similar happen?? Idk how to even describe this it's so weird.. like a false memory caused by a false memory? But maybe I'm wrong and it isn't false at all? Ugh",OCD
215,"I feel like I haven’t been able to fully experience my 6.5 months of pregnancy because the whole time I am telling myself it will all be ok once she is born and I see her.

I’ve managed to almost completely stop my locking/checking/filming compulsions but it’s manifesting in other ways now. 

Thinking that my partner is not the father of the baby even though I have no reason to believe otherwise. I have spoken to him about this multiple times and he always is understanding and reassuring but I know I can’t keep doing this because it feeds the OCD. 

Early in the pregnancy I had a false positive result for HIV, multiple tests following and back negative clear, all good. Again I have spoken to him about this and he was supportive the whole time. Even after the negative results have come back I still sometimes think I could have it and spiral.

Deep down I know that these things aren’t real but the fact that they have ever been a thought in my mind makes me wonder why and I get stuck in a spiral again. It’s not something that I am having anxiety attacks about, it’s just the annoyance of the presence of the thought. I want to enjoy the next 3.5 months, be excited about a baby shower, be excited for what’s ahead. 

I don’t know if it’s possible that because of big life changes happening, the false positive result, being pregnant, having a baby, buying our first home has me feeling like this. I’m worried for after I give birth and how I am going to mentally cope.

I don’t know what I’m looking for I guess this is advice from other people who are or have been pregnant or if I am just trying to find reassurance in a round about way ",OCD

226,"First of all I really don't know where I'm going with this post. I suppose I just want to get my experiences off my chest and mention my themes. And speak to fellow sufferers as I've not only just figured out I may have OCD but I've also never shared my experiences with fellow OCDers. I'd also like to hear any similar stories.

My entire life I just labelled myself as a ""worrier"" or a ""weirdo"" and to put it into context I have only just spoke to someone for the first time about my thoughts and feelings a matter of months ago so this is all extremely fresh for me.

I suppose my first theme must have been as a kid I'd always put my hand over my heart to make sure it was still beating as I'd have this extreme fear of my heart just suddenly stopping. My second theme was in high school doing exams I had an intrusive thought that I'd written an extremely offensive sentence in my exam and this was mental torture as I wanted to go back and check I didn't write it but I couldn't. These are my earliest memories of what I can now label as OCD.

Over the years I've always had extreme anxiety of sleep. Which was my next theme. If I had something to do the next day I'd get it into my head that I needed a good amount of sleep and because this created anxiety it's all I would think about and it would result in a sleepless night.

Over the years I'd say it hasn't always been doom and gloom because I couldn't label it as I didn't have a clue any of these themes were OCD. I'd just get on with life and I could even go years without any serious OCD issues. I've always seemed to have had an obsession over my appearance though and the way my clothes fit.

Over the past year I've been having severe intrusive dark thoughts and false memories which pushed me to speak to a doctor and to speak with close ones. This wasn't easy for me to do as you all know its weird and disturbing in our own minds so god only knows how it may seem to others.

I feel grateful to know I'm not alone out there and I'm not a weirdo I just have a mental health issue. Reading posts on this sub reddit has given me extreme comfort as I've never been able to relate with a bunch of people as much in my life. But I also feel like I could have got help sooner if I understood OCD. All we're ever told is that it's to do with cleanliness and having things in order so educating others on OCD is also a big goal of mine.

obviously, im not invalidating people with that kind of OCD, but im pretty sure that the acquaintance is faking it (they have a history of faking disorders as well). i feel kind of... invalidated? i don't know if it's the OCD making me think they're faking it, or whether it's that they seemed as if they WANTED to have OCD because it's a ""cute little disorder""

232,"I've always been a ""germaphobe"" isolating as much as possible when someone in the house gets sick, washing my hands frequently, lots of hand sanitizer, etcetera, but for the last year, over a year, it's been in absolute overdrive. I don't understand it, it feels like since about November 2023, the amount of germs and sickness has skyrocketed. I work at a grocery store as a cashiet and have for six years and I'm afraid to go to work to the point where I have nightmares about the ordeal. I used to get maybe one customer a month who was maybe a little bit sick, but now I get multiple a day, it feels like a majority of them are sick. The sheer amount of DayQuil/NyQuil I've had to cash out in the last year is ridiculous. I keep my own sanitizer with me at all times and every time I get a customer who so much as sneezes or their nose is even a slightly red hue, I drown myself in it, covering my hands and arms. I've taken to only scanning items with one hand so the other one is free to pump sanitizer without contaminating it. Pretty sure my entire town is convinced I have a dead arm as a result. I never stopped wearing a mask to work and don't plan on ever stopping. My coworkers don't help either, there have been times where we had multiple people with something working at the same time. The cashier behind me, the cashier in front of me, the guy stocking items, if you work at a grocery store where you handle food you shouldn't be working at all if you're sick. And nobody takes any precautions to prevent the spread, no masks, no covering their mouths when they cough, nothing. Now everyday after work I immediately go upstairs, wash my hands, bleach wipe my phone, my keys and my wallet in that order with the same wipe, followed by the toilet seat with a new wipe where I put a fresh set of clothes, then my glasses with another new wipe, washing my hands in between getting each wipe, turn on the shower, then after I strip down get another bleach wipe to wipe down the hand soap and wash my hands one more time before FINALLY jumping in and deep cleaning the shit out of myself. It's not just at work, it's everywhere. No matter where I go I'm surrounded by people like this. My dad thinks I'm imagining things or just noticing it more but I've always paid as much attention as I do now. My mom claims that everyone's immune systems are weakened after quarantining so long in 2020 but if that's the case then why did it wait three years to just one day suddenly look like a scene from the movie Contagion? 

And now I'm tense because I suddenly remembered I was exposed to a coworker's germs yesterday. I was working at self checkout and they always have someone from a register take over on self checkout for breaks, when I got back, the coworker that took over for my lunch break said she was feeling under the weather and coughed a bunch. Guess who still took off for my other break? I tried to wipe everything down but I didn't wipe *everything* down and I'm praying that she just had some weather sinus allergy shit going on but it's physically impossible to tell the difference between allergies and being sick which is a whole other layer to my anxiety. And I don't want to get better, I want the world to get better. I want this phase of EVERYBODY around me being severely sick to stop but it's only been getting worse and worse for over a year. The amount of time I've spent washing my hands is ridiculous, they're so dry and cracked and cut up in places I didn't even KNOW hands could get cut up in.

I think one of the worst things about this is that I have another irrational fear of manifesting things by talking about them so now I'm scared that I'm going to get sick just because I vented about this, but that's a whole other problem for another post.

I have no idea what to do at this point. I'm so tired. I'm so scared.",OCD

238,"The worst my OCD ever was was during lockdown, and due to the general sunniness where I was at the time, some sometimes when I don’t have anything on or upcoming and the sun hits the window in that way that makes the light all fuzzy, I get the exact same horrible feeling and intrusive thoughts I had then. It’s so weird how it triggers that memory just from similar conditions. No matter how well I’m doing it just hits and takes me back to that time.

239,"I don't know what to do. My boyfriend and I have strong conflict resolution and commit to talking frequently and openly during problems, even when tensions get high and we need to take space.

This past week though my thoughts have begun to turn to him and whether he loves me, whether he would hit me, whether he's cheating on me or sleeping with other people, and whether I'm ""in trouble with him."" I'm anticipating anger everywhere, constantly apologizing, asking if he loves me, even begging him not to hurt me a night or two ago when I finally broke down because I was terrified.

He's never ever hit me, and I truly don't believe he ever would. Somehow when he does tell me ""I love you"" first I feel afraid that he's lying, or only saying it to seek comfort? But not only do I know that's not true it's also incredibly mean of me to think about him like that and I don't know what to do.

I feel so lost. I want him in my life, I want a *future* with this man, I want to live with him and see him grow and grow with him and have conflict and have love and I'm scared it's all going to go away. What if it does and I never find love again, what if I'm meant to be with him but I fuck it up because I'm not worthy?

I can't tell if I'm dealing with intrusive thoughts or not, if these are compulsions or just me trying to ""save my relationship"" or exert control?? Any input appreciated, I feel scared and crazy and alone and he's in meetings and probably doesn't want to talk about it anymore",OCD
240,"So I’ve been in choir for like forever, and at my school you have to be in the spring musical if you’re in choir. Today we were working on our bows, and when I walked on stage a bit late I was at the end of the line, which wasn’t really a big deal but ofc you have to hold hands with the people next to you. It’s icky to me in general but whatever, I mean it’s what I have to do and it’s only at the end of the show anyways.

As a lot of you might know though, kids with down syndrome and other similar conditions (idk if that’s the right word I’m not trying to be insensitive I swear) aren’t always the most hygienic and I had to hold his hand five times when we were practicing which was SO uncomfortable for me. Afterwards I just had my right hand clenched for like 20 minutes because I was on the verge of literally tweaking out and I feel so bad because he can’t help it, he doesn’t think about those kinds of things (washing your hands often and all that) but I also couldn’t help being so disgusted and I just feel terrible about it. I washed my hands a bunch after we got out of class and now I’m in the stall basically chain smoking (vaping). I really wish I wasn’t like this he’s awesome and he always has something nice to say about everyone around him- I’m medicated and everything too like I don’t wash my hands *as* much as I used to and I don’t have to count things anymore when I touch them (I used to do it in multiples of 3 which was annoying as fuck I’d be up to 12 or 18 sometimes lmao) but when we held hands I felt my skin crawling like I how used to when I felt gross and needed to do my compulsions and stuff and I couldn’t focus on anything else.

I have bipolar 2 and OCD. My psychiatrist suggested Prozac in addition to the Lamictal I've been taking for years.

So now I'm worried about the Prozac, and it is sitting on my dresser. I'm also really worried about weight gain, which I know is vain and I have to weigh the pros and cons.

does this sound crazy? i mean yeah. it’s ocd. i have a very “don’t dismiss anything until it’s disproven” mindset, so that really doesn’t help. i literally will not dismiss any idea, religion, or thought that hasn’t been physically tested and disproven, and my ocd and superstition doesn’t help at all, so i feel like there’s nothing that can make me stop it. i know ERP and CBT, it’s just easier said than to do.

I see someone taking their life on a movie, I look away. The same goes with other themes. But this one is really scary. I just want to be a better person and improve my life. I'm trying and I know I've got this.

I should say that I don't want to do nothing of the sort at all. It's not real ideation. They're thoughts. At the same time, OCD uses my depression to get leverage. I'm having a hard time in life. I've been taking Clomipramine (50 mg)  and Luvox (50 mg). I will see my analyst today and tomorrow I'll see my psychiatrist to see if we'll change something in the meds.

without any specifics (I don’t know if anyone else has this theme but do not want to trigger it) reassurance would be telling me that this thing isn’t my fault, won’t happen to me or my loved ones, etc. I’m not looking for that, I promise.

As much as I wanted to, I just couldn't enjoy the moments spent with the people I love, places I like or basically anything I enjoy. 

I'll try to explain it as much as I can.

For example, I love my parents and I want to spend quality time with them and I want to *feel* like I've ""fully lived or experienced"" that prescious moments together (I am hyperconscious of death and time passing) but every time I end up just frustrated, anxious and empty because it wasn't...perfect. Like I wasn't trying enough to ""live up"" those moments.

I get frustrated I wasn't ""fully aware"" or that I wasn't ""perfectly appreciating"" every little interaction, conversation, situation with them. 

And I get frustrated, depressive and even angry which just make everything worse and I end up spending less quality time with them because of my inner frustration.

But it doesn't apply to parents or people only.

It's everything.

I cannot ""perfectly embrace"" moments by the sea, on the vacation, in the museum, etc....

I get hyperaware of that ""I'll only experience this one in life"" and I cannot fully grasp it and enjoy at all.

This made me hyper avoidant of everything because I just end up suicidal and unfulfilled.

But even if my medication ever gets me better, I cannot be at peace with the fact that everything that I ""lived through"" by that moment somehow in my mind ""doesn't count"".

And I feel like I wasted all of my 20+ years of life because of this frustrating torture in my mind.

All of my beautiful moments became bad memories because OCD just ruins everything. 

At this point I am seriously regretting the fact that I was ever born and I just don't want to be part of life anymore.

275,"Hi all,

I've got Pure OCD and have been on an SSRI (Sertraline) for several years. However, I slacked off and stopped taking the SSRI for around 4 weeks during the festive season while I was on holiday. Now I am back to taking it, and have been for around 2.5-3 weeks, but it is taking a while to do anything meaningful.

Important to note: the SSRI has worked for me brilliantly before - so I don't doubt that it will kick in again. But I am going to the doctor to get my new script tomorrow, and I am wondering if it would be worth asking for one of the stronger anxiety-related meds to help my anxiety more immediately while I wait for the SSRI kicks in.

279,"Just sharing a little message of hope to all of you.

After being unable to go to work for 3 weeks due to a mental breakdown, I spent a lot of time doing everything in my power to take care of myself, build routine and treat myself and my OCD with more kindness. I refused to give it power. I was tired. I just wanted to function again. I felt defeated, disappointed in myself - you've gotten better, why did it come back?

Last year was incredibly eventful and overstimulating for me so I was bound to hit that wall and OCD would flare up severely again, paralyzing me. Again.

But - therapy from the last years and lots of advice from a lot of lovely people are the world popped into my mind. I refused to act. I refused to give it power. It was extremely uncomfortable at first. I also realized I've built a loot of tools and safety nets that would just end up triggering compulsions instead of helping me. But. I didn't make in the moment decisions when I was uncertain. Get rid of my journal? Not get rid of my journal? Is it good? Is it bad for me? Don't make any rash decisions or you'll end up just creating a new source of anxiety. Instead - I tried to find things in my environment that would cause uncertainty and anxiety - and shift them to tools that would serve me, not me them. A mindfulness jar with little positive thoughts in them, it ended up as a reassurance machine. I've put more notes into it than take out of them. Now I know. Got rid of it. Doesn't serve me. Feeling anxious about having spreadsheets about things and how often I should check them and update them. Just because my brain sends my body signal that declares we are in great danger, if what we do is not cohesive enough.

My games tracker?
It was an excel sheet. I ended up being unable to play games before opening that file and reviewing it carefully. It had to feel just right. I shifted it, now i don't have that sheet anymore. Now my games are managed individually on each console or launcher, where they are being used.

Get rid of safety nets, but think about it. Does it make me feel good or stressed. Is it important? When uncertainty comes think about this: too many safety nets will keep you trapped. Relying on asking your loved one can be a safety net. Googling and YouTube videos can be a safety net. A collection of thoughts, in any place, can be a safety net. Use tools where you need them. And pay close attention to how they make you feel and observe how you use them. At least in my case, this got a lot of longer term relief. I didn't realize that the tools were what kept me trapped.

Making music is my great passion. My outlet. My most significant way of adding to the world. I haven't made music in a year because I was too busy tracking all my ideas and projects, in case I forget them. Out of fear. Only now I realized that tool I used to do that didn't serve me. I served it. But I wasn't actually sitting down and making music. I had to check my list first. It took my ability to just open up my software and start creating. Because there was so many ""due projects and ideas"" and I must check them first. Creativity does not work that way. It's not a to do list. Inspiration is fleeting. And it was such a horrible feeling. Imagine you dedicate your life to being a painter. But every time you try to draw, handcuffs appear in your wrists and you have to look for the key.

I kept reminding myself that there is no problem, I am safe, there is no threat. Focussing on my trying my best to go to bed at the same time. Build routines and habits I look forward to. Same time, every day, I take 10 minutes to just be, go outside, meditate. And stick to it. No longer sinking in the idea of ""I'm not doing enough"". Kindness to yourself - it's so crucial.

Don't try to solve the problem and the content dissolves.

I cannot believe I felt a day of peace. Of calm. My spouse was home, I played a game on the couch. I wasn't going in circles in our apartment fixing this or that. I just felt calm. There was no ""next"" problem to solve. I couldn't believe it. My final hurdle was being scared of forgetting about OCD when I kept doing so. And now? The world has a different light. I didn't know life could be like this. Even if this is feeling doesn't last forever.

I'm scared to let go of OCD. Scared to let go of a broken toy that didn't benefit me in the slightest.

Because when we are kind to ourselves and engage with the things we love we start to see that the problems our OCD declares are not problems at all.
An overactive alert system putting WARNING labels on almost everything.

When we do what we love, we get immersed, excited, grateful. You lose track of time. You lose track of the fact everything is finite. Why? Because in that moment - it does not matter. All that matters is what you want out if this life, no one else can tell you differently. And you can and will live with the consequences.

The truth is, we can know the answer to everything in this universe. But would that change anything about our existence? The whole thing about uncertainty is, there is probably a kazillion universes in which you made different decisions, commitments, life paths. There is no best case scenario. In all of them, you will do things you are proud of in one way or another.

I tell you know if I had the answer to my OCD latching into existensialism and why this universe is here - I see now: nothing would change.

I'd still love video games. I'd still make music. I'd still be here and do what I do, every day. The same way.

There is no problem. You are safe. And you are deserving of happiness, deserving of spending your life the way you want it. 

I quote Porter Robinson in ""I wanna lose my phone one more time"". We make mistakes, bad things happen. And then? Then we deal with it - a real problem, right in front of us. And what do we learn? Half of the time these problems don't even have negative consequences. They inspire us, to do better, to try new things.

I'm just grateful that I am doing well today.
And I believe that you will feel this way again, too, no matter what you struggle with and how much it is taking control over you right now. There's no ups without downs. And when we struggle, we are in a constant low. Unbalanced. Balance is key.

Let me finish this post with something that just came to my mind:

""Getting over OCD is like trying to throw away a broken toy that you feel really attached to. At first, it feels impossible to try and get rid of it. But once you do, you will get over the initial hurdle and you will notice you don't miss it - until, eventually, to a point you forgot you ever had it. It wasn't that important after all.""

Thank you if you read this far & I wish you a great and OCD-free day. Just remember that recovery is not linear. Don't beat yourself up. You got this.",OCD
280,"I was doing ERP in 2022 I have overcame a lot of obsession and compulsions.

Now I have a weird things  weird obsessions that makes me feel like I will lose interest in everything I try to dosomething just goes messed up by doing procrastination or like not doing up to mark

I was wondering I will just do without interest
Sometimes I feel anxiety will strike but I can work along with anxiety, but I am wondering if can affect you like too much anxiety

I don’t wanna take medicines.

I was wondering I could do it better if I have interest  even though I have interest, but my OCD makes me that I don’t. I have lost interest.
Like my OCD is telling me that .",OCD
281,"wow, what a tough one this was to crack, i’ve had POCD, SO-OCD, R-OCD, and magical thinking OCD but this one is by far the worst thing i’ve ever ever experienced.

i would like to shed light onto how dark this one can become, especially if you’ve had some trauma from smoking weed and being paranoid etc.

the intrusive thoughts with this one can get absolutely wild, but remember you can think about absolutely anything with any OCD and it makes no difference, it doesn’t define you or your reality. i’m not going to put any of the intrusive thoughts i’ve had in this post just because i don’t want to trigger any obsessions, but if you have any questions definitely send me a message and I will do my best to relate and reply, because i’ve had some seriously bad thoughts with this, all relating to harm OCD

first bit i can say is talk to people, tell them how you’re feeling, the problem i had was instead of really talking to people about my intrusive thoughts i would use chatGPT. DONT DO THAT, that has created a cycle i’m still wanting to break, but it’s getting easier and easier the less time i spend on it

next word of advice, with any type of OCD but specifically this one i would say, STAY OFF GOOGLE, do not go on there trying to reassure yourself of the symptoms, like i said OCD can make you think absolutely anything and convince you of absolutely anything. if you are seriously worried, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional, like i did, i spoke to multiple, and they all said anxiety DPDR and that was all, but that did not convince me, because how could it be, i was thinking all the things schizophrenics think, worried i was going into psychosis, battling psychotic depression, bi-polar and schizophrenia all at the same time, how weird.

my best word of advice, is to reframe your fear, i know this is going to sound ridiculous, but i kept telling myself how much i wanted schizophrenia, i was so desperate for it, it might keep me of chatGPT if i had someone to chat and sit with, id never feel alone again.

that really takes some practice, but its a really effective strategy, but you’ll find what works for you

and remember, all doctors and mental health teams, even pharmacists etc, anyone with a specialty in any kind of health, are all trained to pick up symptoms of schizophrenia very very quickly, so if you’re worried about developing it, odds on, you’re not",OCD

When i have bad compulsions i can sort of restrain myself to some degree or calm myself but my family members who aren’t the brightest aren’t able to do that

just wandering if anyone here would know anything about that",OCD
284,"I've been diagnosed with ADHD for a while and recently diagnosed with OCD too.

I've had periods all throughout my life where in hindsight I was having periods of worsening OCD symptoms, but recently since I started taking ADHD meds (Vyvanse) it's become a lot worse.

It's hard to tell if that's purely coincidence since I've been going through a lot of stress at the same time, but I'm also wondering if the medication is either A. making my mind more focused and less jumbled so my intrusive thoughts are more prominent and easier to focus on, and the lack of executive dysfunction is meaning I can act on compulsions more easily - kind of ""taking away"" the ADHD and so making the OCD symptoms more noticeable - OR if it's the direct effects of the medication making me more anxious due to the increase in cortisol and norepinephrine?

I'm going to talk to my medication provider about this, but was wondering if anyone had any input on this?

But regardless of medication, another thing I've been struggling with is obsessions with time/planning. It's like now that I have the executive function to do all that for the first time in my life, I'm obsessing over it constantly, to the point where I feel like I do more planning and thinking about what I need to do than actually DOING things and just letting myself BE.

And my medication did used to be helpful but now it feels like it's pointless because when I get the chance to do anything, I'm over analysing everything single thing I need to do and panicking about ""running out of time"" so much that I end up not achieving any of my goals but also not enjoying myself or chilling out either.

I've been trying to practice being mindful about it and acknowledging the thoughts as just intrusive thoughts and reassuring myself that I will be ok if I don't plan everything out and worry about the time constantly, etc etc, but due to having ADHD and really struggling with these things my whole like it just feels like I'm gaslighting myself - I *HAVE* for most of my life been chronically late to everything and gotten in trouble, I *HAVE* constantly had problems due to not getting all the things I ""need"" to do done in time.

And my medication still doesn't magically fix all of my ADHD - I still struggle with being on time, amongst other things. I'm trying to find a balance between having *some* sort of plan and using some timers to make sure I keep track of the time, but it seems to end up being all or nothing - either I am not aware of the time and I have no plan and then I can manage to relax and take my mind off it all, but then it seems I end up achieving nothing I need or even just *want* to, and I end up running late, OR, I make a plan and monitor the time and manage to be on time and do some/most things I need to (although sometimes I get so anxious I don't even manage to do those things) but I spend the whole time feeling awful and still feel like I didn't get the chance to do anything I want to do, or to just be present.

It's so frustrating because it feels like I'm experiencing issues no matter what I do. With other issues due to my OCD being mindful, practicing acceptance and reassuring myself has been very helpful, because normally they are about ""irrational"" things, but I'm really struggling when it comes to this because it *is* quite rational, but the level of obsession and worrying has become counter-productive, ironically.

If anyone has any experience or advice here, that would be really appreciated!",OCD
285,"I have been dealing with “severe anxiety” since I was a child, and I am 100% sure it is anxiety with OCD. I “touch wood” at least 50 times a day and the intrusive thoughts are always popping into my head. I have to do things a certain way to make sure that me and my family are safe, and the list goes on. 

I have been on SSRIs a couple years ago (Cilift, Brintelex, and Wellbutrin) and remembered feeling a lot more clear headed but it decreased by libido radically so I started a new anxiety pill. 

I am wanting to go see a psychiatrist and get a proper prescription again to treat the OCD, and was wondering if I could hear some input on what medications other people are on or have been on and how they were? ",OCD
286,"Marked as NSFW for mentions of sexual content.

I know this sounds stupid. Please don’t judge. I don’t know if I even have OCD, but I have been advised to post here to seek advice since this is so strong.
To clarify, I cannot seek a doctor or psychiatrist, or any form of therapy or medication. This is purely what I can do to help myself.

I have intense paranoia that I’m going to be banned over everything I do on Discord- sending numbers (due to their underage ban, they’re incredibly ban happy over anyone that even says any number under 13) or even saying words like ""sexual"" or talking about heavy topics in DMs like will get me banned. 

I have become increasingly paranoid that my DMs are being watched for any slip up that may be against the ToS to the point that even typing numbers outside of Discord will make me anxious and feel physically ill. I’m also very scared of AI taking everything out of context to the point I have to heavily censor myself even in a private context to the point I’m starting to dissociate and lose sense of myself.

I primarily use Discord only for my boyfriend and two other friends, I rarely talk in servers. I’m autistic, and struggle heavily with changing platforms. I hate the interface of Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, etc., and would prefer to keep using Discord. I would lose 5+ years worth of messages with my friends and my partner if I delete my account or stop using it.

The problem is with this topic is it’s so realistic and could happen that every time I think about it I just completely spiral out and I can’t sleep.

I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed here. I’m really having a difficult time. I need assistance desperately. Thank you.

287,"***Note*** - *Gonna start this off first by saying… I am nowhere near a professional with OCD. These are just my personal experiences.
Also, I apologize if some of these don’t count as OCD and could be something else. I also have GAD and ADHD, so these may overlap a bit.*

Now, let’s get on with the childhood experiences… 

—

**1. Pinterest “Repost or ___”**
Oh, boy. These were some of the worst! All the “repost or you will die in your sleep” “repost or this horrible creature will show up in your room at 3am” “repost or your family will die”, younger me fell for these way too much.
I’d panic everytime and rush to repost them, then wonder if I reposted them correctly or reposted them in time. Then, with the algorithm of course once I reposted one, more would show up. It was a horrible loop and would send me into a hysterical breakdown and panic attack everytime. I fell for these for way too long.
Those posts were cruel! 

**2. Catastrophizing. Constantly.**
Even doing something as simple as going out to the store, or going out to eat, I worry that something horrible would happen. I would always feel embarrassed when I was happy, or get a feeling of impending doom like “you’re happy now… but soon… you won’t be”. I felt afraid to let my guard down and let myself be happy, afraid that something bad or catastrophic would happen. 

**3. “is this real life?”**
Ahh, good ol’ existential OCD (I think). I would constantly ask if this was real life. “Are we all just dolls in a dollhouse?” Maaan, I remember asking this so much. I couldn’t grasp the concept of reality.

**4. Crazy Amounts of Insomnia**
Stayed up all night every night without fail, catastrophizing and worrying that if I fell asleep, I’d never wake up. Or, that the next day something horrible would happen. Or, that someone would break in. All of that “fun” stuff. 

**5. Contamination + Harm OCD**
Constantly fearing that if I touched someone, like bumped into them or gave them a hug, even shook their hand, I’d give them some incurable disease or sickness and that I would bring harm to them by accident. Practiced a lot of avoidance with this one to “keep everyone safe”, because the thought of getting someone sick terrified me.


**6. Stuffed Animals**
Constantly worrying that my other stuffed animals felt left out if I interacted or played with one more than another. I always tried to make sure they all got equal love. I also felt as though they all had feelings/emotions and would feel betrayed if I didn’t play with them.

**7. “Did I say the right thing?”**
Over-analyzing if I said the right thing or used the right word. Googling words I even knew the meaning of, just to make sure it didn’t change somehow. Always asking “did that come out wrong?” Or saying something along the lines of, “I didn’t mean that rudely I promise”. 

**8. Really Liking Safety Rules**
Not sure if this one is OCD. But, I *loved* safety rules. Not sure why, I just really liked them and it brought me comfort to read them if they were there.

**9. “Do you hate me or no”**
Always thinking everyone secretly hated me, was talking behind my back, was going to betray me, etc.

**10. Lots of Magical Thinking**
Wishing at 11:11, wishing on a star (once had the intrusive thought after wishing on a star
Brain: omg did you just wish for your friend to die on that star. That’s horrible… Now it’s gonna come true and it’ll be your fault :/!
I, in fact, did not wish for that. But then I was worried for like a month straight that it’d come true.) 
This also includes my intrusive thoughts being like “if you don’t jump up and down right now something horrible will happen” a lot of stuff along those lines.

**11. Redo, and Redo. And, now redo it again.**
Repeating a lot of things, such as walking in a room then walking out then walking again, writing my name, erasing it and rewriting it until it looks right.

Now, again, these are just *some* of my experiences that I could think of. It isn’t anywhere near all of them, but just thought it could bring some awareness to how OCD can be, how it can appear, and hopefully this post will even get a laugh out of you. :)

Keep going, stay strong. I wish you all the best, you’ve got this! ",OCD
288,"thats it really, some things i have been able to curb but my brain works around it and says if it works so well i'm just horrible and faking. i've spent hours and picked up my phone when i shouldn't while working endlessly researching on what doctors could think about someone of my demographic and presentation, about malingering and factitious disorder, endlessly scrolling fake disorder cringe subs etc. i'm worried i've indirectly caused peoples suicides in the past, everyone except me knows im bullshitting and im BSing myself. but when i shatter my own reality the same problems i've been having for decades crop up again. i'm scared people are out to find and shame me. i'm scared people are going to use words and actions that to me are normal and well fine to me as proof i'm faking serious illness. everything online is baiting me and something is watching me and KNOWS. if i even share that i feel i am haunted it is going to be used against me to either make me paranoid or that i am faking and they are going to find me. 

i have a bad ways with words irl and made a bad impression on my gp plus others as a kid and im terrified i could have factitious disorder on my record or actually have it but i have no idea what to do at all and i am not in a good place. i think she thinks im a horrible trend hopping loser. i feel like a fraud for where my scars are. i don't trust my memories. she probably thinks i am fishing for a DID dx but i just genuinely dissociate alot not DID.

that's it really, funnily enough i've been searching for anyone at all who feels this way to the extent i have, i know too many medical terms and have an ""agenda"" so they're gonna hate the shit out of me as well. 

idk how to not worry, i feel morally wrong if i don't confess, i don't worry. i feel wrong that i have given in the past my obsessions a name to tell it to fuck off but people will know and find me. 

if its not this its something else like people will think i am copying a character and find me even tho idgaf. people will find me for acting suspicious. they will find me for beingn different they will find me for being wrong and they will find me. they think im copying them (i worry to the point i get scared their life/traits have magically melded into mind thru telepathy) and i feel so wrong for existing. they know i'm evil, they know i'm bad news. i ruin everything i touch literally n figuratively. if i put a name to it they will find me. im scared by sharing tbis i've released an infohazrad for other ppl so SORRY IF I HAVE 

i don't expect you guys to know or answer a weird rumination at all or reassure none of this is real but if anyone has experience with these themes and what helps them then i'm lowkey begging u to share 😭 ik i need to professional help but this drives me so insane i don't want to go which feeds into the thing that i must be faking bc i don't want to go. i hate this shit. fuck this shit.",OCD
289,"i need some advice. i have ocd myself and it made me want to become an ocd therapist. i think ocd is very treatable and i wanna help people, i also feel like i know so much about it because ive dealt with so many of the different themes. I got my bachelors in psychology and was supposed to get my masters in psych to become a therapist but i got scared and stopped. my issue is that im scared i wouldn’t know how to help some people. for example, relationship ocd is so so difficult for me and im scared i wouldnt be able to help a patient or give the proper advice. ik the protocol is to make the patient comfortable with uncertainty, but what if they are actually just dating the wrong person. Idk, so much gray area it scares me. i talked to my ocd therapist ab these fears and she told me i would be trained for these things and i also dont have to know everything 100% in order to be good at my job. posting this to see if anyone is in a similar situation?

I have had it since I was a child, but I only newly discovered that all the thought and anxiety were OCD (my mom would always say that I “think too much”, as a child and teen).

293,"Throughout the years I just thought I had regular anxiety but something always felt a little bit beyond what regular anxiety could explain. I’ve probably considered the possibility of having autism a thousand times and maybe ADHD half that amount before realizing it was OCD.

I remember learning about OCD more in depth in AP Psychology yet there was not a single time where I thought ”maybe I have this.” Like I didn’t even realize I had compulsions because I’d still been attributing them to washing your hands a certain times a day or flicking a light switch on and off repeatedly. Even when the lesson included my symptoms like hoarding, I just thought that was a quirk left from growing up poor. Or when rumination was brought up, I don’t think I identified with that symptom bc I was unable to realize that I was even doing it?? I thought it was just my brain having regular thoughts. 

It legit wasn’t until I hopped on this sub and noticed people writing about my exact experiences that I finally realized I had it. It’s such a nuanced disorder, I wish there were fewer generalizations or a wider range of behaviors that were more commonly talked about. Maybe then I would’ve realized it earlier.  ",OCD
294,"Helloooo so I have OCD. I got diagnosed last year and it’s been… Interesting. Rollercoaster. I can see myself getting better and learning to manage the spirals with help from therapy and meds, and my only coping mechanism atm is crying till the “bad days” pass. So. Medication. I’ve read here and heard everywhere that antidepressants are the BEST medication to treat OCD and omg that’s great knowing that there is something that might help me feel normal again. But here’s the thing. I have severe emetophobia. It’s the main obsession. Like yeah Health OCD but it always comes back to vomit. Im absolutely and completely terrified of it. And well… an obsessive mind knows that antidepressants can cause nausea. And I’ve tried. With Lexapro and Zoloft. The first one i tried when i was younger (didn’t know about the OCD) and it gave me the worst god awful hell sent nausea. And that gave me multiple panic attacks (which us why I started taking it in the beginning lol). Then more recently, a bit before the diagnosis, it was Zoloft. Good lord. I tried for a week but the nausea was again impossible to manage and it only made me more anxious and the intrusive thoughts about vomit were ever worse. I dreaded the next day because it meant I had to take it again. Didn’t even made it to the full 50mg pill. Again with the panic attacks over nausea. This time my parents had to take me to the ER because we thought I was having a heart attack and it was unmanageable. Then months after that, I started going to the psychiatrist I see to this day and we tried once again with Lexapro, which I couldn’t even bare to see. Because every time I thought about it, about taking it, panic took over me like… idk. Panic attack at just the mere thought of having to take it. My psychiatrist said it was fine. I had an obvious rejection to antidepressants, whether physical or mental, it’s rejection anyway. So she prescribed me Risperidone. Very little dose. 10mg. And it’s been good! Honestly yes. Good. From time to time I get this feeling that I’m not feeling much like myself and I get a bit depressed and cranky and stuff like that, and then the OCD does it’s thing. Once or twice a month, for a few days. But then I’m alright and more… stable again. Does anyone else have a bad experience with antidepressants? Or a good one? Idk. I’d like to know more about it. Sorry for yapping too much💀💀",OCD
295,"I watched this movie a while ago and I related strongly to the thoughts of the narrator Charlotte. I tried searching if her mind was supposed to be representative of OCD but found nothing. I was just wondering if anyone else felt this connection? For me I definitely have experienced religious obsessions and compulsions, which this movie primarily reminded me of. But she also jumps to extreme conclusions like going to Hell or getting pregnant. But then maybe not because she actually does the things she obsessively worries about doing. Anyway I definitely think Charlotte is some variation of neurodivergent since I related so much.

I’m trying to tell myself that when I see my new OCD therapist tmr, I can just share all of these concerns, and more than likely, they will work with me, but my anxiety is just so high it’s making me doubtful. This is something that I want to do, I’m ready to expose myself, as I’ve been doing a lot of exposures, on my own already. Im just really hoping that they can work with me on this. 


Also, even though I’ve been exposing myself to things. I’m still scared about exposing my contamination ocd. I fear of chemicals and I obviously that’s gunna be something we expose myself too. So it’s so scary but I do have a voice telling me that in the long run, it will be worth it. 

I could honestly just use some encouragement or even advice from someone whose done it💛 much love xx


Update: day 2 of exposure therapy and my exposure was too go on a walk and I walked for 40 mins and didn’t follow through on my compulsions!

i began having invasive thoughts about a commercial plane crash in america when my dad booked a flight to visit old friends across the country. i tried to ignore them but they got worse as his flight got closer. the entire day he was in the air i was inconsolable & engaged in my usual compulsions centering numbers until he called to say he landed safely. this repeated on his flight home, but didn’t stop afterwards. i kept feeling like a plane was going to crash. when i have the same thoughts for an extended period of time, i will do the opposite of what i feel i’m supposed to do to test the waters & reassure myself that it’s in my head. today i let my counting end on odd numbers & i thought it was going okay until i opened my phone & saw a commercial plane had collided with a helicopter about an hour away from me with confirmed deaths. i feel so sick to my stomach. this is the first commercial plane crash in my country in over a decade, if i hadn’t stopped counting today it wouldn’t have happened. how do i stop feeling like this is my fault & i knew it was going to happen but didn’t tell anyone ",OCD
301,"My birthday was on Sunday and number of people, friends and relatives, gave me a Birthday greeting. For context I’m a 33 year old man. I used to do the whole “respond to each one” until I realized how impractical it was. I was trying to not “piss anyone off” by replying to each and every one’s wish in my own unique way. 

I guess I now see it’s okay to just post one big thank you post the next day which I did this year. Then people started posting wishes in comments on that status. Again, a mix of people I don’t hear from a lot, old coworkers and relatives living far away but share history with. And I was so touched by them all. 

I wanted to start replying to each one on the thank you status, but still held back. Because I didn’t want to reply to some while not others still and look like I was singling people out. So I liked each one. Just the classic thumbs up. But a couple are cousins I do cherish and I’m now thinking I should have replied. My past is slightly messy and though I never did anything bad I just went through some tough times that alienated me a bit. So to receive these well wishes has been really nice. But again I just didn’t want to say anything too over the top to spook them away. So I just went with the likes for all. 

But now I’m thinking man I should have at least just said “thank you *insert family member or former colleague*” because it’s just cool to be in touch with them still. I feel like leaving likes for everyone just looks very… apathetic. Even though that’s the opposite. 

So I’d go and say some thank yous but now I feel it’s too late with the likes being left and then to go comment the next day would just make me look so manic and indecisive. 

Thoughts? I currently feel like I’ve done something equivalent to burning bridges with tonnes of people who care about me. I know it isn’t that bad, but still I’d like to try to learn from this or see if from an outside perspective it’s not that bad. Thanks for reading. ",OCD
302,hello i am going to ramble here just looking for advice or if any of you experienced this about a month and a half ago i did cocaine which was really stupid but i was so depressed and i did a ridiculous amount of it and after had awful stomach pain that progressed to my back and it was uncomfortable i had issues going to the bathroom too and fast forward to now i’m still uncomfortable in my back or my joints hurt and my mouth is dry and i noticed i am not drinking anything like at all i have lost my appetite my urine is dark and i don’t shit often or as much as i think i’m supposed to im also tired all the time but i can’t sleep and my heart races fast doing simple tasks i just have almost like a knot in my stomach that makes my whole body feel sick and just yesterday i decided to buy a large reusable water bottle and those liquid iv packets but i literally wait until the end of the day to drink water or i’ll just have coffee in the day i just don’t have motivation and i have ocd so that feeling something is wrong with me is constantly in my head i also dropped a lot of weight quickly but i’m stressed out i just don’t want to eat or i’m working so much and too busy to take care of myself 😔 i just have nobody to talk to ,OCD
303,"Hey there,

I was journaling about my OCD, wondering if i'll ever be able to climb out of the psychological rabbit hole I've gotten myself into over the years. I fell so deep into it and its so dark. but when i wrote that i felt lighter...

and I asked myself, what if its not a rabbit hole? But an incredibly deep cenote or sinkhole with these thoughts and habits and compulsions weighing me down deeper. What if I start letting go of some of them? Maybe I would start floating back up to the surface. Start carrying less of things that hold me down and try holding onto the things that'll bring me up to the surface, and hopefully keep me there. 

I think it might reframe my OCD for me. I hope this helps me, and I hope it helps you. ",OCD
304,"Like the title says I’m pretty sure I killed someone but I don’t know who, it was with my boyfriend and he doesn’t remember it and told me it’s my ocd but I vividly remember some of it I won’t go in detail but it’s very convincing and scary, please give advice not reassurance 

Edit: Thank you all for supporting me! I did end up seeking reassurance and sent *persons name* a text that said “ hi I just realized there’s a lot of expensive blue clay in the red cabinet outside my door, feel free to take it all and share with *name and name/ neighbors* and have fun!” (There was over 100kg of blue clay that I couldn’t take with me on the move) And the person answered “thank you but I think *name* threw it away “ so I know they’re all alive and I feel a lot better but the memory is still stuck in my mind so I hope sleep will help erase i. anyway I really appreciate you all and thank you for helping me!",OCD

306,"I started Sertraline a little over two months ago. I was extremely nervous because part of my OCD is about medication and so the first few days I even had to stop myself from compulsing throwing it up or flushing them. 

I started meds because I’d just moved and started a new job and the anxiety was destroying me. About a week after I started the meds, I got dumped. 

It’s been 2 months and I’m beyond miserable. I cry almost every day. I’m obsessing a lot. I’m not stressed and but my self worth is horrible and I’m exhausted constantly.

307,"i am nearing my wits end with this 😭 seriously how do you get a grasp on this?? health/illness ocd has been my main theme for a year now and it’s hardly improved, i see an erp therapist occasionally and have already done erp before for panic disorder but this feels so different. half of the time i’m not even sure how to do my exposures because it jumps from illness to illness. if i look back at journal entries or conversations i’ve had, over the course of the year it’s varied from fears of heart problems, meningitis, cancer, POTS, internal bleeding, ulcers, kidney failure, UTIs, gastroparesis, cystic fibrosis, etc! it never sticks to one illness, just illness in general, and at any given time i am sometimes dealing with a small weird symptom that is ultimately harmless but makes my obsession 1000x worse than it already is daily. it’s gotten to the point where i miss a couple days of work each month to freak out and see telehealth doctors. i am in it bad right now and i can’t keep doing my life like this. i feel like i can’t accept it because if i really do have a life changing illness i feel like i won’t be able to handle it. i have lovely friends but don’t really have family and i don’t talk to anyone about this. i feel horrible physically and mentally all the time, and i feel so so alone. i really think if one of these things happened to me and i wrote it off as ocd, i would just end up dying alone in my apartment and no one would know for a week. has anyone been able to come out the other end from this?

308,"most themes i have about OCD carry heavily unrealistic scenarios, but what happens if I actually did something bad?

and I'm afraid it'll backfire? 

like it's in the spectrum of real possibility and not a form of fear being built up by actions evolving into actions and etc

like im already thinking of solutions to prevent this unforeseeable backfiring and the harder I try the more real it seems

It feels like I have to prevent it from happening instead of healing myself. if I heal i'll forget about it, if I forget about it, it might happen any second. I dont know what to do I almost don't wanna get better because I don't wanna let my guard down

310,"Hi I don’t want to write much but I just wanted to write somewhere for a minute.

I’ve had this condition for about 7 years, at 18 years old. I have contamination and counting ocd. (Few others but not important) 

I’ve gone from being able to go outside and hang with friends and touch minimal items in year 2, went to intensive therapy (1-2yr waitlist only one) got worse after I got out. Year 4, got drained out and started staying inside more. Year 7: unable to leave my room, my family makes me unable to do anything, I wear throwable gloves on, cannot use my own washer / dryer my parents bought me. I have been told I am medicine resistant (can’t remember right terminology) and that my condition is extremely severe. I’ve had 3 meltdowns today. 

Last few months I got approved for Gamma knife, which was painful, and developed a nose sensitivity what basically screws me over. (I can’t stand smells and leads to breakdowns) I live in Canada and can’t move out due to disability (under poverty) and cannot live with a roommate. (My doctor has ordered/written me a letter that it’s his recommendation to live in a new apartment for my contamination issues in order to be able to recover.) (he is one of the higher up hospital doctors who specializes for ocd.) there are zero supports for housing / wait lists for rent geared to income is 10-15+ years. 

Gamma knife hasn’t helped, I’ve poured 8 water bottles after every time I visit the bathroom. I cannot walk past if someone has used the bathroom. I use 3 bottles if I leave my room every time minimal, which lead to me destroying my parents hardwood flooring. My room has now became like the outside.

My biggest issue is sensitivities what lead to my ocd. I have to pour apple juice to ‘cleanse’ my nose so it doesn’t smell like pee/poo or just the air quality. I’ve gone through over 400 candles in my room, going outside shirtless (I don’t use washroom with a shirt on) 3-4 times a day and spend around 30 minutes using the toilet, then 30 minutes to wash hands. I then go outside and use 8 water bottles. 2 for each hand, 2 for face, 1 for mouth. I have to eat something or drink apple juice so my mouth isn’t contaminated. All I have in my room is a bed, and a table for where I store my food. Which my mom has to buy me. In the past 12 months I’ve left my house 23 times and counting. Most are for less than 4 hours. I spend my money buying new clothing, pants underwear and sweaters (I don’t like open skin.) gloves, blankets pillows and sheets. 

My nose is extremely sensitive to smell and my hearing is sensitive (I can hear and smell anything even from other rooms all the way down multiple floors) there is no pill or cure for nose sensitivities and any smell makes me contaminated / makes me need to ‘clean’ away the germs (even though I know apple juice is not anyway a cleaner, but more so I know I have a fluid what isn’t just water in my nose to change the smell). My parents have to open the bathroom shower for me, I haven’t touched a door handle in my house in 7 years. Nor have I touched anything in my home either. Though I’m more able to open doors when away from home. 

I went out for a walk. Yesterday (2nd time being out this day) as I was feeling suicidal. The second I left my house I felt free and walking went okay. Then when I turned to my street and walking towards it all I can imagine is my parents hating me, and feeling my blood / heart pumping like I’m about to be hung like the old fashion kind of way. 

There’s zero ways I can get out and my intensive program takes 2 years to get in, but I’ve been told if I don’t leave my house, all the progress I make there will crumble. I’ve tried to kill myself once (November, before my gamma knife surgery) and that was because I cannot handle being around my parents and my physically disabled siblings. (Which I hate because I use to love being around my family.) I have no path forward in life either. I can’t get an outside job, I am on disability which is good. I cannot get an online job at the moment due to the amount I cry from my family which causes me to spend my entire day focusing around my ocd (even when I’m sitting in my bed) 

My dad tried helping me be a co-signer on a lease and we had it all planned out but they wouldn’t take me and others have said no too. I have no way I can just have a startup back to life. 

There’s no future for me, and if I was a house 🏠 it would be all burned down besides the garage, which has tons of boxes with me stuck inside. Slowly burning towards me. No medications work, I’m going to going into a surgery in the next few/later  months since gamma knife didn’t work despite the 50-50 odds.

I want to work (and did throughout year 2-4) on and off. I hate how I need help, but there’s nowhere and I truly mean it that there’s nothing I can do. I don’t want to die horribly, I just wish maid was available to me (it’s available potentially by 2029) and my friends/family wouldn’t be mad / upset at me for choosing maid. 

I’m suffering and nobody in my family cares (they just watch me ball my eyes out basically everyday, and get annoyed when they have to help me / sometimes outright refusing.) which actually was the reason I ended up trying to kill myself back in November, I was stuck in the shower and nobody would let me out for 5+ minutes even though they were talking / heard me. I ended up scratching my entire body to the point it stayed for 3 weeks, and I opened up the door and ran to swallow all the pills in my house (which is a lot due to my dads health going bad) my parents have told me they hate me, didn’t care if I die, would rather me be homeless, etc. I have zero supports. Just a hospital doctor what specializes in ocd at the only place for intensive care for ocd in Canada. I’ve even had items  thrown at me, and my parents like to call the police on me by working me all up to full on breakdown / incident then be all friendly and say I’m not okay just to taunt me. I’m just so so so fucked. ",OCD

317,"Sometimes my ocd attaches either mean /bad words, or people I don't like / don't want to think of when seeing or doing something, to things. It has happened to objects, things I want to do, accessories, beauty related things I want to do with myself.. 😩🙃

Currently... It's obsessing again and I'm just so annoyed because my ocd doesn't let it go. 

So basically, the other night, I was on tiktok, someone I know popped up on my fyp (someone I don't want finding me + they hurt me a lot irl in the past with 0 accountability so I just don't want to see or rly think of them)

This made me want to rush even more to make my new accounts, - I was already planning on making new email and tiktok accounts before this, and I did I think, but I ended up not liking the name 💀 

So this was something I planned to do but kept putting off. This night after seeing her account I ended up wanting to make the new email now, and so I did. I love the new email name, it's actually a name i used about a year ago on my old Instagram and so in a way this name was special to me because it's like a part of me. 

Now, my ocd keeps basically associating that person with my new email 🙃
**I know it's pathetic**  ! But I can't seem to let it go ugh! It's just my ocd. Same as when you get random unwanted words in your head. Sometimes my ocd likes to torture me I guess. 

I'd love some advice on how to overcome this? I've overcome many different ocd themes, but this is one I never rly let go of easily. 
Last time I had this rly bad with other things, and it naturally went away, I looked back months later and laughed at how silly it was. Now it's doing it to me again... 

It's just irritating me, I didn't make the account solely because of her, or even because of her.. Seeing this person just made me want to speed it up and move on with my new account lol. Okay writing all of this has helped... 
But yet I can't seem to stop thinking of that person whenever I use the account. 🙃🙃🙃😩


Help! 

P. S I KNOW this is silly and may seem weird or like I just rlyyy hate this person, but, I actually don't. I however don't want to think of them whenever I use the new email as if they are the reason I made it. 💀 Yes seeing them did make me speed it all up, but I already planned to do it before this. 

**Remember everyone's ocd experiences are different, this isn't rly any different to havibg unwanted intrusive thoughts of others and so on**  . 

Now, my ocd is also making me feel like I only thought of the email name because of them, that what if I didn't see them that night, maybe I'd never of thought of that name etc etc. 😩😩😩😩
It's so silly and embarrassing to admit out loud, but it rly is just ocd trying to get to me. ",OCD
318,"My ocd has always been about making sure I feel safe and comfortable at all times to PREVENT anxiety happening. But I’m curious what kind of ocd I have and if anyone else experiences this type. I know it seems like a little bit of clean ocd or germaphobe. But then it’s also about being mentally comfortable in the future so I’m not sure. Maybe it’s also about doing things “perfectly”?

Also it’s been a while since I was officially diagnosed with mental illness and ocd. I am currently trying to find a therapist to work with again.

For example…
I have an entire shower routine and if I don’t do it all perfectly, my brain tells me I won’t be able to fall asleep at night because it will be freaking out about the fact that I didn’t do the routine right. It takes me almost an hour to shower. It’s exhausting.

If I get any kind of extra dirty, like someone in my household who just came from work hugged me, that freaks me out. If something gets in my hair, whether that be outside or maybe some sauce from food accidentally touched a strand. If I put on a hoodie that I know might be dirty (not even that dirty just hasn’t been washed in a couple days) that bothers me. No matter what the “dirt” is, that freaks me out and I usually have to scrub longer or harder in the shower or shampoo twice to feel “clean”.

I have to eat a specific amount of snacks (usually a banana and yogurt and some milk) before bed so I’m not hungry during the middle of the night. Even though I usually over eat the snacks because I think it might not be enough (so I get way too full) and then if I’m hungry during the middle of the night I’ll freak out. (I don’t believe in getting a midnight snack so I can’t do that if I did wake up out of my sleep hungry). 

I have to brush my teeth before bed twice because I need it to feel more minty fresh. If I don’t I won’t be able to sleep because I’ll be freaking out that I didn’t do it right. 

If I’m going on a one day “trip” maybe to a theme park, I have to bring things that I probably wouldn’t even need JUST IN CASE. Like my retainer just in case my teeth feel weird during the day (even though I only wear my retainer at night anyways). Or bringing my deodorant (even though I only ever have to apply once a day) If I don’t bring those things I will OBSESS over it and freak out. ",OCD

I have been dealing with diagnosed OCD for more than half of my life at this point and I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",OCD
333,"I realized my obsessions arise more when I am tired. Obsessions are my brains way of telling me that I am trying to force my brain to work when it can't work anymore, and instead of working properly, it malfunctions. like a processor getting to hot, leading to funny thoughts which are also kind of arbitrary and random. Do you know those old, analog telephoning wires who had this phenomenon of *crosstalk*? That's how my brain feels like, sometimes (although, that is also often a sign of schizophrenia. In my case I believe it to be attention deficit based. Anyways, it does not really matter). In such a state you cannot think properly.

In the past I did not like sleeping, and instead, tried to push my brain to think when it couldn't think anymore for hours and hours with adversary, reinforcing effects. I felt tired, I knew I was tired, and instead of resting, I forced myself to continue working, making me even more tired, weird thoughts became even stronger and so on until I couldn't think properly anymore, at all. This is partly because of social conditioning ""society expects me to be awake at time x till y"", laws I chose to impose on myself even though no one ever told me them. This is essentially the gist of OCD: Self-imposed laws no one ever imposed on you. Compare this to jurisdictional laws: You follow those laws because you know there will be real consequences. Compare this to compulsions: Compulsions in my case, are the result of *self-imposed* laws that no one else ever imposed on me.

To come back to the primary example of sleep: I had this rule, in my own mind, that I am only allowed to sleep at night. But no on else imposed this law on me, when I am at home, I can do whatever I want. So why did I impose this law on myself that I am only allowed to sleep, and during the day I have to force myself to be awake, with arbitrary effects? The reason is I tried to ""social conditionize"" myself. There was this belief that if I structure my entire life, my entire way of thinking, that this will lead to happiness. Another component in this regard is that I always felt ""differently"" to anyone else, and I had this bizarre image of how the ""normal"" person lives their everyday lifes: They stand up at 7am and go to bed at 10pm, so to speak. Everyone. All 8 billion people on earth, and if I am not like this, I am a failure.

As it turns out, when you free yourself from the misconception that the laws you follow are defined by other people, but instead are only defined by *you,* you realize you have free will and can do anything *you* like doing without rules set by *yourself*. I like following clear defined rules without ambiguity (I would love to live in a dictatorship!), to the point where I impose arbitrary, unhealthy rules on myself for self-conditioning. Clearly, this is counterproductive behaviour.

If I sleep 23 hours and am awake 1 hour, I can achieve 100 times more than if I force myself to stay awake 12 hours, as an exaggerated example. Who would have thought have having proper preconditions around you leads to happiness? And, second relevation: No one cares about what rules *you* impose on *yourself*, because it is *you* choosing to suffer in your own misery. This is even worse when you try to justify your *own* rules set by *yourself*, on *yourself*, by pretending they are actually imposed by other people (as in my case).

334,"I have OCD about biting my mouth. I bite the outside of my lips, and I bite the inside of my mouth, usually it's hurt and bleeding, especially when I’m stressed (and when my mouth is hurt, I get more stressed and the OCD gets worse).

The problem is that I’m ashamed of it, it’s ugly and unpleasant to look at, but I can’t stop, so I have the habit of wearing lipstick all the time to cover the wounds.  
I know that people notice the wounds, and it is embarrassing

This started about 10 years ago when I was in puberty and stopped biting my nails, I just replaced the OCD. Before the nail-biting OCD, I was a stutterer (due to stress too).

I feel like I will only be able to stop this mouth OCD if I replace it with something else. Therapy hasn’t helped, and I’m afraid of having more serious injuries from repetitive wounds in the same place. I’ve consulted doctors, and anxiety medications don’t work (I have many side effects).

I'm 19 F struggling with overthinking a past dynamic I had with someone, and I'd love your opinions on whether it was ambiguous or defined. Here’s the backstory:

I had a 4-week interaction with a guy 19M (let’s call him Jake). We texted every day during that time, sometimes long chats, other times just brief exchanges like sharing reels or casual topics. I often called him brother or bro, starting from Day 2, and on Day 12, he started calling me sis. At the time, this felt like a clear label of a platonic bond or friendship to me.i even called him friend 

However, on Day 3, when I asked him about a gesture he made, he said, ""It’s a nice gesture, my friend."" He didn’t explicitly say, “Hey, we’re friends,” but his use of my friend suggested a friendly vibe. After that, we continued chatting daily for the rest of the four weeks.

For context, I’ve had another male friend (let’s call him Adrian ) who, over 18 months, implied friendship twice—once by saying something like, “No thanks or sorry among friends,” and another time, “It’s all for friends.” This friend was more consistent in our bond over a longer period.

Now, my OCD is making me question whether my dynamic with Jake was ambiguous or defined. Here are my specific doubts:

1. Was calling me sis or my friend a form of labeling the dynamic as platonic/friendly?


2. Does the lack of repeated, explicit labels make the dynamic ambiguous?


3. Could this just have been casual, friendly interaction without needing a formal “friendship” label?



At the time, I believed it was clear—it felt like a friendship or at least a short-term platonic bond. But now, I’m second-guessing and overanalyzing.i was hypomaniac during that month 

Was our dynamic defined, or was it ambiguous? How would you interpret it? Any perspective is welcome!

TL;DR:
Had a 4-week platonic texting exchange with a guy where we called each other ""bro"" and ""sis,"" and he referred to me as ""my friend"" once. I thought it was clearly friendly, but now I’m overthinking it due to OCD. Was our dynamic ambiguous or defined as platonic?

339,"Hi all.  I am 25 years old, live alone in a studio apartment with two cats, and am currently in grad school.  I have been dealing with OCD since I was 22, which started as hit-and-run OCD and has more recently turned into health OCD.  

I live in an area where H5N1 was detected in a backyard flock 50 minutes away from me, and there are multiple chicken processing plants near me.  There are also birds everywhere-- songbirds, crows, ducks, etc.  As you can imagine, I have really been struggling with fears of H5N1.  Today I took an uber, and when I climbed in I noticed white feathers, mud or feces, and straw on the floor.  My OCD has been relatively okay lately, and I am taking medicine for it, but I almost broke into tears in the car.  

I stripped off my jacket when I got out, left my shoes outside my apartment, and booked it to the bathroom to strip down and shower immediately.  I then vacuumed everywhere I walked, swept, and sprayed cat-safe disinfectant.  My question is, with a risk to cats with H5N1, where can I draw the line between ""these are reasonable precautions"" and ""my OCD is spiraling""?  I am really struggling to make the distinction when exposures to birds happen almost every day in my area.  

I am pursuing therapy, but had a temporary lapse with insurance.  I am trying to get back into the schedule for it.",OCD

I don’t know if this lice shampoo is toxic but whatever toxin is in there that kills the lice is still all over my hair, body, phone, everything. It’s in my eyes, mouth, throat, nose etc, because it got in there when I rinsed my head and because it’s mineral oil based it’s not coming out with water. Is the thing stuck to my eyeballs? Have I already poisoned myself?

Also, I don’t know what this grease on my hair is that didn’t come off with 3 shampoos. I’m scared it will never come out. What if I want to use heat on my hair? Or dye it? Will that have a reaction? How long do I have to wait to get this out?

344,"Hello! I’ve been thinking about something and was curious if others with OCD might relate. I’ve started to wonder if my OCD sometimes is serving some sort of a protective function when I’m experiencing difficult emotions and pain. I‘ve been going through a breakup, and I’ve started to notice that following waves of grief, I will experience an increase in my OCD symptoms and it fixating on my ex. This then leads to me being focused on the distress from all the things that OCD comes up with, and the compulsive behaviors, rather than the intensity of the feelings that I was experiencing about the breakup. I have noticed this with grief about my cat as well. I recently opened her ashes and felt a new wave of grief, and now even seeing the ashes has become a trigger for OCD. 

I’ve been dealing with OCD for eight years, with a variety of obsessional fears, and I understand that there is not much of a rhyme or reason as to why our brains choose to torture us with the things they do. At the same time, it’s been interesting to me to notice how the severity of my OCD has increased whenever I’m dealing with a particularly painful emotional experience. It’s almost like my brain is trying to protect me from these real life hurts by occupying me with made up horrors to ruminate over. ",OCD
345,"Hello.

I am currently studying Microbiology as an undergraduate. I'm also doing undergraduate research that is related to my field. 

I am curious if anyone here that has OCD (specifically contamination OCD) also has experience or works in this field. I suspect I either have OCD or experience some aspects of it, and although I believe I experience inklings of what contamination OCD may be like, I believe it may be more akin to attempting to be hygienic and being aware of microbes and pathogens in general. Contamination related OCD themes do not impede me nearly as much as some other themes I believe I struggle with, though I believe I could figure some fears/tendencies/compulsions and as a result have some questions for anyone who may have moderate/severe contamination OCD.

My anxieties are always there, but I've learned to live with them.  

I've included my letter below if only to help reassure you that things can get better. I wish everyone the best on their journey and as they navigate these dark and difficult times. 



Dear OCD, 

As I reflect on you, your influence on my life, I can only help but think of the things I’ve lost because of you. I have lost a sense of peace and calm. So many of my days are spent in worry, worry beyond that which is natural or reasonable, as my doubts spiral from good to bad to worse. When in one moment I’m content, you’ve soon caused me to analyze, re-analyze, over-analyze until I’m left with nothing but the very faintest hope that things will be okay. 

You have robbed me of confidence, the ability to rely on myself and my experiences. You have left me thinking I am an imposter, that my faults far outweigh my accomplishments, and that it is only through meticulous ritual that I can maintain my health and safety. I hate you, and in a way, I hate myself, because you are part of me.  

I wish I could banish you, hide you away so I might be better able to face life’s challenges. And yet, it seems in the face of challenges that you are somehow at your strongest, that one obstacle becomes many as you multiply the hurdles before me and turn my feet to stone. You drag me down, and I think of the man I could be without you.  

That sort of wistful thinking is a waste of time, I think. I cannot dispel you or simply hope for your passing. You always come back. As difficult as it seems, I must learn to live with you, to acknowledge you and then rise above you. For my own happiness, I cannot allow you to drive me to fear, to stoke me towards anger. You are here to stay, and if I am to do the same, I must learn to live with you and learn to love myself.  ",OCD

351,"Hello all. I’m on 200mg of Zoloft and 150mg of Luvox for OCD/depression. It has worked wonders, there was extended periods in my life where I could genuinely not see the point of existing because my brain was so muddled with anxiety and now I am happy/functioning every day.  It’s a true life changer. 

Since feeling better, I have tried to go down on the medications to see if I can go without it. Unfortunately, my brain does not seem happy on just one medicine, it needs double efficacy. I would not care, except I’m dealing with anorgasmia/dryness and it is really frustrating because I don’t think I’ve ever been able to orgasm despite using a vibrator/erotica. I would really like this release and it’s frustrating because I feel like I get so close to the threshold but then it tapers off and never comes, and I’m left feeling overstimulated. 

I know bupropion has been said to help anorgasmia from SSRIs while still maintaining an antidepressant quality. 

Is there any one who did have SSRI sexual dysfunction with either of these drugs / at these doses and Buproprion helped? I would appreciate the advice over which one to stick with, after also consulting with my doctor of course.   ",OCD

361,"Hello

The past two years have been tough on my partner and I. His behaviour changed radically when we moved into an old house full of health hazards but not very different from all the places we lived before. All old places have the same issues. But we're owners now so the responsibility of making the house safe is on us.

Anyway, his behaviour changed and I recognised it as contamination OCD. He refuses to acknowledge he had OCD and says I'm not qualified to tell him he had OCD. I'm autistic, I have OCD myself, and my sister too. Hers is contamination OCD as well so I know the signes. He refuses to go to a therapist and says the problem is the house and once we fix it or move out his anxiety will disappear because it's not OCD. He refused to go to a therapist for the past two years but recently accepted an appointment I made for him because he was getting suicidal and could not go to work so he needed a break and I managed to make him realise he needed help by only saying it's anxiety. 

He's not really getting better. I've read that what I can do is avoid indulging in his compulsions and give him stability so for the past two years I've been keeping the house tidy, made him regular healthy meals, keep him on a routine. Sometimes I'm sick of burnt out so I fall short and his OCD gets worse and he acts out on me. He yells and says mean things, like I'm a source of chaos and I'm lame at cleaning and I can't even think about the basic things that need to be done.

Whenever I mentioned OCD he got super mad. He doesn't even realise he has the same speech as his mom when she tried to force him to do her compulsions et refused medication and therapy, he was pissed about her but he is just the same.

I try not to mention OCD anymore I just say anxiety, it seems more palatable for him. But yesterday I had an appointment with my psychiatrist who confirmed he seems to have really severe OCD and is overpowering and gaslighting me trying to make me think the problems is my ADHD and borderline personality disorder. My psychiatrist told me it's BS, I have my struggles but this not fair to make me the sole problem here.

I want to help. He needs medication and therapy. I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed ADHD too and that it's fueling his OCD.

I don't want to hurt him by being to confrontational about his behaviour and OCD, but he needs to go out of denial and get some help. Because I'm not enough. I know a lot about mental health but I've reached my limits.

What can I do to help? I'm scared because I've read the longer he waits for treatment the stronger the OCD embeds itself in the brain's pathways.

Please help, I want to do the right thing for him, 
Thank you",OCD

Or maybe I’m writing this from my perspective so well that I gaslighted you all into thinking it's as bad as I write it to be and secretly I’m the bad person. I have OCD so I don’t know. I never really know.

Short and simple I’ll try to write it. (It’s going to be long) Please give me your honest feedback and if I am being a patronizing dick let me know. Anyways, D (M 22) and I met on Bumble. We talked for a couple of weeks. At first he was cold, hard as a rock. Really “manly” All the classic stereotypes that come from a military household (don’t smile, don’t cry, i’m always right) He’s going off to the military soon. He also acted very insecure, referring to women as “females”, saying he hates all of them, among other things. One night I invited him over so I could officially meet him in person. My friend was there so I wouldn’t die if he turned out to be evil. He had a very standoffish attitude when he showed up trying to be all stoic and a bit egotistical. That first day we kissed and he left. My friend told me she didn’t like him. My choices haven’t been the best recently but that's another story. Fast forward and we argued as we got to know each other. I drank a lot, he complained about every little thing. Put me down, told stories about the people he slept with, and talked about how he was the full package and so amazing. One day I admitted my darkest secret that BEFORE WE GOT TOGETHER I basically sold my body for money. He freaked out obviously, it’s the worst thing I’ve ever done so I understand his anger. He told me and gave me this whole pontificating talk about because he is not shallow he will stay there for me and talk through things. Then one day he blocked me out of nowhere, and I knew how stupid that was. And was gonna swear him off for good, until of course he talked his way back into it.

D is the full package. He is smart, handsome, very fit, and does everything a boyfriend should do. What I mean by that is he buys me flowers, cuddles me, and so on. He likes to rub in the fact that because he can make me c+m, I am lucky to be in a relationship with him. He has said strange and mean things to me that I kind of disregarded because I know I am a lot and have gone through things and done things that are shameful. 

Now the two actual problems: 1. I lied about orgasming for a month and finally told the truth that he hasn’t made me do it yet. I didn’t tell him bc he has an insecurity that sex is worthless if i don’t c\^m. Additionally, I didn’t tell him because it’s a hard mental thing for me and I knew he would try thinking he was the problem. The night I told him the truth he screamed at me, pushed my items around, withheld saying I love you and so on.He even told me to take off my eyelash extension because I look like his ex, who was a whore. Anyway, he called me a fake person, a hypocrite and a liar. Granted, yes I did lie and I felt terrible. He is entitled to his emotions because of the hurt I caused but in the way I saw it was crazy. 

He always stalks my location and calls multiple times to make sure I am where I am. I can't tell if its because hes controlling or i'm just too independent. He is the first man where I have ever had the quick thought that he could harm me. Am I overreacting? Am I a terrible person and bc I have made multiple mistakes like forgetting to block my ex and telling him just so he didnt get mad. Please help.

369,"Im making this post just to take some of my thoughts out of my system.
My obsession always felt super weird, like even weird for the OCD standard, though I'd share some, just this afternoon I started ruminating because of fear of being attracted to my dog, my ocd always covered pretty much all the most taboo things, such as POCD or ZOCD, I was worrying that enjoying my dog's licks could have been inappropriate and I did the worst: searching online, I went on Quora and somehow after a few normal answers I found,  it somehow spiralled into a very disturbing part where z00philes were describing their sexual encounters with their pets, that made me feel sick. 
My ocd makes me believe Im a monster, that I did things like  traumatize my dog, I don't have actual false memories, more like intrusive thoughts that go like ""what if you did X bad action and forgot?"" that always make me start spiraling, even if deep down I know I never done that, like sometimes I think ""if an entity come down on Earth and says it's gonna analyze all my actions, and intentions behind them, I actually wouldn't be worried, I would be happy to obtain certainity"". 
I just sometimes wonder what did I do wrong to deserve this bad of a disorder, it started when I was so young, making me do compulsions and thinking ""if I don't do this I'm gonna lose all my hair and teeth"" ""if I don't do that I'm gonna get cancer"" and all of this stuff, started having mild health problems in middle school (mainly due to IBS) and started developing contamination and health ocd that made me wash my hands untile they bled, making me feel dirty no matter what I did, especially my genital area. Then started the moral scrupolosity and sexual ocd, suddenly I began worrying ""what if I did something inappropriate when I was younger and I had that online friend"" trying to seek reassurance asking ""did I ever do something that made you uncomfortable?"" and even after the ""you haven't done anything! I promise"" answer I still cant put myself at peace, the thought of having done something unforgivable, of being unlovable, of having ruined someone life hunts me, I constantly worry about everything, I developed a SH addiction, I engage in self destructive behavior as a punishment for these thoughts, I became addicted to taking videos ""just to make sure"". It feels like hell, it all got worse when I was SA, not even sure if it counts because my mind tells me I deserved all of it, I started developing extreme fear that I was pregnant at 15 and my life would have been ruined, after that period passed I still had the constant pregnancy fear, even not being sexually active, so I started to fear the most absurd things, like that my dog would have made me pregnant, yes I know, I was young, down a deep ocd spiral, and traumatized so I thought ""okay what if my dog had its way with me, I don't remember, and now I will be the first human to get pregnant from a dog"" it was ridiculous, I know, but I still feel shame for it because I think ""why was I even thinking that? I'm disgusting, if people knew my thoughts they would hate me"" and again fearing to have traumatized my dog, sometimes I wish I never adopted him, but I couldn't have known my ocd would have got this bad and that my ocd would have made me believe things that never happened actually happened.
This is all I had to say, Im not sure if anyone gonna read all of this, but if you do and you relate even to just a bit of it, I want to tell you that you are NOT alone, and you are not the online one to have thoughts so disturbing that you don't think you could have say out loud. ",OCD

Fuck knows HOW, this year it slipped my mind, and now I have about £600 of stuff (over 50 items) on their way to my house that I will have to throw away because they will have been in transit during Chinese new year.

A lot of it was bespoke/deadstock so I can't even buy it again. I had waited all year to get it. I can't do this any more. How the hell am I supposed to sit with these sensations and emotions!? This illness has robbed me of everything I ever enjoyed, I'm terrified constantly.",OCD
375,"I am looking for help with my husband, who I am fairly confident has OCD. 

I am diagnosed with and treated for OCD myself. I still have occasional bad days, but am pretty well treated. When I was at my most compulsive, I was living alone and no one else had to deal with it, which leads me to the issue we're having. 

My husband has a compulsion about clean feet. He insists that every time we come in we take our shoes off (which I agree with and do anyway) but also remove our socks and clorox wipe our feet or immediately go to the bathroom and wash them off. I'm on board for cleaning them after I come in from a run or a hike and I know I've been sweating, but get extremely frustrated when I come in from grocery shopping and can't just take off my shoes and walk through the apartment to put groceries away. 

I know that this is a compulsion because I recognize the signs. What I don't know is how to deal with it. When I have just complied with his other compulsions in the past, it has just led to more compulsions. When I try to gently tell him that this is a bridge too far, he yells. When I just don't do it, he also yells. 

I am so frustrated because he's stuck in the state of ""This is necessary to keep the house clean"" and unable to see the compulsive behavior. I don't know what to do for him or how to manage living with someone whose compulsions are intruding on my every day life. Please, I am literally begging for help on how to manage this. ",OCD
376,"I don’t really know how to call them, but like my right elbow itches so I scratch it but then i feel like i absolutely have to scratch the other one too or maybe when i’m walking and i step on a bump on the ground with the tip of my foot i have to get back and touch it with the tip of my other foot",OCD

378,Please share your success stories. I feel like I am spiraling again and am so scared I will lose control one day. I cannot stand this feeling. I would do anything to not have these thoughts. Please give me any stories of hope. I have tears as I write this. Why am I being tortured? ,OCD
379,Seriously nearly every single aspect of my life has been negatively affected by this absolutely disgusting disorder. I'm falling so behind in college because of this bullshit to the point where I just found out I can't even get into the course I want. I HATE THIS!!!! I HATE THIS!!!! I HATE THIS!!!!,OCD

381,"guys i have ocd, but especially PURE ocd since i’m like 8/9yo, now i’m 18. for the past few months my pure obsessional thoughts are getting worse and worse. to the point i could easily wake up at 2am with a random music on my mind, or i can be mentally doing the same and same list of things to buy in the market even if i already left the market and bought all the stuff. my pure ocd gets triggered by stress. no much anxiety. so whenever i feel angry or stressed my mind start singing random things who not even make me feel anxious or confuse. just exclusively more stressed. so i was looking into iron supplements for treat ocd, since is apparently a good way to manage this disorder, but idk. then my best friend who is also a ocd girl told me her is taking inositol and her problem is getting 70% better. i don’t take any med for ocd",OCD
382,"I am working with a doctor for my medication I am just seeking advice from others who also struggle with ocd and take medication. I don’t know anyone in my life that has been in a similar situation so i need advice navigating this. 

My ocd/anxiety started about 2 years ago. Before that I had anxiety but it was well managed with low doses of lexapro. When my OCD got bad, I tried Zoloft, higher doses of Lexapro, abilify and now I’ve been on Effexor for over a year. I have been on the max dose of Effexor (225mg) since march 2024. It has allowed me to return to work but I am still extremely anxious and struggle to do basic tasks or exposure therapy. I talked with my doc and she advised adding Prozac 10mg to my 225mg of Effexor (she warned me about serotonin syndrome which scares me sooo bad), trying abilify again (couldn’t sleep/so restless on abilify) or going up on dose with my Effexor. I already have side effects from the Effexor and feel very emotionless and flat. I’m struggling with the idea of adding more medication and I’m considering just coming off Effexor completely and switching to something else. My doctor did tell me Effexor is a hard process to come off of and I’m also worried about triggering my anxiety again switching medicines. 

Does anyone have advice or personal experiences with any of these combinations? Also, I am in therapy but since my intrusive thoughts/anxiety is so bad it’s hard to do exposures. I mostly struggle with existential ocd, contamination, etc ",OCD
383,"To keep it short, my grandparents burp yawn fart whatever, I cover my nose and mouth with cloth before breathing, avoid certain objects or whatever the objects touch, don't drink water because of fear of pollution, etc.

But it doesn't apply to my friends. More specifically one of the two. She can yawn and it doesn't really affect me. I just.. don't mind her at all.

I think it may have to do with she does gross stuff a lot less than my grandparents, so it doesn't ""accumulate"" in my head. My friend who does that stuff a lot, her actions feel ""accumulated"", so they affect me more. Plus, I like my friends. My grandparents I have grown to hate, and so have my parents, who also affect me a lot.

384,"I was just casually having a good day yesterday minding my business...

When my brain was like: 

*“Hey, you know what would be fun? Looking back at every romantic interaction you've ever had and analyzing them with a finetoothed comb.* 

*Let's try to find an issue so we can get to work and solve a problem today.""*

I told my brain - no dude, we're fine. I actually feel good today.

But my brain went, **“Wait. You feel fine?? That must mean** ***something*** **is wrong.”**

So here I am, feeling a little anxious over the fact that I’m *not spiraling*. I know it's kinda ironic... 

But the therapy, ERP, ACT and journaling have been working a lot more lately. 

So I've got the confidence to tell my OCD who's boss.

I wanna know if this has happened to you. 

What’s the most impressively dumb thing your brain has ever convinced you to stress over? 

And were you able to just say, ""Not today, OCD"" or what happened?

Sometimes it's fun to laugh at what OCD tries to come up with when we're not actually caught up in the thoughts. ",OCD
385,"first of all I know meds are different for everyone,but I'm just curious as to what has worked for other people,since a lot of the other posts I've looked at had said things like 20-40mg of prozac works,but I'm on 80mg and I cant feel hardly any relief 🥹
I tried sertraline before prozac and it gave me horrible fatigue to like-the point where I couldn't get out of bed.
My psychiatrist is wanting to start me on a stronger medication,and I kinda just want some insight on how stronger medication has affected those with more severe ocd. ( to the point where like,you can't really function normally,at all,if that makes sense. )",OCD

\----------------

Hey team,

I'm a masters student studying Healthcare and Design and I need your help! I'm conducting an anonymous survey for people with OCD and/or professionals who work with the OCD community to better understand how digital technology can be used more effectively to treat and/or manage OCD. The  responses I collect will then be used for the design (and hopefully launch) of a much better OCD tool to help wonderful people like yourselves manage your symptoms.

I myself have OCD so know all to well the desperation that comes with trying to find the right tool or resource but often pulling up a blank (not OCD specific, too expensive, not personalised enough), and so I've taken on this Masters as a way of trying to fix it myself.

Criteria to take part:

1. Aged 18+
2. Resident of the UK and Northern Ireland.
3. Confident English speaker or sufficiently proficient in English to complete the survey without assistance.
4. Own a smartphone or have access to the internet to complete the online survey.
5. Able to provide informed consent and demonstrate an understanding of the nature and purpose of the survey.
6. Not currently in acute mental health crisis or receiving inpatient mental health treatment.

\---------------------------------

You must also meet **at least one** of the following specific criteria during the pre-screening part of the survey:

Lived experience of mild to moderate obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) and are **not** currently receiving professional treatment.

AND/OR

Current or previous professional experience working with individuals diagnosed with OCD or OCPD

387,"Hi there, looking for support && advice as I have been SO consumed by compulsive binge eating and sickening myself. It’s created a really negative headspace for myself worth. I am on Vyvanse 50 mg, it does help while it’s in my system. The evening time is my worst nightmare once I “crash”. Has anyone titrated above there and noticed a better effect? 

Is there any recovery programs you recommend?? Or resources/apps/ANYTHING…. I would be eternally grateful! I am in therapy, but not with an OCD specific specialist. I have a call scheduled with NOCD. I want to live a more healthy lifestyle, and not be so taken away from being present in my life due to this I’m grateful if you made it this far reading, and I’m at my wits end as it’s gotten aggressively worse fast. 🥲 thank you for this forum and community. I just want to heal.

389,"Idk if it's also an ocd thing - I recently posted some of my ""traits"" and turns out many with ocd relate. 

I sometimes crave a ""fresh start"" and so I'll make new social media accounts such as tiktoks, reddit, Instagram eveb Snapchat.. And I've done it with emails too! 

I have about 30 emails lol. I don't use them all, but it shocks me. I didn't even realise I made so many and now I feel like I have so much clutter. 

I think the emails were because I'd want a different email name, and to tye some to my new social media accounts so I rly have so many and I'm just annoyed lol. 

I also have one email that I love the name of, but I don't feel comfortable using it everywhere because my college has it and some jobs I applied for ages ago can see my resume but I don't think they'd even care to re check? And I've heard of digital footprint, does that mean any comments I make via YouTube etc with my email, these people can see?.... 

I loved that email name lol, but I stopped wanting it because I have used the email for all different things that I now don't want to be associated with (nothing weird or bad just me being.. Me lol)

I'm also sentimental, when I make these accounts I plan to have them as my ""forever"" accounts but yet.. I always end up making more. 😭🤣🤣

Sometimes with like tiktok, it's because I cba to delete all of my old comments and j basically don't want them associated with me (not that they are even bad). 

Just wondering has anyone else here done all of this too? 💀 ",OCD
390,"I feel like my life is not my own and that I'll never be happy again. I'm obsessed with death. My own death, my families, when I'm happy in one moment I'll have a thought that makes sure I'm not happy because of my death obsession. I'm also convinced I have cancer, diabetes, i have constant panic attacks that I feel like I am about to drop dead, intense sense of dread and doom, heart palpitations daily for months. Anyway, my therapist hasn't been the best and I'd like a new one. I have heard that taking medication has helped people, what medication has helped you, what is it called, what has it changed? (What were you like before/what has it improved?) it will be extra helpful if the type of ocd you have is similar to mine, but I'd love to hear it all. 
Thank you 🙏 ",OCD

392,I have a confession compulsion. It's been 8 months since last in a spiral but now I'm back again. I can't contain myself. I messed up and did some silly stuff in my relationship and already confessed to it. And promised not to again. But now I'm stuck in the specifics and details and want to confess thoes as well.

I'm fucking crying while writing this.

394,"what the title says.

yesterday, i was having a really nice chat with a online friend who i've known for two years give or take. she made me laugh, i shared videos, we talked about videogames. it was so nice. she gave me her username so i can add her on my favourite game.

the thing is, i'm terrified.

i'm so so scared. because the moment i let people in, i get so attached. i am scared that at any moment, they will find out something bad about me, maybe a past mistake, and then they will block me and think i'm disgusting.

i only have one irl friend, we were playing fortnite. i had so much fun laughing with her. so relieving to all the shit i've had to go through this month. but im terrified. at any moment im going to be exposed and i will LOSE EVERYTHING.

However this has created something of an imbalance. My partner is very open with me about her mental health issues but I don't feel like I can be because I don't want to push her away by telling her every time I ruminate about our relationship, for example.

How can I share how I'm feeling without tacitly reassurance seeking or overwhelming my partner?

Many thanks all ",OCD
397,"Hello everyone! Since three months I have been having constant disturbing thoughts related to joining ilegal organizations, bestiality, p@dofilia, and just putting myself through harmful situations. 

I do not feel amused by this thoughts I feel scared and anxious to the point where I have difficulty sleeping or falling into action upon them.",OCD
398,"I have a weird form of contamination ocd where I avoid contaminated objects like shoes or meat, not actual germs. Contamination is spread through touch, sight, smell and sound. I have to 'protect' things considered 'pure' from contamination, and clean myself/objects by taking showers or washing them with soap.

4 years ago, being in a 'contaminated state' made me extremely uncomfortable and I had to immediately engage in cleaning compulsions if I was exposed. I was hypersensitive to any sources and became avoidant of them. I rarely left my room and I was engaging in compulsions constantly. I became physically ill and actively suicidal from the constant anxiety.

Now, I spend most of my time in a slightly contaminated state. I can just chill, read, learn languages, whatever. I still need to clean myself if I'm exposed to higher levels of contamination or before I can perform certain activities but I'm way more lax with the structure of my compulsions. My ocd is still bad and I struggle to get/keep jobs or drive but at least I don't actively hate my own existence >80% of the time.

My parents don't care that I've improved. They will never be satisfied until I'm completely 'normal'(like I'm ever gonna be normal after losing my entire teenage life to mental illness). When I told them that I could read again(which became extremely difficult for months) their reaction was unenthusiastic, but when I tell them that I can't eat a certain food and need to cook something myself or that I can't study math(which I don't care about but they consider it 'productive' so I do it anyway) bc I had to rewrite the answer repetitively, my mom yells at me and lectures for 20 minutes about how ungrateful I am and how I'm 'not trying' and how I 'don't want to get better' and my dad just gets disappointed. It's created so much tension that I can't have a normal conversation with them without my ocd becoming the conversation subject, so I just avoid them which they also dislike. They also constantly compare me to other people my age(19) and bc I can't hold a job or drive I feel lesser.

After remembering how bad I was 4 years ago, and how comparatively good I am now, it really hurts that my parents actually treat me worse now than they did 4 years ago. It feels like when I make progress, they immediately expect more and get extremely impatient. Also their reason for wanting me to get better has shifted from 'we want you to be happy' to 'we want you to be functional so we don't feel like we failed as parents'. It's exhausting and I feel useless.

Edit- they weren't like this until 2-3 years ago and I probably made them worse

tldr I was completely nonfunctional 4 years ago and now I'm way less sensitive to contamination and can read and learn again, but my parents don't care that I've made progress, they just notice that I'm 'not normal' yet and get super impatient that my progress is slow.",OCD
399,"So, sometimes I have the feeling that my family doesn't fully understand my disorder. Lately I've been feeling that I reached my limit, and I'm just trying to focus on calming down now. The thing is, most of my compulsions are mental, I don't have many physical compulsions, so sometimes it could look like I'm fine, but inside I'm struggling. Because of that, I don't have energy to do anything. My family asks me to do things, but I can't. I don't want them to think that I'm lazy or that I don't care about them, is just that I want to just focus on myself now, because I'm needing this. Maybe this can sound selfish, I don't know. I just want them to understand that is not due to laziness. ",OCD
400,"Does you guys’ intrusive thoughts change topic every time u get them like for example: you get an intrusive thought about dogs then cats then grass then laptops.(this is an example but these intrusive thoughts would give anxiety)

401,"My biggest obsession is things that could have happend + testing them out to a point. For example I would get worried about sending someone some bad message (e.g. ""you are a di\*k, i quit"") to my employer and my compusion would be actually writing the message and clicking on the send button, proving to myself that even going to the edge of my fear, I would be okay and nothing would happen.

402,"I’ve (22nb) been dealing with abnormally intense ocd flare ups since I was 19 and I literally have been just dealing with it bc I thought that was my only option outside of therapy that I didn’t have too much hope in. 3 months ago I spent 14 days in a inpatient facility where they prescribed my Prozac. That shit did NOT work, I’ve heard when using it for ocd it makes it worse for the first 1-2 weeks and they weren’t lying, I ended up having a panic attack on it (could also be bc I was on adderall as well and have autism) and I was not willing to deal with it. A week ago my dr prescribed me lexipro and after taking it I can confidently say it works and is better ts is a god send",OCD

406,"hey yall! i’m new to reddit and mostly joined for corn snake content as i have new little creature in my family. i was hoping to gather information from more experienced people and get support as i adapt to this new animal (i’ve only had a dog, a cat, and a lot of fish).

there were kind people and the mods were great about stepping in to help me. but it was just overwhelmingly negative. people seemed quite unhappy about my question (it was specifically about morphs, the genetic displays of a snake, and what kind my little guy was).

it was very overwhelming and kinda freaked me out. i’ve never really dealt with a lot of online conflict (i mostly engage with online people through ao3 and etc and people there are very nice). i don’t know if i was rude in my words or if maybe people just jumped to conclusions. i was definitely more feisty than i should have been but like i said, ive never really experienced that before. i don’t know if yall have any tips or tricks on how to deal with that sort of thing.

it definitely sent me into a whole spiral and i began panicking about random redditors sending like cps for snakes to my apartment lol. while the issue is resolved now thanks to the mods, i just was curious if yall knew anything that could help for the future

407,I can’t do it anymore. I need certainty in my life and i need it badly. I can’t keep going on like this. I get worse by the day. I’m tired. I just need to be sure. I need to be certain. It all feels too real. And being undiagnosed makes it worse. ,OCD

It doesn't sound like something I want to do, much less accept, but I don't know anymore, I don't fight the thoughts anymore, they're just there, I make a weird face of disgust at the thought, sometimes I scream in a low voice  I keep telling myself that I didn't do it, that I wouldn't do something like that, But I have a feeling, in my brain, like something is wrong, like I'm lying.

I'm also constantly afraid of my own thoughts and I'm constantly tuning out during conversations because all I can think about is how afraid I am of my thoughts.

I know it isn't right and we shouldn't do it, but it feels like the only thing I can do to not do the rituals and keep on feeling like myself. What I do right now is I do a ritual and they try convincing myself again and again that it's all fine, nothing will affect me anymore, sort of a locked state that I don't have to do rituals to do things properly, but I keep on forgetting that after some time, and still feel shitty when exposed to my fears/not doing what my head wants me to.

412,"I had a nightmare where I found a little baby bat and took it in and took care of it, it statted off as a baby bird but then it became a bat and it was those, one big thooted little bats, and in the dream it crawled up into mh shirt and coddled up on my chest to sleep. In mu dream it was the size od a roach somewhat, like the size of a thumb.

but its legs would grow and get under my skin so that it stood in place, then it bit my chest and it was sucking away my blood and once I noticed I pulled it out but my insides got pulled out too and I was freaking out and asked for my mother to take me to the hospital cus my intestines where coning out thru my chest and she just called me silly and that I should sleep it off and now here I am.

I am worried there might be somethinf in my room and I cant go back to sleep. Checked around mu body for bites and im like ok but im asking myself why on earth I would dream of a bat suckong my blood.

413,"Yesterday, I dropped my electric guitar into my laptop, the headstock hit the side of its body, now it is dented on top and a little crack on the side also it sit weird now like unbalanced, but it's fully functional. I feel very devastated and crippled, like losing a limb. Usually I don't take this much stress with other thing, but not with valuable stuff as laptop. I think maybe my prolonged loneliness has to do with this? I interact with my laptop everyday, I have an expectation to keep it in perfect shape for like 5 years, and it's only 1 year since I bought it. My previous one lasted for around 11 years it has scars and peeled stickers but it's not as ugly and destructive as mine today also it's inevitable I guess like rust or little scratch.

414,"I’ve been diagnosed with OCD for about three years now. My OCD has been pretty consistent in what brings me anxiety. I often struggle with harm, just right and magical thinking themes. However, in the last couple weeks I’ve noticed *a lot* of distressing thoughts about like…idk how to describe it…goodness? I know about scrupulosity and I kind of think that’s what happening. But it’s not religious. I’m not worried about salvation or sin or anything like that. It’s just this really rigid sense of doing everything right. Even the thought of breaking a rule causes me to sweat. I keep obsessing that I’ve broken some kind of rule and that people are going to come in and punish me. I just don’t know what rule I broke though! Im spending so much time trying to figure out what I did wrong and stressing about  the consequences of that. 


I’m not asking for reassurance, I’m more curious about how people deal with new themes or a changing of theme, because this is something I haven’t really dealt with in the past. I’m trying to have self compassion and remind myself that this is just a part of how OCD ebbs and flows but it’s really discouraging for me, as I had been doing really well managing my other symptoms, and now this is popping up. I’m trying not to dive into a google rabbit hole of scrupulosity, but it’s so compelling.

I was walking with a large stick which I threw away at the end of the walk and now I’m worried that the man will go back and plant the stick with  my fingerprints on it to frame me.

he's my closest friend so we vent to eachother a lot, and we've talked about drafts and stuff. i know that if anything it'd be voluntary, and he has several reasons he couldnt get drafted, but it feels so real in my mind. its the worst at night, and i don't know how to bring it up to him because we're always around our other friends and i dont want to discuss it over a call.

419,"Why me? (now edited, comments welcome)

Why me?

OCD makes me:


_think I'm lying when I'm telling the truth


_think I'm telling the truth when I'm lying 


_frightened, *all the time*


-feel inverted like the world is inside and I am outside 


-dissociate to the point where I just exist in a world of shapes, colours and sensations, rather than being connected to reality


-feel like I'm living my life backwards: constantly trying to define myself but never actually experiencing my own life directly 


-unable to function as an adult: I'm in my 30s and just moved in with my Dad because I just had to


-sick and sad with jealousy looking at other people: they have full lives, relationships, children *and their sense of self is constant and they feel real to themselves*


_feel sick on a daily basis


_ feel inhuman: I'm a shape, a shadow, a wraith

-feel like an actress: I feel observed and act like I'm in public even when I'm at home

-feel like a character in a play: my mind narrates my experiences in the third person *a lot*

_see random images of the world inside my body, which is terrifying 

The only time I get any measure of peace is when I'm asleep (thank Christ!) or in the moments before I sleep or just after I wake up. And even then I'm obsessively reciting the alphabet.

Even this post is just another attempt to define myself and the boundaries between myself and the world, and to find certainty.

I am tired, tired, tired and disgusted. My life has been a series of obsessions, and *not one of them has been me.*

Fuck this shit forever.

Comments welcome, minimal advice please as I just can't take much on board right now.

I don’t even think about consciously doing it, it’s just a reflex - as automatic as pulling your hand away from a hot stove. 

Today I ended up biting myself again for the first time in months, thought I’d gotten over it but evidently not. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Today was bad, really bad. I was worked up to the point I legit thought I was gonna pass out or give myself cardiac arrest.

423,"warning bc im gonna talk about somatic ocd and body image:

posted this as a reply to a post that i found but i figured id post it here as well. i’ve had bad somatic ocd for almost a decade now but my stomach ocd began when i began sucking in my stomach. one day I ate instant noodles & my bloating problems seemingly began overnight (i had never experienced severe bloating before, and it had lasted three days). my bloating also sticks out like a sore thumb bc im on the leaner side🥲. ever since the instant noodle incident(tm) i bloat to the point where drinking a glass of water has caused extreme uncomfortable bloating. in comparison, prior to the Incident i could drink about 5 large glasses of soda and still avoid bloating. this was a huge change in my body that seemingly occurred overnight, which my somatic ocd has not taken kindly to.

i checked with the doctors and got a scan but the results stated it was just indigestion. two years later, i over-fixate on my bloating and subconsciously continue to suck in my stomach, which has caused food to be stuck in the upper stomach & leads to stomachaches and worse. i also cannot wear tight fitting clothing anymore as it triggers my ocd and stomach sucking compulsions further. during my first semester last year, i felt ill from being in a public space with other people because physically being at school triggered my ocd which caused me to suck my stomach in so deeply i wasnt able to breath. i feel like my body is actively working against my own thoughts, because my social anxiety is not bad but my body is so used to sucking in that i cant stop it. when i try to stop it it forces me to become more aware of the feeling of my stomach, thus the sucking in worsens.

my question is, has anyone been through somatic OCD that has any advice on medication i could use to stop my obsession with my stomach? i dont think any naturopathic stuff could work at this point, and i am beginning to eat healthier (low FODMAP diet) 
and see if it works with my bloating, but my somatic OCD has become so subconscious at this point that it feels like itll take years to undo the damage it has caused to my stomach lol. and ty to anyone who has read this far haha",OCD

It drives me mad. I don't mind people not knowing everything, I don't mind people self diagnosing but pleaseeeeeeeee at least look it up on a reputable website.

Sure, there's people who suffer with contamination but most people with ocd don't have that. I just feel like nobody is getting frustrated with this, I'll talk to people about it and they just look at me with blank eyes. Please someone just tell me I'm not crazy and it annoys them too! ",OCD

So you need to open your eyes to see your partner, because if you keep your eyes closed while kissing your partner, OCD will give you another thought that you left those thoughts because you liked to imagine someone other than your partner.

437,"I am at a loss here, having struggled for years with what I thought was garden variety anxiety but definitely is OCD too. The DARE method worked really well for panic attacks, if you aren't familiar this method basically says, you resisting panic makes it considerably worse, if you instead embrace it and actually try to make yourself panic even more and ask for more panic sensations, paradoxically the panic will abate. I found it highly effective.

Lately I've been suffering from ""brain lock"" in a way that's honestly hard to describe but some of you probably get it. It has to do with medical procedures to try to treat some pain I am having. I get total brain lock because I feel the procedure could make things much worse but I also don't want to keep sitting in fear of procedures and not getting help for my pain.

I am wondering if anyone has had success with something like the DARE method but for brain lock / OCD? Maybe I stop resisting this brain state and embrace it? And just say okay yeah I'm gonna sit here and feel stuck?",OCD

i feel like therapists are just throwing things at the wall and hoping it sticks at this point. i’m not even sure OCD is what i have anymore. Meds did nothing for me. 

trigger warning: i was in residential for a couple weeks and that just heightened my suicidal ideation. it’s getting worse by the day and i don’t know what to do. i have no one to lean on for support. no friends (acquaintances but no body close enough for it to be appropriate to bring this up to), no partner. my family is aware and pretty much goes “aww im sorry” and then moves on only to ask me “what’s wrong?” later on. i’m not upset with my family because they’re not professionals, so i don’t expect them to know how to help me. it just feels a bit invalidating and makes me feel like im faking it all but the pain is all too real for this to just be attention seeking.

So I have these specific OCD types and was wondering if I’m unusual or in fact quite common? 

I have a fear of anaphylaxis

I have a fear of heart arrhythmia and specifically coronary artery disease

Both fears have caused me significant damage over the last 5 years, specifically the anaphylaxis one causing me to self starve and lose 20kg in around 8 weeks!! I only fed on 1 or 2 safety foods I called them. My blood and electrolyte levels were coming back slightly lower than usual and it got to the point where the doctors were saying I should really be admitted to the eating disorder clinic.

I am terrified of catching a disease and requiring antibiotics or anti inflammatories because I simply WONT take them. 

Is there any way I can ever actually overcome this? Realistically? I’ve tried tirelessly and it just won’t go away!

468,"TW: Suicidal thoughts, Sexual OCD, Tics

Hi friends. I'm here to chat about my OCD experience and see if this is a normal experience for others here. This is a bit of a longer read just to give some context, so bear with me here.

When I was a kid (about 5), I started to experience a massive phobia of bugs (any kind). So bad that if a butterfly flew too close to me I'd scream and run away, and if I saw ants in a room in our house I would avoid that room for like a week. Looking back, I feel really strongly that this was an obsession, and was my first kind of ""wave"" of OCD flare-ups.  
  
When I was 8, I started to display the ""classic"" signs of OCD: excessive handwashing, germophobia, fear of contamination. I believe this was my second ""wave"" of flare-ups, and it was also the wave that lasted the longest. I was effected by this from ages 8-12, and finally conquered it at the age of 12. I was diagnosed with OCD at age 8, because a family friend had a child who also had OCD, and told my parents. I then was medicated and put in therapy for it. I've been on and off several medications since this age. I think the only reason I was diagnosed is because I was displaying the ""classic"" symptoms that regular people know about (this was also 2003, so not a lot of people knew about OCD other than the TV show Monk lol).

When I was 8, I also started to develop tics. In middle school they got so bad that I was pulled into teacher conferences for my ""bad behavior."" One of my big tics at that time was rolling my eyes (so much that my eye muscles hurt SO bad and were sore all the time), and my teacher really hated my faces. I also had a bit of a tic where I would flex my ab muscles and make this sort of giggle (but only one) sound.

One of my best friends that I met in middle school thought I had tourettes syndrome (sp?), because I also had another tic (probably my biggest gesture ever) where I would shrug my shoulders and put my hands out like this emoji: 🤷🏼‍♀️

Even between what I call flare-ups, I have had tics present in my life. I have them under control these days (I'll be 30 in a few weeks), but now and then I'll notice myself slipping into small (very subtle and hide-able) tics again.  
  
That being said, my next flare-up was in my senior year of high school. As I got older, my flare-ups seemed to be linked to depressive episodes. All of my best friends in high school were a year older than me, so when they moved away I became very depressed. I then developed a sexual OCD, where I was afraid to become a lesbian and I couldn't talk to or even look at women. I was terrified to ""catch"" being a lesbian or allow myself to look at women. (It took me a long time to realize I am bisexual because I thought for a long time that those intrusive thoughts were coming back; I came out at 26). It was horrifying, and so very hard to deal with. I was so depressed for a week that I couldn't even eat and was having suicidal thoughts. It took me about 6-8 months to recover from that episode.

**SO my big question is, is this normal for other people with OCD? I'm getting a bit scared since it's been so long since my last flare-up. I'm concerned that another one is just around the corner.**

**If you ARE someone who experiences OCD this way, how do you cope with it when the flares DO happen? Are they more or less intense as you have aged/gained more control of your OCD? Are they linked to depressive episodes for you as well? Do you still have tics when your ""flare-ups"" are not active?**

I don't really have anyone to talk to in my personal life about these things, so I would really love some feedback on this!!",OCD
469,"So I've been suffering from OCD for most of my life, and I have this problem for years now. Almost every day I spend my time (sometimes up to hours) reading articles about lead, I have to be meticulous on avoiding touching things that I believe are contaminated with lead (like brass, or chipped paint), but my biggest trigger is that people fucking touch anything that they can get their hands on, and it irritates me if people don't wash their hands.

The huge reason why I fear so much about lead is that it can cause cognitive deficits at the smallest concentrations. I hate being handed with the task to clean everything that I believe is contaminated as eventually I myself will get contaminated, and lead is hard to get rid of.  Even though I've tested objects (that have been found to be safe of lead), I remain skeptical of the accuracy of lead testing kits, which leads me into more uncertainty. It has gotten so bad, I can barely eat, have to shower 3 times a day, can't focus on anything, I cannot function properly anymore. I have talked to therapists, sought counseling, and it had little help to me (mostly bc of financial issues and was there for a short time?). I'm living life in fear and uncertainty that I will have lead poisoning anytime and it SUCKS.

It baffles me that I was completely not like this as a child, because I touched dirty things in a daily basis and came out fine, but I have became hyper-aware of my environment to the point that it is impeding my life. ",OCD
470,"I’ve been trying to get on top of my mental health and feel like the medical cocktail I’m currently on is very helpful. Throughout working with my psychiatrist she has mentioned OCD several times  but I didn’t think much of it because I don’t have any compulsions. 

The main reason why she keeps suggesting it is bc I have bad driving anxiety where I’ll have terrible thoughts like someone is going to crash into me. Or I have to check to make sure my foot can move on the pedals. - which could be a compulsion? Even if I’m not driving sometimes I have to close my eyes to avoid getting a panic attack. 

I’ve been reading up on it and I may even existential OCD. I remember in the 5th grade we were learning how to write poems and my haiku was about the meaning of life and why were here. When I was little I would often think like what if none of us are real and this is just someone’s dream.

Well i am having a crisis about it regarding someone i know, we're not close we don't speak outside of school we don't even speak at school and im not interested but with this behaviour of mine and this person having an extremely heavy social anxiety (she doesn't really speak with anyone in class) i feel like i might be doing something wrong and possibly making her feel uncomfortable.

Need advice because I’m exhausted. For the last week I’ve been noticing my mouth is so wet.

The marks that I lost was due to stupid mistakes and lack of recall because my fucking brain was somewhere else. It's annoying because last year I was sick but I could do exams and I got A*A*B in my mocks so I was predicted pretty good grades.

485,"Hi All! I know I'm not alone with this feeling, but wanted to come here to help cope with it.

Part of my OCD is health-related. It comes and goes, but it has become a constant obsession when it's back. It's all I'm able to think about. Stomach pain? Cancer. Constipated? Cancer. Tired? Cancer.

It usually happens after some sort of trigger. This time around, I got some blood work done at my regular physical and it showed that I had some elevated liver enzymes. I ended up getting a little sick a few days after the blood was taken, and the doctor said it could have been that but that we can retest in a couple of months.

Now it's all I can think about. Pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, something else diagnosed, etc.. It's really starting to affect my daily life. I just constantly picture myself being the sad tragic story of a young person (30s) where things were going well for them and met a tragic end.

For example, I had a hard time being present during a recent vacation because I was convinced I was going to drop dead at any moment. Additionally, every little symptom that pops up ""out of the norm"", I immediately associate it with that. This bothers me to the point where I have actively been avoiding living my life because I'm worried that something I do is going to make it worse (i.e. eat bad food, drink alcohol, get a bad night's sleep, etc.)

I know many others have suffered with this, so I wanted to see if anyone could relate to me on this and possibly provide some advice. And yes, I am currently medicated.

Any words of advice, wisdom, or related stories/feelings would be appreciated!!",OCD

I recently started seeing a psychologist but the sessions are pretty expensive, and I’d rather get assessed elsewhere to save time for actual treatment in the session. I’m just curious who else can diagnose OCD, can a family doctor? If anyone has experience being diagnosed by an MD (not a psychiatrist) please let me know how that went and what to expect. ",OCD

489,"I have been trapped in **obsessive and anxious thinking** since childhood, and I have not become aware of my problem until very recently. I have been overly concerned with cleanliness and washed clothes daily. I stutter, and I have focus problems because of my **anxiety and constant stress**. It's very rare for me to find moments when I am not stressed out or anxious about something.

When my mind gets obsessed with some issue, it feels very complicated, and I can't make a firm decision on *what I should really do* and then feel confident in my decision. I can't study or work on my YouTube channel because of that, and I am sure that even if I solved this issue, **new problems will arise for sure**.

# The Recent Distress

This is what happened to me recently that has been distressing me for two weeks now:

In December, I got my first YouTube income. I wanted to look better, mostly for a girl I like. I had plans of buying a denim jacket, browline or round glasses, a nice hoodie, a leather jacket, etc. But I knew that I was obsessed with glasses.

So, I purchased browline glasses, and I felt good about myself. I also bought Jordan Peterson's **Self-Authoring Program** because I was dealing with anxiety one morning and didn’t want to feel anxious and empty-minded in front of that girl. Although I had wanted to buy it before too, this was a significant amount for me.

Later, I realized that I should buy golden glasses. But I was hesitant because I was conflicted about my decision. I didn’t know whether I genuinely wanted to look better or if it was only to *show off* to her.

# The Glasses Dilemma

I went to the shop just to try the glasses out. I found really shiny gold glasses there, and they gripped me. It felt like *there would never be anything like that in the world*. But as soon as I went home, I hated them because they were too big.

I spent five days taking pictures and comparing the frame with my other frames, but I didn’t know what was wrong. I feared that I probably wouldn’t look good and that I would ruin the time I spent with that girl because I didn’t have the **right glasses**.

So, I went back to the shop and replaced them, but I had to pay for new lenses. As soon as I got home, I hated the replaced ones—not because of something entirely irrational, but because they were *somewhat wider than my face*.

# Current Situation

Now, I have spent a significant amount on Jordan Peterson's Self-Authoring Program and glasses. The replaced ones are also a bit big, but they don’t look bad. **Everyone says, ""Yeah, they look good.""** I even posted on Reddit, and they said smaller frames would look better on me.

Three weeks later, I wish I had never spent money on Self-Authoring and glasses. I thought my anxiety would get better, and I would change my future. But I am still the same because I have done the Self-Authoring—although not so diligently because of anxiety—so I cannot tell accurately about its effectiveness.

# Subconscious Fears

Let me tell you what I subconsciously fear, even though it feels ridiculous:

* *“You spent so much money on glasses and Self-Authoring, and you still don’t own what you wanted.”*
* *“What would that girl think if she comes to know that you have bought another pair of glasses?”*
* *“Why didn’t you buy the glasses in one try? Why did you spend a lot of money on such a little matter?”*

Although the glasses I am currently wearing are said to be good by others, I don’t like them whenever I see their temples wider than my face. The frame is super comfortable and doesn’t slide, but my friend got a nice frame in one try.

# Conflicting Thoughts

I want to look the way I want to in front of that girl, but I have spent a lot of money and haven’t bought anything else for myself. I think it’s just to *show off* to her, and I should spend my money on gaining weight rather than these things.

At the same time, I do like having a new frame. But people really don’t spend that much money on one category. I could save this money or invest it in something meaningful, but I don’t know.

I deeply want to destroy my two new frames and get the one I love, but I have already spent a lot.

# A Familiar Pattern

A similar pattern of thought happened two years ago. I was really obsessed with Disney movies—I don’t know why! Whenever I would watch a Disney movie, I would think:  
*“What would she think of me if she found out?”*

Whenever I think about the past, it freaks me out. There’s this vortex of guilt and regret about not looking the way I could have looked if I had bought the right glasses in the first place.

# What Freaks Me Out Now

It’s not just the regret of the past. What freaks me out more is this thought:  
*“You have the money right now, and there is still the possibility of buying the perfect metal frame.”*

# Final Thoughts

I feel like I would have been happier and focusing on other things if I didn’t have any money at all. My mind always craves new problems.

I just want to become **free** of all of these trivial problems. **But does it matter to her, whether i spent all of my money or not on glasses or waste it. I think i am spending it for her validation but i don't want to look bad either.** I have shared the pictures of the glasses that i have bought.

  
The thing is that i want to buy new frames but i think i am doing that for her only and buying new frames will not make a big difference.",OCD
490,"I haven't talked about it to anyone but 2 people, and I have a hard time explaining it. I tell them that negative thoughts keep popping into my head automatically, even if I don't want to think about it and my brain never shuts up. The reply I got was 'how ? It's still your brain and you control your thoughts, it is what you are thinking' and to just meditate and journal.

I don't know now. That makes me think, what if the negative thoughts are really who I am? Is it really me thinking them?",OCD

492,"who accosts you on the side of the road. You're going about minding your own business when this decrepit, cloaked scam artist with a crystal ball and a shabby tent starts calling out to you, ""Hey, hey! I peered into the future and guess what, YOU'RE GONNA DIE TOMORROW. But if you pay me $100 dollars (act on a compulsion), I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen tomorrow so you can prevent your imminent demise.""

So you pay the $100 and, guess what, tomorrow comes and you don't die. 

Rationally, you know that the fortune teller is almost definitely a scam artist. But dying is scary. As is every other fortune this fortune teller has for you. Not just that, but something about the way the fortune speaks is just so compelling. A voice of reason, almost. So you keep paying to prevent the bad fortunes from being fulfilled.  

Sometimes, horribly, after tens of hundreds of readings you paid for in order to avoid a gruesome, untimely death, the fortune teller happened to get it right. One. Single. Time. They get it right.

 It's a total coincidence that means absolutely nothing. But you bet this scumbag charlatan never, EVER lets you forget the one fortune they predicted correctly. ""I said your car would break down if you didn't come for a reading and PAY ME, and guess what, IT DID. Oh, wait, you're saying you actually did pay me $100 to avoid that fate? Well, I still predicted it! You should always listen to me, see?""

And sometimes, something bad happens that you didn't get a fortune about. Totally unexpected. Not even on your radar. 

Fortune teller says, ""It's your fault your mom caught COVID. You should've been more vigilant about paying for my readings. You better come for even more readings, and more frequently too. Don't worry about your wallet. Don't you know your life is at stake??""

So you pay and pay, and all the while the fortune telling isn't doing a damn thing but collecting a cheque and sitting on their sorry, exploitative ass. Fuck that guy.

498,"Hi guys, question about intrusive thoughts and ERP. I've struggled with intrusive thoughts of various types for 15 years but didn't start ERP until six weeks ago. This has been to address bizarre, violent thoughts. The ERP is helping with these thoughts; their presence has generally diminished. Success! But now, I'm having frequent intrusive thoughts about a completely different subject: a type of object/material that I perceive as threatening. It feels like my OCD has morphed to latch onto a new target. I imagine this is because the underlying anxiety hasn't been solved (you tell me). Is this shape-shifting phenomenon common? If so, does this mean that I will need to constantly tailor the ERP to 'chase' the new obsessions... indefinitely? This second question is my primary reason for posting.
I don't foresee the potential for the underlying anxiety that causes my intrusive thoughts to be overcome. I've had OCD since childhood, severely since early adolescence, and the intrusive thoughts are only one of many symptoms. It's just how my brain functions on a very fundamental level. I want to be free of the constant background noise of these images, but I'm wondering if I'm destined to be forever pursuing my mind's latest invention with a new round of ERP... or if there's an end in sight.",OCD
499,"I don’t even know where to begin, but I feel like I need to let this out. For what feels like forever, I’ve been trapped in a relentless cycle of negative thoughts that just won’t leave me alone. Every single day, I’m haunted by the same questions: What’s the point of my life? Why am I even here? The thought of ending it all has become a constant presence in my mind. It feels like I spend more time planning for my death than I ever do planning for a future.

I’m completely drained—emotionally, mentally, and physically. I’ve lost all my energy and motivation. I’ve stopped working, not because I don’t want to, but because I can’t even find the strength to get out of bed. Talking to people feels impossible. Things that once mattered to me, things I used to enjoy, now feel completely meaningless. I’ve isolated myself, trapped in my own head, unable to escape.

There are times when I feel like I’m suffocating, as if the air has been pulled out of my lungs. I can’t even catch my breath properly, especially when I realize I’ve spent another day alone, doing nothing. The pressure in my chest feels so heavy that I’m convinced it’s going to crush me. And sometimes, even when I do try to speak, I feel like the words are stuck inside me, and I can’t get them out.

I’ve noticed that talking to someone—just having a conversation—offers a brief sense of relief. It distracts me, gives me something to focus on other than the endless storm of negative thoughts. But those moments of peace don’t last long, and the heaviness always comes back.

Anxiety, fear, and stress have taken over my life. Every single day feels heavier than the last. Even the idea of leaving the house or going somewhere terrifies me. I feel frozen, like I’m too scared to move. And to make it worse, I can’t shake the feeling that people around me are just using me—that I’m only useful to them when they need something, and once they get it, I’m left alone again. The relationships I thought I could depend on have become sources of pain.

I’ve reached a point where I hate everything. I hate myself. I hate people. I hate life. And it’s not just hate—I don’t even feel emotions anymore. No happiness, no sadness, just emptiness. There’s this huge void inside me, and no matter what I try, I can’t fill it.

I know people always say, “Try to think positively,” but it’s so much easier said than done. I do try. I really do. But the negative thoughts always win. They’re louder, stronger, and more overwhelming.

I’m not sharing this for pity or attention. I’m sharing this because I genuinely need help. If there’s anyone out there who has felt like this—who has been in this darkness and made it out the other side—please, tell me how. How do you escape this? How do you start living and feeling again?

Even the smallest word, the tiniest piece of advice, could mean everything to me. It could be the difference between holding on and letting go.

Thank you to anyone who reads this, and to anyone who takes the time to respond. Just knowing that someone out there is listening might be the first step toward saving my life.",OCD

Here's the first one:

*Write down three intrusive thoughts you’ve had today and label them as ""just thoughts.""*

The goal is to recognize intrusive thoughts and separate them from reality.

Let me know how it goes for you! And please share your favorite prompts as well.",OCD

502,"So I was walking along the street, and in an effort to avoid an older gentleman, I started walking along the grass to pass him. What happened next is that my shoes slipped on the mud, and I tumbled down and got myself dirty in front of a bunch of people.

So because of my unnecessary effort to avoid the man, I ended up falling down in the mud and hurting myself.

That's compulsions for you; they make you think you're doing the right thing when they're not necessary. If you give in to them, you will be hurting yourself, but if you don't, both you and everyone else will be fine 😊",OCD
503,"My just right and perfectionist OCD is always like: 
“oMG you missed the window to eat lunch you can’t eat it now” — there are no rules I made them up.

“Meditation is only meant to be done in the morning” — there are no rules I made them up.

“I can’t shower tonight because I’ll waste water and then workout tomorrow and have to shower again in such a short period of time” — THERE ARE NO RULES I MADE THEM UP.

My new mantra. Because this has been so helpful it’s like “it’s unknown, I can’t know” when I wanna know more. And it also helps with my reassurance seeking like when I ask if I’m allowed to do something as simple as the examples above…

THERE ARE NO RULES I MADE THEM UP!!!",OCD

I’m getting rather tired of it, I feel like I’m in a constant rollercoaster",OCD

I went back to the same road and there was no evidence an hour later, saw an ambulance just driving on that road but it was not in a rush (no sirens), i followed the ambulance to the hospital even 😭. I also checked the car and it also didn’t feel like I bumped anything.

But I just can’t stop replaying this event and seeing myself crash into someone. I’m sitting in the car having a panic attack. I’ve checked accident reports and nothing comes up. 

I know I didn’t bump anyone cause I bumped a cat by mistake when I was a teen and I felt it and stopped. But I’m struggling to believe I didn’t do anything wrong.

507,"So, I feel like it's my fault that I developed OCD. I'm not asking for reassurance, like people telling me ""it's not your fault"", although I know these kind of people have good intentions, I just want to vent. I know now that I should have behaved in a different way back then, when the thoughts started. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and change things. However, I'm trying to forgive myself for all the compulsions and the times I just worsened my OCD. I'm trying to be kinder to myself and respect me more. I'm trying to find good things in life and let the thoughts exist without fighting with them. It's hard, but I think it's possible. I don't want to give up. That's it. If someone reads this, have a nice week. ",OCD
508,"Karma, energy laws, law of attraction... Idk.

""God"" (quotation marks because I'm atheist and don't believe in any religion but my mind senses some being in a similar role of a god, not related to anything that any religion has concocted or written about) or something is guiding me, everything is going according to ""god's"" plan for me, I pull or people with my thoughts and ""energy"" etc. List goes on...

Lately, I can’t stop thinking about how my eyebrows look. They just don’t seem right anymore, and it’s making me so anxious. Every time I look in the mirror, at least a hundred times a day, I’m hoping they’ll look better, but each time I do, I feel like crying. They’ve fluctuated before, so I keep hoping this is just a phase and won’t be permanent.

I just want them to look like they did before, but the more I look, the worse I feel. It’s really frustrating to not know if it’s temporary or not. I’m trying to hold on to the hope that it’s just a fluctuation and that things will go back to normal. This obsession has affected my ability to study properly. I’m scared I’ll fail my exams at this rate.The frustrating part is that others tell me they can't even notice a change, but to me, it feels very obvious. Now, I’m questioning whether what I see is fake.

512,"I was diagnosed with OCD in the fall after taking 2 months off work and doing a partial hospitalization program. I had what I can only describe as a full mental breakdown which is what led me to the PHP. I am now on meds to manage the intrusive thoughts and anxiety but I am far from “ok” still. 

I work as a data system manager for a public school district. Since going back to work in November I have not been able to make it a full week without taking time off or working from home. I feel absolutely awful about this and feel a lot of anxiety around being a “failure” or “unreliable”. I am torn between taking care of myself and pushing myself to do better.

My employer has said I should submit accommodations to HR to support me getting better, but I am unsure what I should request. I know that requesting a set hybrid schedule (work from home 1-2 days per week) will help me but I don’t know what to do about the fact that sometimes I have a panic attack and then can’t work afterwards. 

I feel such extreme guilt and anxiety about not being able to work or being unreliable at work and I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced similar? How have you navigated this? ",OCD
513,"Basically one of my OCD themes is the fear of becoming morally corrupted/impure due to associating with ""bad people"". It's affecting my social life. I have trouble hanging out with friends who have done dumb morally shitty things when they were teenagers (like 10 years back) because I'm scared it'll make *me* a bad person. I have a very hard time dealing with the fact that some of the people I love have done shitty things, even if those things don't matter at all in the present day. Sometimes I also worry that family members/friends are secretly hurting people even if I have no reason to think that.

I also stress out about YouTubers/actors/musicians etc I like being secretly bad people and my enjoyment of them being ruined and me becoming ""impure"" due to once liking them. It doesn't help that this somewhat recently happened with an author I used to like.

514,"Hi Guys, The last time I have been really struggling with OCD. I also have ROCD towards my Mother which is absolutely the worst but I also have OCD to things that I really enjoy and can’t enjoy it sometimes through my OCD. I’m a singer in a rock ‘n’ roll band and it’s reallly my whole life but sometimes I really can’t enjoy singing and being on stage. Sometimes I also have OCD towards my favourite Artists and bands and can’t for a certain time enjoy their music. Now that I really discovered that I had ocd in the last 2 months (and been diagnosed with it) I really learned a lot about it. I also learned about ERP and I try do that with every OCD theme. For example with the ROCD towards my mother I do the activities that we always did before, I still give her hugs and kisses and we move towards eachother and instead of not doing that. And with music I still listen to my favourite Artists and bands to not do any avoidance behaviours. Is this the right strategy? Let me know!",OCD
515,"hey all, i’m curious if anyone else experiences their OCD thoughts as fluctuations?

in a weeks time, i can fluctuate between: actively seeking self reassurance about the intrusive thoughts, questioning if it’s OCD at all or really me, feeling healthily confident/secure in myself and feeling like i’ve “reached a head” of being over this OCD theme, then the theme comes back the next day or within hours of feeling secure, etc. 

every time i have a (rare) day where my theme is 100% at ease and i feel confidently aligned with myself again, i can always count on that to switch up within at least a handful of hours to where im back to my theme again. ",OCD

I was on Zoloft before and became lazy and unmotivated (dose of 150 mg).

For context: three years ago i (22 F) got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder after i had a  never ending cycle of panic attacks due to obsessive thoughts i had at the time. And i have been in therapy ever since. Trying EMDR, cognitive behavioural therapy and schema therapy aswell as medication (ssri).  All but the medication did not work.

During this time my obsessive compulsive symptoms ( which i now realize ive struggled with since my youth) have worsened significantly to the point it is ruining my life- so a few months ago i have started exposure therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy with my therapist and spoken to her about potentially applying to be admitted to inpatient treatment.

But Something i am struggling extremely with at the moments are my thoughts telling me that i have been faking this all the entire time. And everytime i tell anyone about struggling with OCD symptoms i feel like a fraud because my therapist never specifically said she diagnoses me with OCD, and just sais i struggle with obsessive compulsive thoughts and behaviour. Something eventho it is very much ruining my life to the point my hands are torn, my schooling is halted and i am quite literally stuck in my fears of contamination, health and morality matters. I feel like I don’t deserve the help and feel like by taking it, i take away help from those whom got it written on paper that they have OCD and i feel s o extremely guilty about it and feel like i am an awefull person. Which is especially bad when i actually have a good day because then i, as i do this moment, feel likw ive been faking this so i order to make it up to the universe i turn back to my compulsions which makes me start back at square one.

I am so sorry if this is not the space to post this in but i feel like i can tell no one but my therapist about these thoughts because then i waste their time on potential lies, is there anyone else struggling with  this? Or anyone that has struggled with this?",OCD

I have some compulsions I'm trying to break, so I'm looking for something that would 'reward' me every time I manage to not do my compulsive habit. It could be something you click on the screen and overtime it develops (a tree grows or a cake bakes etc.), so it motivates you to keep breaking that habit and be more in control.

I was bullied into shaving my body at 9 y/o and ever since then I've been shaving EVERY second day. I'm 23 now.

When I see hair growing even after a day, I freak out. I feel disgusting and dirty. That's why I said ""fear"" because while it feels like panic, it's all the negative feelings really. I used to wear hoodies at summer (35+°C) because I couldn't stand seeing my body hair.

One thing led to another and I ended up shaving my face. Now I can't not shave it every Sunday. Moustache every 2 days. 

I can't not shave even if it's winter. My mom and sister say I'm crazy because even when I'm dead tired, I'll shave even at 12 am. So even if I tried to skip even a day, I ended up feeling overwhelmed and gave into the compulsion. If I don't, I feel disgusting.

527,"27m, severe ADD/OCD, and they feast off each other. everything that follows is just context of my reality, i’m unsure how i can help myself anymore. 

due to my nature&nurture I have mastered my ability to mask and appear very neurotypical. i was blessed in the looks and athleticism dept. above average iq & most of my rituals/obsessions/compulsions revolve around diet/supplementation/fitness/skincare. 

thanks to the GQ appearance, overly-refined mask, my health&fitness rituals, + a little charm and quick wit.. I was able to completely hide my inability to live a structured life, all the way until about 25yo. - Only 3 years after starting a carpentry company with my dad. I am the carpenter, he runs the company and keeps my schedule booked. for both of us, this job is our primary source of income. 

I was never been able to succeed in a class setting, or keep stable relationships, finances, or self. and now i’m in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, surrounded by a horde of incompatible strangers and ex-connections that i’ve unintentionally let down somewhere along the way.
 
things have been piling up and catching fire for so long that there’s almost no relief from stress/dissociative compulsions&obsessions. Pair that with my pitiful inability to regulate my own focus/ reward system has accelerated me down a path of isolation and wasted potential. 

I am an extremely competent, hard working, highly-adaptive problem solver. 
i’m also authentic, quick-witted ,intuitive, and very skilled in cognitive empathy.

However I am NEVER on time, i have a poor train of thought, terrible with responding to texts/calls/email, insanely disorganized, horrible planning skills, i can’t stay consistent after i get started on a long term task, and i have a very hard time breaking bad habits.

obviously my relationship with dad-boss is going sour like all the others.

i keep looking for someone to relate to, someone struggling like me. but nobody understands the full scope of what i’m living with. feels like i’m not from here.

534,"Stopped paroxitene about 2 weeks ago cold turkey, this week has been absolute hell and it is getting worse day by day

Last night I went to bed at 22pm, it’s now 10am and I didn’t sleep even one minute, I was wide awake and still am, my eyes, body and mind are all rdicilously exhausted

So 3 weeks ago I was using 60mg daily, was only prescribed 20 but it did nothing so I went to 40, then 60 and had been using it for a few weeks, then I travelled and forgot my other medication for anxiety so I decided to up the dose and then ended up taking 120mg daily for a week which was extremely stupid but it was my only hope and also during some of that time I was intoxicated so I didn’t think straight


After that I came back home and decided to quit, because the 60mg basically did nothing for me, same with 120mg


Symptoms I have:

Brain fog / problems with memory
Insomnia
Brain zap
Being light headed 24/7
Feel extremely weak, like i’ll faint any moment
Flu like symptoms
Loss of sense/feeling on skin
Tingling
Total loss of emotion, feelings and acting very ignorant
Intrusive thoughts

Possibly more but can’t think of any right now


Haven’t really had any anxiety/depression though, all my energy and thinking has gone into those things above, I can’t concentrate on anything at all

Lately it has been taking me like 4 hours to fall asleep and then I can only sleep for about 4 before being wide awake again, but now I couldn’t fall asleep for the whole night and still can’t and it’s making me go crazy

Also because of all this fatigue, instrusive thoughts, loss of all emotion towards anyone combined with bad insomnia I have made some reeally bad choices and decisions which now don’t really feel like anything, but as soon as I’m back to somewhat normal at least, I know for a fact I will regret every single thing I have done lately and rethink all of them.


What’s my best bet? Can I thug this out for a couple weeks and be fine, or would it possibly take longer and I sould seek medical help?

It’s hard because I am literally always thinking about it. How can I not talk about it? This was also brought to my attention out of love and nothing malicious.

539,"So first let me preface this by saying I have OCD and Anxiety symptoms with a bit of depression and ran out of my last lexapro on Saturday and had to make an emergency prescription the day before. On Sunday I didn't get a very good night's sleep because I napped the night before. I ended up staying awake all night and tried to keep myself awake that morning by drinking coffee so I that I could catch up on Arcane. At 11am I started to feel sick and my anxiety spiked making me lie in bed paying attention to details in my body like aches and pains and weakness. I didn't know if these were withdrawal symptoms or if I was sick or if it was just my period but my OCD always tries to convince me I'm dying. 

I had a better sleep that evening but I also stayed up a bit later to finish all of Arcane because as stupid as it sounds I really needed to know what happened. I do think that sitting through all of it was far more emotionally taxing than I expected and afterwards I kind of spiraled because thematically it fits with a lot of real world issues and life after death which I ruminate on. It's such a great show but maybe some of it was too triggering to watch when I didn't have my meds to help and when I have a lot of hormones right now. On top of that last week I lost my wallet so had to cancel my cards, the news is making me angry and upset and I have a lot of study work to do. 

I'm struggling with this insomnia, I had a nightmare or what felt like one, I'm scared of dying or having a psychotic breakdown, I feel like I can't distract myself from images from the show or try and focus on anything else, which means I won't look where I'm going. I cried so hard tonight I was hyperventilating. Thankfully I live with family. 

My appetite is low and has been low for days. I threw up last Tuesday because of the stress combined with not proper eating. I have been told by my pharmacy I will get my meds tomorrow. I want to know if what I have is the start of a mental breakdown or if this will pass once my period is over. Are the physical symptoms also related to anxiety and depression? I've had them before I'm just so scared of having a fatal illness.

I stopped pulling hair from my head, but I still pull from my eyelashes. It's like I feel there an itch or something got in my eye and the only way to relieve the symptom is to pluck the hairs. I had a phase during puberty as well where I plucked pubic hair and I was very ashamed. 

The thumb sucking part I've been doing since I was a baby. I have a baby blanket nicknamed The Stinky Corner because I only put one corner up to my nose and sniff while I hold it in place with my thumb in my mouth??? Don't know how this specific thing came about but here I am, almost 22 years old, with my stupid stinky blanket and an irrational fear that someone will sit on it, I will lose it, or it gets torn apart. Seriously while I'm typing up this novel I realize how much I don't tell my therapists and I should really think about an evaluation... should do it now while it's completely covered by my mom's insurance. 

This whole post is just to say I am trying to stop biting my nails right now and I'm 2 weeks out and have actual nails I can paint, but the problem is I think about them all the time. How they feel against my tongue, how nice it is to scratch my skin with them, how I can clean underneath them, and now I CAN'T bite them off. I'm so sick of having a brain. ",OCD

I'm better than I used to be with managing my symptoms solo but my mom is currently obsessed with buying random shit off of Temu. I've read articles about how heavy metals have been found on Temu clothing/items and I straight up won't wear the stuff she buys me. I feel bad but I want to cry thinking about touching a lot of the stuff she gets me. Sometimes she asks me about why I never wear them but I'm running out of excuses. I know for a fact she'll get offended if I say I don't want anything else from Temu, and that she will think I'm ungrateful.

550,"Over like the last month I swear there has been an influx of pOCD posts or posts about pedophillia. It’s understandable to want to vent and maybe ask if others have experienced what you experienced but most of these posts are asking if people think they are pedo bc of something they thought or something they did, going as far as to dm members of the community asking if we think they are a pedo even after me explaining that reassurance is not good for OCD. And if you look at these people’s accounts they have posted in ten other forums asking the same thing. If you are having intrusive thought in general that are bothering you, you need to seek out therapy and possibly a psychiatrist. We can’t help you, but only be here for you and maybe relate. If you go as far as to touch children in any manner to complete a compulsion you NEED to get help. Also over explaining your detailed thoughts about children or your actions toward children’s goes against the rule 5 of this community. I report when I see it. This is a safe place to get support and to feel validated but it’s not for reassurance and not to spill it all out that is for a therapist. I have struggled with pOCD, and I find validation when I see that I’m not the only one who has intrusive thoughts like that but we don’t need to know the very specific details especially when it crosses the boundary of thoughts and it turns into actions.

551,"For context: I mainly participate in activism online i.e sharing posts regarding movements I'm passionate about to friends and such. I don't do physical activism due to lack of community/social support.  Most I've done is attend a GSA club in high school and wrote an essay regarding ableism in pieces of media.

I've noticed that my OCD has been making me doubt myself in regards to how I ""feel"" about the subject. For example, I worry that I maybe ""performative"" (though I guess in either case, it's still raising the issue lol but y'know) and therefore don't ""care"" much about it. I also have issues identifying my emotions due to autism so I can't exactly ""rank"" or properly describe something I feel for (it feels like trying to identify what is my favorite movie). I've seen a post before on here about activism and OCD but it was different so Ik some people have OCD interact with their activism. ",OCD

554,"Hello. I’ve had rather severe OCD since childhood & have been diagnosed 3 times, once in childhood and twice in adulthood. It’s been a struggle getting through day to day, trying to avoid my own thoughts, avoiding triggers like they’re land mines, and falling down rabbit holes of compulsions. I’m exhausted. I’ve tried medication many times prior, mainly just SSRIS which hadn’t seemed to help, but I’ve never mixed medications. 

I’ll be seeing my doctor soon and wanted to ask for a mix of Prozac & Anafranil, after some research I’ve done about how Anafranil has helped severe OCD that’s not gotten better with SSRIs alone. My doctor tends to disregard most of my requests, so I’m hoping she actually takes me seriously this time. 

Has anyone tried to combination, and did it help? Were there any cons to it? 

Thank you, and good luck to all of you. ",OCD

I may spread the poop everywhere. I may have it on me or around me and not know or be aware of it.” Something I’ve struggled with and I’ve voiced this to her is even acknowledging those possibilities. I’m struggling sitting with the thought of having poop on me and not doing anything about it. It’s hard to acknowledge the possibility without the compulsion. It feels like the exposure prevention coping techniques themselves are a trigger if that makes sense. Acknowledging the possibility is a part of the process but it feels like it’s making it worse.

561,"Not sure how long ago this started, but anytime an object is placed in my hand, without thinking I start trying to test its durability by pressing on delicate spots.

But like what did I expect to happen?I don't get why I'm like this. Like a few years back, my mom proudly showed me an art project a little girl made for her: a candy heart glued to a painted rock. I asked to hold it and immediately pressed my thumb on the heart, and the glue broke. I saw the awkward look my mom gave me and it just... sucks.

564,"I (F23) have been warning my parents ever since my brother was around 12 years old (he is now 15) about how his hygiene habits were not normal and needed specialized attention. My parents ever since about a year ago recognized how severe his actions are now and still are not willing to push him into therapy or help. 

My brother started with washing his hands for excessive amounts of time and would leave the sink full to the brim with bubbles from the soap. It became a habit to also clean his personal items such as his phone or glasses using soap and water in the sink as well. Later on, it became 2 hour showers with scalding hot water, using 2-3 towels to dry off after the shower for separate parts of the body, covering the stairs with paper towels to lie there before he went shower, not allowing people to stay in his room longer than a few minutes, etc. I have heavily urged him in the past to try therapy and told him that if he didn’t like it he could stop but that there was nothing wrong with trying. He tries to say that he has “always been this way” and that “he has to do it” so he doesn’t have to change but the people and things around him do. We recently went on a trip to Vietnam to visit family where he refused to leave the hotel room because the entire country was “too dirty”. My parents give into his habits, specifically my dad, who forces my mom to buy more soap in order to allow him to keep these habits up at full speed and to allow him to do all of these things without any interruption. I am in therapy for related reasons (one being anxiety disorder) and have voiced my concerns to my therapist who also agrees that he is most likely suffering from OCD. I’m extremely upset at who he has become. He is irritable constantly and rude. He is selfish due to his condition and my parents are negligent to the extreme.

567,"Does anyone else feel like they’re just not strong enough for life? 

There’s just so much badness in the world. It feels like evil will always overpower goodness and truth. There’s so much we can’t control. Nothing is guaranteed. You could literally die suddenly one day; the most tragic death, out of nowhere, and the people who love you, if you are lucky enough to have that, have to pick up the pieces and tie up loose ends for you while grieving. You could get injured and have to live with a debilitating chronic disorder that impedes your ability to perform everyday tasks. 

There’s also the depression of personal failure too. You could fuck up your own life by doing something reckless, and now you just have to live with the guilt or the consequences. Or you not only fuck up your life, but someone else’s, all by accident/or unintentionally. 

And why bring children into a world with all of this badness that you can’t protect them from?  
What if you die, and what if your partner dies, and now they’re left without parents? What if they commit horrible crimes that are totally antithetical to the values you instilled in them when you were bringing them up?

I know there are some incredibly resilient people in the world. People who have gone through the worst things you can go through, and they came out on the other side. But there are also people who haven’t come out on the other side. I once heard someone say that resilience is overrated, and I think I agree. There’s only so much trauma one person can take.

I’ve been feeling this way for a while now, and I know it’s not sustainable, so I set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist. I’m not going to self harm or hurt myself, I just really wanted to get this out there to hopefully feel less alone.

I have been texting him repeatedly and speaking to him letting him know I am here for him, whatever he needs. He was showering me with love earlier today because I've been supportive.

An hour ago he came to my desk and asked me for a hug. I wanted to hug him so badly because I want to be there for him and I normally love hugging him when he is showered, but he still hadn't showered so I told him I couldn't hug him. He was a little drunk so got very angry with me and is crying and yelling at Me or ignoring what I say because I wouldn't hug him.

I have been going through a lot too lately (won't go into the details), so I made the decision not to hug him in the moment because I felt like the anxiety and the compulsions afterwards would be too much to handle.

My PcP said if I want to not worry we can do bloodwork which made me more anxious. I feel so down because I was doing so well with my obsessions. They would just pass and I’d be okay. But yesterday the anxiety hit me like a lightning bolt when I saw my eye. I’ve been obsessive about this before two years ago. I was reassured seeing many people online posting pictures of their eyes that are not yellow but more cream colored around the edges and they were worried it was jaundice too.

578,"Hi OCD subreddit, 

So I had an (elective) surgery 5-6 weeks ago, and an unexpected/new complication has arisen in the 5 weeks post-op. I am facing a ton of guilt and fear and rage (at myself), and depression because of this. 

There is a good chance it'll be okay and resolve itself, there is a moderate chance I may need ANOTHER surgery to fix it, and there is a small chance it may be severe and cancer-related. 

At this time, my surgeon's team does not suspect cancer, but I have a follow up diagnostic test in 6 weeks. But on a day to day basis, ever since getting the news (Friday of last week), I have fallen back into self-harm to cope, and I spiral over this every day and have been having multiple breakdowns. I can barely function at work. I lost my drive to be social. I don't want to be around anyone. I don't want to do anything. I don't want to eat. I can barely sleep without medication help (I start crying when I lay down and the thoughts come back), I'm ruminating and researching/Googling shit about it daily, multiple times a day. 

I'm just so scared and I hate myself for choosing this in the first place. I've had nothing but complication after complication of what was supposed to be an 'easy' surgery with a quick healing time. Well, not for me. I fucked myself up somehow, someway, and now I pay the price for it. 

Worse, this condition may land me in the ER at any given time, which I cannot afford to pay ER bills, and I don't know how I will afford a 2nd surgery so soon, as I am still paying the original one that lead to this... It hasn't even been 2 month since the other surgery. 

My question for this subreddit is, how do you cope with the uncertainty/terror/fear of a potentially life altering diagnosis? On top of that, how do you function while waiting for a diagnosis? I'm so scared and it's killing me...if this complication doesn't kill me, the worry and regret will. I just don't know what to do. And yes, I have a therapist. Unfortunately, talking to them 1 hour per every 2 weeks isn't helping the way I need it to. I'm seeking out psychiatric medication help (again) at this point, but I've had really bad responses to medications, so I'm now scared/anxious about that, too. There's so much more to it, but that's the main shit. 

TLDR: How do you cope with waiting times for a potentially dire diagnosis? How do you cope with the uncertainty of what that diagnosis will be? It really does feel like it will be life or death, no in between. I'm so upset... ",OCD
579,"I am currently 30 weeks pregnant. I thought I could wean off my lexapro and stay off it for the pregnancy, and wasn't concerned about it (my first pregnancy I didn't take meds.

Culminating in a spiral after being triggered by a post I read on NYE. Been a nightmare of a month. My OB refused to prescribe me anything because she said there's too much risk for side effects on the baby. Never mind the side effects from me being in near-constant panic. Anyway, I couldn't get in to see my psych until the end of February. So I got an appointment with my primary and got to see her today. She prescribed me my lexapro immediately and told me that the better option is medication, not me being anxious.

580,"Hey, 

It's been a while since I made a post on Reddit, however seeing people on this sub struggling with OCD as well made me realize you guys might help me with my dilema. Sorry if I am not using correct OCD english terms.

  
So, I've been struggling with OCD for over 12 years, maybe even longer but this is what I remember for sure. I am 26 now. Over the time my OCD rituals have evolved into thinking mostly about health issues, especially during covid but I never really talked to anyone about my OCD, anxiety and so on  during my childhood since my father is one of those people who think these issues are not real, even though his wife, my mom, has been struggling with similiar issues as I do through her whole life. 

But that's a different story. Only since I started living alone almost 4 years ago I also started paying attention to these issues and only like 3 years ago I found out my crazy rituals have a name, when I went to psychologist for the first time ever.

  
The first time I mentioned OCD to my psychologist was not even half a year ago and she was shocked I have been going through this for such a long time without telling anyone. I was mostly talking about my anxiety and depression with my psychologists, but never about OCD. In my POV it was almost normal at this point, altough exhausting, to do these daily rituals. Well she was especially shocked because these rituals are daily and happen multiple times per day.  Because of that, she suggested to me to visit a psychiatrist, I really did not want to go at first since I also have a huge anxiety from meds and it's side effects, but since OCD has been crawling into my work and hobbies (been always like that but as I get older it is more and more noticeable) I decided to give it a try. 

  
Well, today, at the age of 26 it was my first visit at psychiatrist. Not kidding. Anyway, I was officially diagnosed with OCD and at least I found out my anxiety, panic attacks and depression come mostly from it. And here comes the part I want to discuss with you guys. I got prescribed Elicea (Lexapro) 10mg and yes, my anxiety about meds kicked in full time. 

Before you tell me, well right now you just want to argue against taking the meds because of the anxiety, maybe a little bit but mostly I am actually curious and this is the reason I came here to ask you, if the same or different meds helped you with OCD or if you have been going ""raw"" and found some other methods that helped you out. 

  
My argument against taking these meds? Well, as I said, even though my OCD is daily, happens multiple times per day and sometimes the rituals are really exhausting. I have been going without any meds (except for CBD) for over 12 years. I have many coping mechanisms for it and meanwhile sure, there are periods where even coping mechanisms do not help I have been going with it somehow.

But still, as I said, my OCD is related from a big part to health issues and I just can't imagine taking meds with such side effects when living alone (yes I googled). I know I am not the only one here who lives alone, but my anxiety is already bad at nights. Also, since I don't have a car, I commute to my work by train and the walk like 3 kilometers, half of it up to the hill (crazy I know but they pay well and I work as IT specialist). I just can't imagine doing all of this meanwhile having stomach issues from these meds (my psychiatrist and pharmacist told me this is gonna be an issue). Sure, I took antibiotics in the past for example but I was staying at home, not doing my daily walk. I mean even meds for allergy make me sleepy and that sends my anxiety into the orbit when I am walking outside.

  
Anyway, sorry for a long rant, I hope such post is fine.

  
tl;dr: asking if I should start with medication (lexapro) prescribed by my psychiatrist today (my first visit ever at the age of 26) after 12+ years of OCD even though I have been going with OCD up until now without medication. Also worried about side effects.",OCD
581,"Hi everyone I had a tonsillectomy a little more than 3 weeks ago. I have been taking 150 milligrams of Zoloft for about 6-7 years now, this is for my terrible intrusive thoughts and depression and anxiety I’ve had since I was small. They prescribed me oxycodone and Tylenol for pain meds after for recovery pain. I took those for about one and a half weeks. No problem I was in crazy pain so it blocked out any other emotions I was having. Now 3 weeks later I’m in almost no pain but I am having extremely loud intrusive thoughts playing all my biggest fears in life, is giving me some of the worst anxiety and depression I’ve aver had. I feel physically ill, it feels like I have a horrible blanket of despair I can’t get uncovered by. I’m having horrible night terrors I’m not sleeping well and I’m always stressed. Idk what to do!. I’m not suicidal my fears are actually based of the extreme fear of death along with other things ,more specifically the nothingness of death. I also had been smoking nicotine for years now and decided I wasn’t going to start again after the 2 weeks I couldn’t after my surgery. I also use weed to help with my anxiety but after the 3 weeks I didn’t smoke my tolerance is so low that it’s hard to use enough to help. I’m a mess and idk what to do. Could the pain killers I was on have caused the extreme mood change! Plus’s the lack of nicotine (I started using  the patch yesterday to help a little) I’m just desperate at this point I could use some advice on this, I’m generally a happy person when my meds keep the unwanted thoughts away but when they break through it’s hard to function. Will my antidepressants start working well again!? Help please! ",OCD
582,"Hello everyone!

I want to preface this by saying I'm not diagnosed with OCD, thought I've been suspecting it because of various symptoms that apparently are textbook OCD. I'm not looking for a diagnosis nor do I want to know whether my symptoms relate to OCD or not. I'm just looking for advice on coping strategies I could rely on to improve my quality of life.
I don't think I'm breaking rule one, but don't hesitate to delete this post if it's inappropriate.

Anyways, the point of this post is to ask for some strategies to... slow down my non-stop thinking.

In the last year I've found myself drowning in my own thoughts. I chalked it up to anxiety, but it became genuinely unbearable at some point, so I did some research and found a lot of similarities with this disorder. This is why I decided to give it a try and ask here for advice.

My most recurring thoughts are ""what ifs"" followed by horrible scenarios. They usually involve thinking I'm a terrible friend/partner, hurting myself or my loved ones.

I don't know if this is just bad anxiety or low self-esteem, but I have these thoughts constantly to the point I make myself sick and have to stop whatever I'm doing because I get so sad that I need a moment to breathe. I didn't even realise it was getting so bad until recently.

I know I can't turn off my brain, and I hope I'm not destined to live this way until I can afford therapy and see what's wrong with me. I have a diagnosis of autism and used to think these thoughts were some sort of hyperfixation but at this point I feel like they're plain obsessive thoughts I can't get rid of. I feel like there's a voice whispering catastrophic scenarios in my ear and it's making my life miserable. Like, I'm just minding my own business and the voice says, ""what if [insert horrible scenario]""

Uh, sorry for the long post. I hope someone has some good advice to share. On a rational level I know none of this is true, but I start doubting myself once I get these thoughts thrown at myself all at once. While lurking in this subreddit I found that you shouldn't seek reassurance and that's great because I rarely do. I'm so ashamed of these thoughts that I can't see myself sharing them with anyone, least ask for reassurance...

Well, thanks for reading. I hope everyone has a nice day/night ❤️ ",OCD
583,"I’m 30f and was diagnosed with OCD As a child. It manifested with routines. Eventually with therapy and Medication my adolescence was less riddled OCD and more depression and anxiety. 

Now I’m 30 and in a serious relationship. I’ve been off medication for 2.5 years. This is my first serious relationship unmedicated. I was doing very well without meds until this relationship. I was unaware ROCD was a thing. I truly didn’t even know OCD could be a thought pattern and not a physical routine. 

I’m constantly obsessing about my partner and myself. Is she the one for me? Is she going to leave me? Will she change her mind? Am I going to change my mind? Am I a good partner? Is she telling the truth? Am I telling the truth? 

I’ve mostly been obsessed lately that she wants to be with someone else. There is no evidence or proof of this. She’s given me constant reassurance. We have only been together a year and I thought I was just suffering from an insecure attachment style. I’m worried now I’ve spent this entire year portraying myself as an obsessive insecure partner. The thought pattern will not stop and I know it’s beginning to be exhausting for both of us. We have only been together a year. 

My question is what medication should I try again? I’ve been on almost everything from the age of 18-28. Prozac made me dead sexually. I don’t want to experience that again. I just want a normal healthy relationship. Anyone have advice or support? ",OCD

I'm literally 18 and I know that sounds dumb but it's literally just because my stomach hurts. I also have really bad OCD. I'm diagnosed with OCD, panic disorder, GAD, and MDD. I am not medicated because they will only put me on anti depressants and it makes me go literally insane. It's really bad. It's so much easier to maintain my ocd and panic attacks without antidepressants. I do want to be medicated but I just can't be on an antidepressant. Recently l've been terrified that I'm going crazy. I don't know if it's because I've been so stressed about my health but I have the worst impending doom and I just don't feel real. I'm absolutely terrified that I'm losing my mind and I'm going to develop schizophrenia or something. I don't know what to do. I've never been so scared about something.

587,"idk. I need to get off the lesbian subs cuz it doesn't help the rocd or the soocd. im bi. I know that, I have a wonderful fulfilling and happy relationship with my bf.

but my brain disagrees. now im slightly worried I dont talk about my bf lovingly enough like bi women do, I do talk about him and how sweet he is to me, and show off pictures to my friends but now im worried im only doing it for their attention and I dont actually like him. but I do like him, a lot. he's so. perfect. idk. I was just admiring him while he drove today cuz the sun was hitting his beard just right and it showed off the red in his hair. I wrote him a poem about it. im just worried I dont feel that deep sense of profound love people describe. I haven't felt warmth in my chest in a while and I worry that I only see him as a friend.

ive been so disconnected from my body I cant feel anything besides nausea, im just numb. I dont crave sex (could be the birth control and the depression and anxiety tbh) and when we do have it its not the same as when we first started dating and im worried its cuz im gay and lying to him and am hiding smthn and am too scared to leave. but I wanna stay. idk how I feel rn, if I love him or not. seeing queer couples before this made me happy and if a relationship came with a woman cool, and if a relationship came with a man, cool, I like both and would be happy with either as long as we yknow, treated each other with respect. now im worried I want what these bi women dating women have and yes maybe I am curious cuz ive never dated a woman but im not gonna up and leave my bf cuz of that curiosity when I am generally really happy with him when im not in a state of numbness and nausea. im worried both of these things are signs my body is rejecting him and telling me to pursue a woman.

im looking for therapy atm. I just wanna feel like me again. im worried that me talking about getting engaged to him one day and being excited about it a) excitement wont happen b) ill only be doing it to check off a comphet checklist and not cuz I love him. idk how to gauge who I want to spend my life with. with him it would be peaceful and exciting at the same time. peace in watching tv together. excitement in travelling together. but im worried we'll be doing this together as friends? if that makes sense? when its not that. I want to kiss him when we travel to a new city for a day. cuddle him in a hotel bed in the future when we're married (he cant really do that rn cuz muslim family). it'd be scary and nervewracking for me marrying a muslim man cuz id be the first woman in my family to do it. and raising kids with islamic values is also scary cuz idk what im doing lol, he's taking a more active role in that part and I will do the christianity stuff and general questions about pride/life things should they have them. especially if we have daughters. I wanna make sure they're prepared and educated both religiously and anatomy/life wise. having a daughter with him seems so nice but I dont feel this sense of warmth in my chest or excitement planning our lives together. maybe its cuz we're young, we're in uni lol. and im mentally putting a lot of pressure on this and figuring myself out. im just so nervous about it all and his parents aren't the most happy about the situation

I dont wanna lie to him our entire lives if I am a lesbian. cuz people go for years and years not knowing so what if thats me? before this, when he and I started dating, I never thought about other people, man or woman. I had him, who else do I need lol (besides friends of course). but dating a woman never crossed my mind tbh, I had a few situationships and they were.. fine? idk. one girl was on and off and toxic with me but I did like her a lot cuz she made me realize I was bi, we dont talk anymore. the other one, she was cool as well but had some mental health stuff to deal with and if I continued dating/ talking to her, I would've been in the situation her gf was put in (verbal/mental abuse). so. but I still ended up crushing on men or thinking they were cute and wanting to talk to them and getting really excited if my now bf would give me smthn or send me smthn on instagram. now its still sweet but not as exciting cuz lol he's my bf now but I dont get weirded out that he's showing his affection for me, caught off guard definitely cuz he's the first person to put in effort into gifts for me, to buy me flowers.

im just so worried that ive been faking everything including our intimate moments. thats a though thats been cycling lately. what if I was faking and never enjoyed him doing things to me and me reciprocating? what if I was only doing it cuz I ""have to"" not cuz I wanted to? I always consented and honestly it always felt great and I was happy and wed cuddle after. when actual sex was added in, there were times it was great and times it was meh and times we had to stop cuz intrusive thoughts flooded my brain. its been more the meh since I got on birth control cuz I dont crave it very often and when I do its not as strong as it used to be. I dont like eye contact tbh(im just awkward, ive always been like that). dirty talk hasn't been happening much lately but when I do it I feel awkward cuz I dont picture myself as this sexy person but when he says smthn it usually causes a reaction but lately, ever since September ish? it hasn't really. or its very minimal but I think thats cuz I was cycling thought obsessions and compulsions so often that ive now numbed out to everything and having birth control stuck in my arm certainly does not help at all.

my bf has more responsive libido and so do I tbh, so neither of us really ask for sex unless the other wants it, its more him telling me we only do it if i want to. he's not the type to get upset over not having sex. he knows ive been off mentally. im worried ive lost feelings or smthn and thats why I dont want sex? I dont even feel like trying to want it lately cuz im so drained. my dog passed last night. school is confusing. im terrified of his parents. his sister just got married so now they turn to my bf, their eldest son and his non muslim gf. and its impacting my energy for the romantic part of the relationship. our anniversary is in a couple weeks (the day before valentines day) and I have an exam that day and one the day before (im so done bro). so I have no mental energy to plan a gift even tho I have one in mind, and im trying to make a little valentines day basket or smthn cute. but I have no energy to and im worried its cuz I dont want to? even tho I do. but what if im only doing it cuz I see him as a friend? what if I do all this and then breakup with him (I think this is the biggest one) do I want to breakup with him? do I even love him? do I love him enough as a bi woman who has the capacity to like both?

idk man. im tired. I haven't posted here in a bit (a couple days maybe a week at most) but I need this out. im not even crying or anxious. idk what this means. am I gay? do I even love my bf? have I fallen out of love? I feel like im lying as I write this but im not. I know that. but what if all the feelings I talked about having for him are all past before realizing its comphet even tho its not, idk. im exhausted mentally",OCD

589,"Hello. I'm 14f...i have pOCD... This is by far one of the worst times in my life. I am stuck in a constant.........cycle. I wake up with the deepest sense of dread and pain. My thoughts follow me into my sleep. Every waking moment is painful. 

My OCD tells me that everything I do must mean I'm a pedophile.. I have never felt this much pain and stress in my life.. At least not to a degree I could admit. I find it so hard to fully convey what this feels like but I just know that it is painful. No matter what I do..

My brain finds unique ways to make me feel terrible and stressed out. I like someone my age? I'm a pedophile. I like someone way older than me? I'm somehow still a pedophile and I must like them because they look ""young"" . I drink something? I must be imagining something sick and pedophilic while I'm doing it. I'm staring at something? Must be pretending it's a kid. I like any kind of art? Must be a pedophile. I'm sleeping and I have a disgusting dream? Must be my true desires. I must be a pedophile. 
I pick up my niece? Must be a pedophile. Looking at art?? Must be a pedophile because somehow someway my brain distorts everything I see and deducts it to being a kid. I'm taking a shower and washing up? Must be a pedophile and imagining it's not my own hands on me. 


I am constantly suffering....the amount of intrusive thoughts that flood my mind. They disgust me. 
I write out all these thoughts and debunk them but once I finally feel relief.. I find something new to stress over. I'm so tired. I can't get therapy. I can't be medicated. I am paralyzed. There's a constant voice in my head telling me everything I do must make me a pedophile. Everything I think.. Must make me a pedophile and I get constant intrusive images and then the groinal responses disgust me and cause me so much anxiety. I want all of this to stop. I've already been through so much trauma in life.. Why am I still suffering?. ",OCD
590,"Is it just me or did living with ocd and the longer I’ve had it (going on a year) I’ve learned to live with it, I wouldn’t say it “got better” but I can finally live my life like I used to but still battle at times. Is this normal?",OCD
591,"This isn’t the first time someone has floated the idea of me having OCD, even my therapist said I fit the criteria, but in the past I’ve had doctors say my anxious thoughts only seem like OCD because of my autism, so I’m feeling really confused.

I was out on abilify, not specifically for OCD but this is my second week on it and I’m feeling better. I’m not sure if I’ll ever be officially diagnosed with it, I can delete my post if it’s upsetting, but living like this is exhausting.

I’m constantly worried about everything, and then the these worries built into panic attacks. It’s mostly financial or about something happening to loved ones, or being a bad person, or not being a real person, the list goes on

The more I read about peoples experiences with OCD, the more I feel that I might have it, and it would feel a lot better to put a word to it. At the same time I just have an echoing thought that it’s just my autism that makes life hard and there’s no way it could be both

So yeah. I’m just…sad and confused. Not because of the concept of having ocd, but because I’m not sure my parents would take me seriously if I did have it. My parents think nothing is wrong with me. Even though I was diagnosed with Asperger’s as a kid, they pretend like it never happened because I did well in school and got through college

592,"TW: non-descriptive imagined violence involving a baby 

Throughout my life, the signs have always been there, but when I gave birth 8 months ago they ramped up EXPONENTIALLY. I got diagnosed with OCD 4mo postpartum. I was taking extreme measurements to avoid contamination & the thought of him getting HSV1 or another virus became an obsession. 

With all that aside, any time I held him in public I could imagine dropping him on his head and just other really horrible things. Now that I have a diagnosis I can sort of shove away the irrational fears, but every once in a while they pop into my mind and I’m shocked at what I can think of. 

Today, I was doing laundry in the basement and my mind just kept replaying a very graphic imagine of him falling down the stairs (the rules say no details) I can imagine the sounds perfectly.

598,"In all of my years, I've wasted so much time worrying about countless obsessions (you name it, I've had it). I've been utterly convinced that I've had AIDS, ALS, many different cancers, schizophrenia (the list goes on). I've had bouts of religious OCD, harm OCD, POCD, etc. So much of my life has been spent in fear of the ""what ifs,"" and convinced that my deepest fears were true. 

The irony is that three months ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. Actual cancer. Not imagined. I've lost much of my life so deep in worry. Days that I could have been more present with my husband and kids, and days that I could have gone outside and done something with my healthy, able body. Now many of my days are spent at home, sick from the chemo pumping through my veins.

I have hope that my cancer can be cured. I am thankful for that. But I will now forever have to live with the fear of recurrence (anywhere between 10-30% chance) and if that happens, it will likely be terminal. This fear isn't imagined like all my worries of the past. It's real. It will be difficult adjusting to this knowledge.

Where do I go from here? I'm determined not to waste any more time worried about the ""what ifs."" I want to be here, to be present, and to not waste any more of my precious life. I wish that I could apply this logic to my OCD and that it would disappear, but I know it's not that simple. Reaching out to someone for help is step one.

599,"Hi, all. I don't have ocd but my bf has severe ocd that's been taking a very large toll on him (and kind of me by proxy) for as long as I've known him, but it seems like it is getting much worse lately. We live together and when he does feel okay, everything is great, but it seems like those times can be few and far between sometimes.

 He's been unemployed for awhile now, and he pretty much stays home all day ruminating. He likes to see new places and has traveled a lot in the past, but did say that traveling for long periods of time makes him stressed and triggered, so I thought it would be fun to book us a (short) trip a few months ago, which is coming up. He seemed so excited about it until a week ago and then he started saying he doesn't know if he wants to go because he's not sure if he can handle it. And I'm not trying to be a baby about potentially missing our trip, but I would be lying if I didn't say I wouldn't be very disappointed about it.

If it was just this one incident then I would be more inclined to be gracious about it, and honestly I still am, but I don't know if I can take the up and down much longer. It is so hard living like this and I feel selfish for saying that when I know he goes through hell every day. I love him more than I've ever loved anyone and I just want him to be ok. 

I'm really not trying to judge him for how he deals with the shitty hand he was dealt, but I haven't been seeing him trying to do anything to make it better. He really needs some help and I would totally support  him through it, but he's so scared to take the first step. I don't really know how to phrase asking him to seek help without it sounding like an ultimatum (although to be honest, it might be one).

I’ve realized that I’m stuck in a cycle of gathering too many resources, all neatly organized in an almost obsessive way, but I haven’t completed any of them. When I look at what I’ve truly learned, it’s just the beginnings of many resources without finishing any of them.

Whenever I try to focus on a single resource and commit to it, I quickly feel frustrated, especially when the content feels too basic or when I don’t feel like I’m making substantial progress.

Now, I feel exhausted, unsettled, and overwhelmed. I don’t know how to organize what I’ve done so far, and I’m scared that I won’t achieve anything meaningful if this continues.

I have never felt so controlled by something in my life. I have came so far with the help of meds and therapy but living in NYC, I am constantly facing my fears everyday and it becomes overwhelming when no one around me truly understands what I’m going through. Yea, I just feeling so alone in this. I have a really big fear of HIV/ BLOOD and yesterday I saw a needle next to a homeless man on the ground and it sent me spiraling. If I didn’t see things like that, semi often, I really feel like I wouldn’t be as anxious. Feeling like I should move but my whole life is here.

613,"I recently went through a stressful time between a long term break up and job change which seemed to have caused memory brain fog, derealization and bad bad dissociation. Instead of my OCD giving me intrusive thoughts like the usual.. since I’m so used to that it decided to completely shut up and latch on the recent dissociation that I experienced telling me I’m probably schizophrenic or that I’ll be stuck in this daze forever. Now I’m constantly checking how I feel or searching around on schizophrenia to where I’m even more not paying attention to the real world and what’s in front of me.

614,"I’ll start by saying I have pretty bad OCD. Been in treatment for months. I developed some tics in the last couple of years after I had a massive OCD relapse. Had tics on and off in childhood and in times in my life when my OCD has flared up.

Lately I’ve been feeling like I have some bizarre hybrid or I can’t pick out what are tics and what is OCD. Like if I think of a tic and I’m like “what if I had this [insert specific tic here] or did this tic that would suck.” And then it’s like I obsess over the likelihood that it could happen and then I end up feeling like I am in fact developing said tic. 

I’m like has my OCD latched onto tics as an obsession or are my obsessions giving me urges? Just can’t tease it apart. 

Anyone else?",OCD

My main symptom is that it feels like my mind goes a mile a minute. There will be like 4 things going on at once: I’ll have an argument in my brain w myself, I’ll be counting 1-5 over and over, I’ll have a monologue going on where I announce the things I’m doing as I do them, while another voice gives opinions, and ALWAYS A SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD. ALWAYS. 

I’ll wake up in the middle of the night several times and the song will pick back up where it left off. Like there isn’t a single moment when it’s not like this. It’s not even a mildly annoying thing but a serious disturbance.

623,"One thing that OCD taught me is that 'thoughts' are not just the words you say to yourself. They're also unspoken 'feelings' ... perhaps the best analogy is that 'ominous' or 'creeped out' feeling you can get. How any of you have had such weird feelings but they start to be about yourself? I think that's a common OCD theme or experience

But even deeper than that, how about physical sensations or perceptions ... again not words or even feelings but strange perceptions like 'things seem different like I'm seeing reality like a movie' 

I find these aspects fascinating ... our consciousness goes way beyond the  words in our heads and when these feelings and perceptions 'play tricks on us' it's very unsettling",OCD
624,"So, I just qant to vent about it, because it's affecting me lately. I think OCD doesn't make sense and it bothers me that it can affect me. The thoughts are disturbing, but, the ""rational"" parte of me knows nothing bad will gonna happen, and I rationally know how I feel about certain things, but it still makes me question things, as if I didn't know the truth. It's like having a annoying person inside my head, trying to fight with me and my certainties. I'm feeling some discomfort  right now.

628,"My girlfriend (26F) and I (30M) have been together for over five years, living in a new city with our two cats. We’ve built a life together, but now she feels it’s best to end things because my health issues—mental and physical—have drained us both.

When we moved here, we didn’t make new friends or have family nearby, so it’s been just us 24/7 for years. The pandemic made it even more isolating, and while we used to thrive in our bubble, it’s taken a toll. For a while, we’d get separation anxiety when apart, and I eventually became codependent without realizing it.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety, OCD, depression, and physical issues like chronic gerd, which left me feeling stuck and depressed. I didn’t have healthcare until recently, so I couldn’t address these problems sooner. I’ve finally started taking steps to get better—starting therapy this week—and wanted to try couples therapy or at least wait until I’m medicated to see if I can start feeling better and change my ways.

She still loves me, but she feels drained and thinks our relationship has run its course. Her mom encouraged her to break up, comparing it to her own divorce, and now my girlfriend feels it’s best to split.

I understand where she’s coming from, but it’s hard because I feel like I’m finally on the right track, and it’s too late. We’re still living together for now while figuring things out, but I can’t help feeling like this isn’t how it’s supposed to end. Any advice would mean a lot.",OCD
629,"Hi! 

I recently took my 5 year old to her pediatrician for a symptoms which I found through research were related to OCD. The dr referred me to a psych doctor for a more in depth evaluation. 

It started about 2 months ago, more excessive handwashing with not only herself but with me as well, I bought her a spray bottle to fill with water because that seems to ease the anxiety of germs. It's gotten to the point to where we're leaving in the morning and she's having a full on meltdown due to her jacket touching her bag and the bag is ""dirty"" or her clothes became ""dirty"" if she walks outside. She also didn't like the phone or iPad touching anything or else that would be deemed dirty as well and it would have to be wiped down excessively. I asked her what she thinks will happen if she touches these things and she says if the dirt gets on her she's gonna die. It's gotten to the point where we went out to the museum and she through a hugeeee fit because she didn't want anyone within a foot of her. This was difficult bc it was a public space and strangers had to sit in a pretty close proximity. I haven't heard much from the school other than she fixates on making things ""perfect."" Which I also see at home when doing homework with her, it takes longer than usually because she needs it to be perfect and it seems like just the thought of perfection is tiring and wearing her down. She's told me other intrusive thoughts as well, she's also had some of these thoughts when she was younger and I brought this up with her peds dr as well. It's hard to address safety and sanitary issues because she tends to get terrible thoughts about it. Another example, her good friend has a jello allergy and she didn't even want to put the jello (her favorite snack) in the cart at the store because she was afraid her friend would pass or break out, she then started doing these nervous snaps that she typically does to self sooth. I talked with her about it and ended up having to hide the jello under something to get it into the house. At home she was just fine eating it so I'm not sure if it's just certain times or if certain locations triggering these reactions.  

Other than this are there any tips on questions or points to address during this appointment, I want to make sure I get her the proper help because I'm so saddened seeing her become lost in these thoughts and it's like losing a child in a way, which I feel like sounds dramatic but it's gotten to the point where we're kind of walking on egg shells and I just want to help her manage this to go back to her normal lifestyle as best as we can.

633,"So for anyone, and I hope that is everyone who reads this, who has successfully managed to claim even the smallest wins towards breaking the cycle - I wonder if you can relate to this scenario.

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you're starting to be very well aware of how OCD is operating within you and you've been successful in not feeding it with compulsions, gaining more control over your life back and starting to be more present - perhaps not even being the first time in your life - but then a fear of forgetting about what you have to do to get to this point in case you fall back again hits you?

It feels like I'm particularly terrified of forgetting about OCD. Even though when I did, it was bliss. I've managed to break the cycle before, more than once, in my life and I've had extended periods where I was lucky enough to be able to just live my life and completely forget about OCD because it was so far in the background. It was starved of compulsions. And that's the thing - it scares me that one day, as proven before, something will arise in my brain, triggering the loop, and I have to work my through it again. As a result, I take notes after notes after notes. Sticky notes, journaling, digital reminders. And then that itself turns into a compulsion and overwhelms me. I'm scared of forgetting what I have to do when it decides to come back one day - and ironically, THIS is what's in my way of ""full"" recovery right now. And it seems so much more urgent when it is something that has actually happened before and I don't want to re-experience it.

When I was a teenager (I'm 27M now) I had no idea what all of this was. It usually happened when I would dive into activities that wouldn't even allow me for a second to think. For me it was competitive games, rhythm games, making music. OCD would then starve, mostly in addition to more social interaction. Now, I've learnt my fair bit through several particularly difficult periods and it feels like I'm very aware of when it's sneaking back in.

Part of me wants to put ""just one sticky note"" somewhere that reminds of me this. A note that tells me there is no threat, I am safe, I must not feed it. But I know a day or two will pass and that piece of reassurance won't feel ""just right"" anymore and in no time it'll be 10 sticky notes. You know the drill.

But I feel like overcoming it would mean exactly not doing that. It feels like I've gone through all the levels, more than once, used up all my ressources and now I've reached the final boss - or is it just the same? Trusting myself that I will be okay, even without any sort of reminders about this fear.

Last week my spouse noticed how the days have been getting better for me - it's crazy how aware someone you live with can be of your OCD. I had no idea. It's like day and night for them, and it seems sometimes they are more aware that I'm going through compulsions than I am myself. Maybe I'm very lucky. I've had some wins, for sure, and the days have become easier, more care free, more in control, simply because I haven't been feeding it, recently.

But I might be in the same situation right now. Is it just the same thing? It's not as severe as other times, but it is there. Being too afraid to let go and ride out the anxiety that comes after? I feel like I might be unaware that this is a common experience people with OCD feel and I'm just looking for reassurance again. Even though I feel so aware of it.

How do you perceive/experience this?

647,"So basically just a little summary since Dec 23 2024 I took a 30mg edible(not sure exactly but pretty sure it was a high dose)
And had a horrible horrible panic attack along with extreme DP/DR and racing thoughts, it was extremely traumatizing

Anyway fast forward to now the past month I’ve experienced extreme intrusive thoughts 24/7 along with existential thoughts, DP/DR on and off, very very high anxiety which has traumatized me af and I’m still dealing with it but been managing very well so far.
This all started from January 6th where I had a panic attack at school and I thought this was  side effect from drugs but apparently since wayyyyy before I ever even got introduced to the occasional drug (past 2.5 years) I’ve had very strong signs of OCD I never even noticed or thought was just normal.

My signs so far are:
Intrusive thoughts, Nail picking and constant checking, recounting and doubting then recounting things, having an overly order sense of things when it comes to objects, extreme paranoia and rituals with numbers(example would be me stopping the microwave time at a certain number because the number would mean how much money I wish for or manifest for myself.. yeah I know it’s weird) for 2 years straight I had a extreme fear of pencil lead and would clean literally everything that touched it and would panic if it touched my hair or clothes which I’d have to wash. I used to have horrible thoughts thinking I’d hurt others or do horrible things even though I wouldn’t ever do that, I need a lot of reassurance on certain stressors and I keep asking again cause it’s like my brain refreshes comfort. And THE TICS like when I was 6-8 I cleared my throat over and over again a day just to repeatedly do it and I repeat random phrases or words out of no where. 

AND THE BIGGEST SIGN 24/7 is I have a tendency to pick my fingernails til they bleed allllllll the time and if one side is unpicked and the other is picked I will pick it til it’s even, even if it hurts and bleeds. 

Just a note I have had a lot of childhood trauma and had a bit of drug/alcohol use throughout early-mid teens which I didn’t know can contribute a lot

Im very much sure the THC edible induced it heavily as my best friend who has OCD pretty much mirrors everything I’ve been experiencing and told me a lot of helpful info to possibly get checked out. ",OCD

649,"Long post. TL;DR:
>I have always been underweight and skipping meels and getting gag-reflexes and not being able to finish food etc. But everyone just chalked it up to me being a picky eater. But an even today made me realize just how MUCH I have been obsessing over food. The thing was that it’s always been part of daily life for me, so I never even reflected on how bad it was, or how far from normal it was. But now with this new realization perhaps I can get help. Since I’ve tried dietists but they didn’t know how to help it. They just said ”you need veggies and protein and three meals a day”. But now that I know I can seek out specifically OCD catered care.

end of TL;DR.

I think it finally clicked for me now.

Not that I am self diagnosing. I don’t have formal OCD diagnosis.

But it makes so much more sense.

What makes sense is that:

•	⁠no dietist has known what to do with me
•	⁠I don’t fit the criteria for any eating disorder. The issue is not my weight or body dysmorphia
•	⁠I kind of fit the arfid trope of ”picky eating/eating is a super hard task”. My therapist called it ”selective eating disorder”. But again the issue is mostly that I NEED to know what is in my food. I even come off as rude sometimes because when someone else serves me I will inspect it tediously and be like: ”what is that? what is that? what are those spots? Why is it mushy? what are the green things”

But the thing is today I think it kind of clicked for me. It’s not an eating disorder but a brain disorder. Kind of ”food ocd” if I would label it.

Not purely contamination but mostly.

But what is weird is that it’s not all the time. Sometimes I am distracted enough to be able to eat normally. But sometimes my tummy screams of hunger but I can’t eat.

Like today.

I made myself some semolina porridge and when it was done it had black spots in it. When I was little we found bugs in the flour in out house and it was gross as HELL. So immediatly my mind went to bug eggs.

Now granted this might be warranted I guess. It might be bug eggs idk🤷‍♀️  But it has been in an AIRTIGHT container, so most logical explanation is that it’s some bits of the corn stalk or something.

Idk. Anyways so now I’m not gonna eat it and throw it all out. Even though all I ate today was a frozen pizza and I am hungry as well.

I had three eggs at home at least, so I made some scrambled eggs. I feel that they have a less chance of being contaminated with something so I can eat that at least.

But you know… semolina was for long one of my safe foods. one of the things I COULD eat. And then today fucking ruined it.

I can’t even go to a fucking mcDonalds because you hear all those horror stories of them not being hygienic.

Now I can’t make semolina porridge.

I can’t eat store bought bread because it sits out in the open and can have bacteria on it/have hair in it.

I read the ingredient label of EVERY food I buy at the grocery store. Buying 5 things literally can take me 30 minutes.

I didn’t eat noodles for 6 months one time because they looked too much like worms.

I stopped eating nutella and cup noodles because the ingredients state that they contain palm oil.

One time I threw away a vanilla bun because of all the internet jokes about vanilla/frosting actully being ”semen”.

etc etc

so semolina porridge was one of my safe foods because it was JUST milk and semoline flour. I thought it had a low chance of being contaminated.

Or homemade bread I guess. But that took me too much energy so I never do it.

And idk. As I said it’s not all the time. I guess tomorrow it will be gone if I am hungry enough and I can buy myself something to eat.

But I just want to be able to eat. Normally.

I don’t even eat sushi because I am scared that the raw fish will have parasites in it and I’m terrified of getting infected by a parasite.

A bakery that selled to grocery stores in my country recently was on the news for having RATS and rat spillings, and other unhygienic stuff. I have BOUGHT from their brand.

It just seems to me that I can’t TRUST any food.

Like even ”uncontaminated” semolina flour or normal flour WILL have bits of bugs in it. (they are ground up, there is a maximum allowed of course, but all flour will inadvertedly have some ground up bugs in it).

I haven’t eaten wild raspberries for years, because sometimes they have larvae inside them. I have eaten storebought sometimes but only after carefully inspecting each and every one I put inside my mouth. Meanwhile other people just eat them normally without a care.

I don’t know where to seek help. I feel it’s getting serious. Though probably it’s not acute, since I have had it forever and yet been fine. But right now I just want to cry because my tummy is screaming of hunger but I can’t eat. I have convinced myself that the semoline flour has bug eggs. (even though it had been on the shelf for months in an airtight container and not once have I seen any movement).

And the thing is that I already have a therapist. BUT she is treating my cptsd.

So do I seek out another therapist? I wouldn’t know how to get in contact with an ocd specialist.

A dietist I already tried but as I said they were not helpful at all.

I think I will contact my primary doctor tomorrow and tell them about this new discovery that I think that it’s tied to ocd.

I have always known I was underweight. I often feel near fainting, and quite often feel dizzy and skip meals.

But I always thought (and everyone always told me) that it was just picky eatin/selective eating disorder.

But todays incident with the flower kind of opened my eyes. I saw the big pattern.

I don’t think it’s normal for a kid to be scared of POOP particles in their chocolate because there was a news story about a factory 5 countries away where a factory worker hadn’t washed their hands properly.

I don’t think it’s normal to spend 40 minutes each grocery store run (I go omce every 2 days, for ONE person, family shopping I would understand if it takes more time).

I don’t think it’s normal to not eat noodles because they ”look like worms”.

So yeah… I think I figured it out now. I just wonder what took me so long. I think it is the fact that everyone else told me it was ”normal”. No one ever caught on to it. They all just said ”stop being silly”. Or ”that is rude. Why are you asking me about the food? don’t you trust me?”. or ”you have to start eating more”. Etc.

That’s all they told me. They never understood that it was much deeper than that.

I mean maybe I have my hopes way too high. But imagine if someone could fix me. Imagine if I were able to eat a steak again. Imaginw if I were able to eat three meal a day again.",OCD
650,I have ocd about evil and devil and I feel like possessed and not sure if this is ocd. I have been fighting it but I'm trying not to but now it's as if my mind is not working. Whatever I want to do my brain tries to do the opposite. Like if I want to try and write my brain will try and stop me writing and stop me remembering or being able to think and I'm failing my university. I can't even do basic things like talk to people without it trying to make me act in a weird way. ,OCD
651,"What medications is everyone one that helps their ocd? I’ve been on Prozac 60mg for about 7 years now and just started Wellbutrin XL 150mg about a month ago now. I feel like nothing is working, my depression is down but I’m so exhausted by the thoughts. (I have talked to my psychiatrist)

652,"my brother has been showing worsening symptoms of contamination ocd. when he was in high school, he was referred by his teacher to a therapist who diagnosed him with anxiety and depression. maybe a couple of months after diagnosis, he made the decision to stop his medications and therapy. he did seem happier. sometime during college, he grew more anxious again and quit driving his car out of fear of road ragers. but ever since the covid pandemic, he's been more concerned about insects, dirt, germs, and trash. he used to just be religiously applying hand sanitizer, but now it's developed into washing his hands for hours. he wouldn't want other people to go into his room and he would wipe down all of the surfaces. 

yesterday, i noticed my brother was hovering near my bedroom door. when i asked him what's up, he apologized and asked me if i wore my outside shoes inside the house. i told him no (our household doesn't outside shoes inside), but i asked why he was still thinking about that if i had just come back home hours ago. he said, ""i don't know... something's wrong with me"" and walked off. :( my heart broke into a million pieces. i couldn't even respond to him directly after that so i went to my mom to let her know how severe this situation is and we should act now before it gets worse. his brain tells him that the contaminated object is touching him and it alters his perception of what's really happening. that's why he was asking me about my outside shoes. he needed constant reassurance from me and my mom that what happened really happened. 

he is refusing therapy and treatment even though he identified his compulsions as something wrong. i offered that i can drive him myself to appointments and accompany him, but he is caught up on the costs that may accumulate. his therapy sessions in high school costed $100 out of pocket each session. maybe we can try helping him out at home? baby steps like reducing the amount of time he needs for washing his hands? i would do anything for my brother. i guess this post is directed towards any family members of those with ocd. if you have ocd, is there anything that you would like family members to know? or is there anything you wish you knew before getting diagnosed? thank you in advance for your advice and support!",OCD

655,"Greetings to all, I have recently been diagnosed with OCD by my psychiatrist, as the title suggests. While it is certainly a challenging condition to manage, I have found a sense of closure in that I am discovering a bit more about myself, and have the opportunity now to properly address my long undefined condition. However, one aspect that continues to confound me is maintaining a sense of organization. At times, I am so consumed by ruminating thoughts, compulsions, or become overly fixated on distracting myself, that it results in missed assignments or arriving late to meetings. I have also found myself overlooking simple tasks such as brushing my teeth, cleaning my room, and doing my laundry; all of which is deeply concerning to me. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!

657,"My mom wants me to try more natural remedies to my OCD. I'm on medication right now, and it works decently, but the entire rest of my family has their medications too, so it gets really expensive between all of us, and she wants all of us to try and handle things more naturally. 

But I'm scared. My OCD still isn't amazing (I haven't even started ERP yet), but it's an improvement from how awful it was before. And I'm afraid that if I stop the medicine, it will get really bad again. 

I don't trust natural remedies that much - I believe they can be helpful, but they feel far too unreliable. Which I suppose unnatural medication is as well. But I just don't feel like it will work as well. Or that it will take a lot of everything to even get me to an okay point, and that sounds exhausting. I feel like I'll be spending all my time and energy on all these essential oils and candles and meditation and healthy eating and crap and none of it will work.

But I still want to try, because everyone else has already said they will too. And my dad says I can't be dependent on meds for forever. So, does anyone have any advice on how to handle it naturally, and have it actually work?",OCD

662,"Does anyone else with contamination OCD not actually struggle with fear of germs, but a need to “perfectly” avoid contaminants at all times, otherwise you go through the feelings of being “dirty” and “impure”? 

I genuinely have 0 fear of germs as a threat. It’s why I’m able to touch doorknobs or cook with dishes that have had mold in them at one point (so long as they’re properly bleached first and the mold hasn’t infested into cracks). But I struggle a lot with playing “contamination” olympics. In the sense, at one point I used to be okay with my skirt touching the floors of bathrooms because I didn’t see any other way to use restrooms in a skirt, and all of that changed when I saw a reddit post where everyone talked about how they *had* to hike skirts up so it wouldn’t touch the “dirty floor”, and I instantly felt horrible because I hadn’t known this form of contamination avoidance even existed, so that’s what I started doing. 

It’s gotten to the point where I feel as though I have to spend enormous amounts of time choreographing every move - ie carefully removing my purse from a chair or my phone from my pocket so it doesn’t touch the floor. Keeping my grocery bags on the ground as few times as possible. Even today, I was feeling terrible about myself because I put on a thick jacket in the restroom with “dirty hands” (where I’d even put huge globs of hand sanitizer on my “contaminated fingers”), and it occurred to me that I could have balled my hand up into a fist and put it through the armhole of the jacket, therefore reducing/eliminating contamination. Its hard to know what to do based on “social norms” either. Apparently there’s people who don’t sit on their furniture in “outside clothes” and use napkins to touch every knob (I’m pretty comfortable touching all knobs, including bathroom door knobs). Once my brain discovers these new methods of contamination avoidance, my mind conjures disgusting images of how I’ve spread contaminants everywhere (ie put on my swimsuit after using the bathroom, now there’s urine/feces on my swimsuit, could have been avoided if I was careful about putting the swimsuit back on with a “clean” hand. Touched the bottom of my dirty backpack with my feet, now there’s other people’s germs on my clean feet. Could have been avoided if I “quarantined” my backpack and was very careful around that “quarantine zone”. Touched a stain on the airplane front seat with my head, this could have been avoided if I kept my head leaned back against my own seat for the entire flight). I’m super nostalgic of a time when I didn’t contemplate *any* of these methods of contamination - none of this was an issue for me in college. I can keep doing ERPs but they make me feel so physically nauseous that I have to take breaks, and there’s no way for me to “forget” these chains of transmission even after I stop being bothered by them.

664,"I had a really bad problem with stalking my ex in the beginning of my relationship. I eventually told my boyfriend and he made me promise that I wouldn’t do it again. I was doing so good for months, never even thought about it. I started to get curious again though so instead of stalking my ex, I stalked a mutual friend we had in common. I might have just stalked her to stalk her but I think I hoped to see my ex and was probably searching for it. I also stalk my exe ex who I was obsessed with during our relationship. I didn’t stalk the mutual friend all that much but I did stalk my exs ex quite often. I felt this weird obsession with her and wanted to see what she posted. I think at first I was just curious if she posted my ex, but then it was more about just wanting to see her posts. I feel completely over my ex, that’s longggg gone and I love my partner very much, I just get curious sometimes. I’m starting to feel horrible about it and I feel like I NEED to confess.

All this is pretty good and logical advice I think but it's like I try and tell myself these things as a form of reassurance over and over but it just makes things way worse. I also feel like I am alway pushing towards finding a sense of relief for myself and struggle to accept that if I ruminate more about things it's not going to lead to some magic eureka moment where I can suddenly beat ocd and live the rest of my life in bliss like some type of spiritual guru.

666,"I'm going through a particularly rough OCD cycle at the moment, with a focus on breathing which causes me to hyperventilate. I know that I will feel fine if I don't focus on it, but I can't stop focusing on it, and I feel like I'm choking which causes me to panic and monitor my breathing even more. I haven't slept at all last night because every time I almost fell asleep I would feel like I lost my breath and wake up hyperventilating. Every time I manage to stop focusing on it, an intrusive thought pops up that says; what if you think about it again?! And so it goes on. 

What I know from therapy is that the fear of this theme is causing it to stick around. I also know that I'm trying to solve my issue by googling remedies or breathing exercises which is all just part of the compulsion to solve it. I know rationally that nothing can happen if I hyperventilate, and I think my fear is currently more focused on ""what if I can never stop thinking about this"".

670,"I have had OCD since childhood and have gotten relatively good at controlling my obsessions so that they don't impact my everyday life. Lately, I've had a much larger amount of financial responsibility coupled with some other circumstances and I've found money has become something I obsess about constantly. It is like my mind never shuts off from worrying about bills, deadlines, credit, etc and since I am in a transitional period right now and am not making good money, I don't have much to deal with the root causes currently. When I have a bill, I literally cannot stop thinking about it, sometimes to the point I shut down and can't function. The moment I pay it I start thinking about the next, obsessing over my credit score, checking my accounts, etc. It's very distressing and the worse my financial situation gets, the worse I obsess and the worse the situation becomes. When I give myself days off (I work multiple jobs and typically don't have much time off) I'll find myself just worrying and obsessing over money the entire time. It's become so much that I've now relapsed, have zero expendable money or emergency fund, and am getting extremely terrified.

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with financial obsessions? Any tips? ",OCD

I'm a relationship OCD/contamination/health OCD girly. After a year of fighting my rOCD I'm finally squaring up to my health OCD this week.

It's a good thing too. Ever since I got COVID for the second time this past June, I've been feral. Every ache, sniffle, snorp and itch is a sign she has returned. My mom has bronchitis (not COVID, tested thrice and is on antibiotics and steroids) and my anxious booty was stuck to my bed for three days despite knowing she was cool. Bro. I'm tired man. I'm ready to beat this bitch. I literally sat on my crusty floor for five hours because my mom made my bed. While I was at my fiancé's. Guys she made it three full ass days before I came home. My bed was fine bro. I'm tired man.

672,"For me, it provides routine and distraction. I also like that I get a clear set of tasks and instruction. This wasn't always the case, only in college.

Does anyone else experience this? ",OCD
673,"Does anyone else just randomly feel repulsed by things you like or something you see? Like my favorite blanket in the house: suddenly I look at it I gag, sees something when I’m walking: gag, my friend shows a picture of his bird you guessed it: gag.

 It drives me crazy because I love my blanket and I love my friend’s bird but I just can’t interact with it for a while because I get so sick just looking at them. ",OCD
674,"For the past 3 months I've been dealing with an obsession of mine in which I associate thoughts together, usually it's a thought I do not like (or an intrusive thought) with some random thought that appeared in my mind at the time.

I've been able to conquer and master what to do about this, that being not minding the associations and letting them happen, accepting the uncertainty that they might bring... Basically giving them the same ERP treatment as someone would do with intrusive thoughts (Btw I would really like to know the compulsion in this case, is it showing that you are unconfortable with the association and not wanting it to happen?)

  
Now, these past few days, I've finally broken a certain compulsion I did. (switching my strategy to winning against this Association OCD when I felt they weren't being effective) However, a new compulsion of mine has shown up in its place, one where I constantly reassure myself that the ""not minding the associations"" strategy will work everytime I do a new association or just when I feel the doubt creeping up on me. The worst about this compulsion is that once I actually have an association, I feel lost on what to do about it (this fact about not knowing what to do about it giving me a huge wave of anxiety), but once I actually try to remember what to do, I end up doing a compulsion of the reassurance OCD.

I've tried to tackle this by not doing anything about it in the first place, not caring about myself being ""lost"" on what to do and just sitting with the anxiety (as that is not minding about the problem, since I'm not doing anything about it) but sometimes that just makes my brain question stuff like ""Isn't what you're doing  avoiding the fear? That's a compulsion""



Currently, I feel like I need guidance on how to solve this the ERP way, do I just accept the uncertainty of the whole situation and sit with the anxiety without minding and doing nothing about anything? That seems like the best course of action to me but my brain also questions this method thoroughly, as it does with any other method...

  
Some more information I should include: I'm still a teen so who decides if and how should I seek professional help are my parents. Currently, I'm having sessions with a standard therapist but they're not doing a great job to help with OCD (instead of ERP, they rely on reassurance to stop compulsions from happening, not realizing those are also compulsions). I've begged for my parents to find an OCD specialist to help me but they insist that ""No such thing exists"". On the bright side, they'll have me pay a visit to a psychiatrist and get me prescribed to meds.

Sorry for the long post, tried to put as much info as I could here to make everything clear + help some other person in the same situation as mine (if what I said is hopefully helpful). Any help is appreciated.",OCD

**My HOCD (First theme)-**

In October 2024 my HOCD started which was the worst period of my life i remember laying in bed and not wanting to do anything because of the anxiety.What was even worse was going out with my friend.But as soon as i heard what HOCD is i realized all of this shit my brain has been saying wasnt true so i spent all my night trying to learn how to deal with all this and recover.

I found Ali Greymond on youtube and everything that she said helped me.What was weird is i got POCD for a day but i quickly realized its the OCD trying to use a new weapon so i shut that off and I learned how to just sit with the thoughts and anxiety and it was a amazing my attraction to women came back, the old me came back ,happiness came back.

I was what i think nearlly at the finish line with recovery but it all went to downhill in december because of TOCD 



**My TOCD (plus HOCD)**

So while i was dealing with HOCD and trying to read about it and i heard of TOCD and honestly i didnt care too much because i knew even before TOCD that im not trans.

But one day im watching Speed and Kai doing the fortnite stream and then Speed says something about men not wearing socks in shoes cause we are men lol and it gave me a anxious feeling because he said that and my theme changed in a second with my brain saying 'why tf did you feel anxious are you trans' and 'what if your trans' and even more thoughts 

This theme is hard for me because of how much it separates you from yourself like i instantly didnt feel like a man, didnt care about my beard and before i was trying to make it grow longer ,couldnt look at men and women and myself in the mirror, couldnt do mma cause i felt weak and not like me and women attraction went away and thats why HOCD is back

But i realized it was just like HOCD so i looked up what is this TOCD and i found this guy on youtube explaining what it is and instanly felt hope and used what Ali Greymond told me to do and it did start working 

I didnt care anymore i felt like the old me again i started trying to get my beard longer again doing mma and women attraction came back 

until again a whole reset 





**TOCD Right now**

once i stopped reacting to the 'what if' thoughts my ocd is hitting me with 'you are' thoughts and im struggling with them for 4 days now 

Everything has went bad again i dont feel like my self again and cant look at men and women without feeling cringe or hearing someone refer to me as he or him 

These thoughts feel real. I constanly have this feeling like im in denial and i want to transition now but i know i dont want too and another scary thought for me is ill be alone in the future and not have a beutiful wife and kids like i dreamed of all my life and eventually transition

i even started to read TOCD stories again just to make sure im not trans and i can go back to feeling like myself again so i really need help to get me through this again





**Some of my question to help me get back to recovering**

Is this again TOCD trying a new method of using a fake want feeling.

Do i have sit with these real feelings and 'you are' thoughts and ignore them like how i did before.

Does my whole story even sound like OCD because i cant get a therapsit.

And the most important question for me will i be able to start a family and have a wife because right now TOCD and HOCD is hitting me hard Ive lost hope again so i feel like i wont be able to in the future.

**Thank you if you read all of this**

**And i hope someone can answer these question and give me tips and ways to get through what i think is another scary TOCD recovery stage.**",OCD
680,"I love my mom but with the way she converses feels chaotic to me. She talks about topics all over the place and sitting with her too long when she’s talking becomes a trigger for me. I get severely uncomfortable because the conversation isn’t organized. She’s not always precise with pronouns, and when I don’t understand exactly what she’s saying, then I get frustrated. She doesn’t always repeat/clarify when I ask bc she doesn’t appreciate being clarified/corrected all the time (like a normal person). She’ll continue going on with talking but it’s hard for me to get a word in because the topic changes so much, and then I get frustrated and just shut down. she’s very unpredictable with what she will say too (like I call to talk about one topic and then she jumps to something dark/scary that I didn’t anticipate).  I’m fearful we just can’t have 1x1 conversations :( how do I tell her this without hurting her feelings? How do I cope?

I got defensive but honestly didn’t really argue or get mad. Teared up but didn’t cry. 

I don’t know how much she threw away. She says nothing but, when talking about my money I kept in an empty iPhone box (SO SHE WOULDNT TAKE IT LOL— she used to snoop when I was younger so I just always did that), said “You’re lucky I didn’t throw it away before I opened it,” implying she did throw other stuff away.

I have so many diaries. My diary was on my bookcase bed. 

I just can’t even type out all the details but now all I have is a twin mattress on the floor. She’s picking out a new bed and dresser and I’m just like damn…… really???

It’s weird because as much as I feel violated and frustrated (I NEVER leave the house. And the one time I do this happens???) I feel RELIEVED because it’s so CLEAN now.

I don’t know what I’m looking for. I just felt like getting opinions ",OCD

687,"since the election and all the conversations about privacy and how my data gets used, I have been a mess. Anyone else?

i have always had very very lowkey fixations about data, social media and digital footprints, but it has never been a real problem or my main OCD trigger. Most of it has just been the standard real-event style worrying about my browsing history or something I may have done as a kid with unrestricted internet access (thanks mum). 

I didn’t actually connect the dots until today, but I think proliferation in conversations and media about data and social media (particularly tiktok) post-election has just made me hyper aware of my lack of control and understanding in tech and privacy. I’ve always known nothing ever truly is private, but now I can’t escape the reminders. I’m literally not even American.

for reference, I managed to convince myself today my employers are somehow inside every personal device I’ve ever had and can see everything I’ve ever done ever and that I’m going to lose my job, and I justified this on the basis that I don’t understand M365 privacy policies so I will never be able to guarantee for sure they can’t.

My head is full of “he’s leaving me, he’s going to break up with me, he’s not my forever” etc. I *know* I need to lean into the uncertainty. He can not text back, he has his own life. And whether he wants to break up or not is not up to me, it’s out of my head. It’s uncertain and regardless of what happens, I will handle it. Well. I can’t eat.

Now whenever I can’t get any rest from my ocd I sit in the an and e waiting room and read or catch up on work.

690,"A bit of a long post, I cannot tell if this is allowed, I'm half asleep and crying. I just need to be able to breathe freely now. 

I sleep in the same bed as my grandmother, on opposite ends due to some things. She doesn't sleep w underwear on and recently I found her with it just having the blanket covering it.

I already would hold my breath basically for as long as I could until I fell asleep because she kept burping and yawning through the night, but now I cannot go a second with free inhalation of air because I HATE the thought of cooch air or smell. I thought a water bottle was dirty because of this and her feet accidentally touching it, I cant touch her blanket or her side of the bed, I can't do anything.

I tried washing the water bottle yesterday but ended up crying and still couldn't drink from it. I made this post because I opened a new one yesterday and I'm convinced it got ruined by the air in my room and that there's nasty particles on it... And I HATE IT. I can't drink water, even from the kitchen if I think the air is bad or smelly. I can't go a second without holding my breath.

This is like, a brand new development too. It wasn't so bad earlier last year, up to September, when I just went spiralling and my screenshotting excessively came back, and they were so gross that it just kept getting worse and worse. I could ignore the burping and whatever at first but now I literally cannot breathe, drink water, use the bathroom freely??

 I'm 15. I can't get help or tell them to stop being gross so I can calm down and be less affected, they'll just think I'm insane and keep doing it and it just. Makes it. Worse. The more they burp and groan and do stuff, the worse it gets. They changed the foodwaste thing near the sink from a small container that gets empitied out daily to a big one that isn't, and holds the food for longer and generally stinks when you open it, and now I can't drink water if someone opens it. I ignored it at first, but the worse my mental state gets, the more tiny things affect me and the more they do it the less I can ignore it.",OCD

I’ve been out of work since Thursday and I feel like maybe that’s just too much time for me to do nothing with. I feel really frustrated with this because a two years ago I would have soaked this up but here I am trying to watch the dang football game & I feel like my teeth have moved (they have not). Why? Why must my brain try to ruin everything for me?! It was starting to get difficult again on Friday with all my intrusive thoughts. It feels like my brain is trying to pick everything I’m scared of like “oh, this one isn’t working?? Let’s go for the teeth 👹” “oh you don’t care about the teeth.. hm.. well guess what? All your hair is gonna fall out” LOL

693,"Does anyone else associate periods of their life with interests and things they frequently wore? I can also see each different month as a different specific color, song, tv show, or t-shirt. Each year, I try to recreate that exact feeling or environment. For example, the past 3 Thanksgivings in a row, I've worn the same cardigan, because it's what I wore to the first one and I have deep nostalgia for that era in my life. Nothing in particular stood out as making that phase positive, but I know I wore that cardigan and listened to the 1975 a lot, so now every year around Thanksgiving I make myself listen to the 1975, even if I don't really want to. I'll even recreate specific events, in order, wearing the same thing, to try and achieve the feeling I felt the first time around. For example, 3 years ago, on Summer vacation, my mom and I went to a small town and watched a movie. Then we went to three stores and a bookshop on our way back to the beach house. The following year, I made sure we did the exact same thing, in the same order, and I wore the same clothing. My Mom had no idea I orchestrated that lol. Sometimes I get a pang or sense of urgency to try and recreate the past. Specifically, I view summer 2022 as my peak, and will obsessively scroll through every photo I took, every tiktok I posted, my playlists, and my snapchat memories to try and relive it. It is honestly consuming and exhausting. I have the same exact photo of a painting on my phone from 4 years in a row, because I felt like I needed to retake the photo. When I think about a lot of these past phases, I get an overwhelming sadness and feeling of depression. I feel desperate to try and go back, because things in my life are pretty shitty right now. However, it's not like this was some perfect and peaceful time in my life-- there were definitely things I struggled with back then, just not as severely as I do now. I think most of all I have a deep longing to return to the relationships I had with my family members in summer 2022. Things were a lot better than they are now, and I feel like if I repeat the same things, my family will get along the same way they did then. Does anyone else get urges to do this, and how can I combat it? I feel like I'm incapable of living in the moment and am always trying to create or recreate a memory to obsess over. ",OCD

705,"So basically, I have contamination OCD, and it's been getting pretty bad so I'm thinking about going on meds for it. But the thing is, from what I've seen all they do is kinda of lessen or make the thoughts and compulsions a bit quieter, without actually erasing them. Now this would be a great help if I was all mentally buffed up and ready to fight my OCD tooth and nail, but honestly I'm really not. Despite it seriously affecting my quality of life and restricting my freedom, I'm not that motivated to get rid of it, nor do I despise it that much. I'm just numb to the routines at this point, even if they are getting longer and longer. I think another problem lies in the fact that my family's responses to my OCD is much, much worse than the OCD itself, which makes me blame my unhappiness and depression on them first rather than my OCD. That's a whole other thing though, so anyway returning to the point, what I'm wondering is if meds and quieting the thoughts will even help much if I'm so unmotivated that I end up giving in anyway, even if I have a chance to resist?

To get from the bathroom to the kitchen for example (I live in a bungalow) can take up to half an hour.

Even everyday tasks such as getting dressed ends up being a ritual. I have to do everything very slowly so as to ensure I’m doing it properly/ thoroughly. It’s driving me to breaking point. I can’t even walk into my house or go out for a walk without checking and looking closely at things. This is on top of having severe anxiety and major depression. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at breaking point. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t considered suicide. 
I’m on medication for ocd/ anxiety and I’ve had counselling/ been in therapy in the recent past but I can’t say it’s really helped. I know it’s partly because I’m autistic so I guess it’s in my DNA to have all these routines/ rituals. 

I guess my question is does anyone else have such debilitating OCD as this? Do you have any strategies or ways of coping with it so it’s not as stressful or distressing and more bearable/ manageable?

I want to start off by saying I would really just appreciate some kindhearted support on this matter. I have literally been living with this (pretty much alone) for the past year because I’m too ashamed and afraid to talk to people besides my close family. I have actually recently realized that this is very much an OCD thing through talking to one very trusted friend (an OCD therapist). So anyway, this is a request to please be kind and gentle with me because I fear that malignant feedback may be a huge detriment to me right now. I am looking for understanding and advice. 

For the past year, I have been obsessing over making comparisons between myself and others on the basis of their ability to travel and / or to live in other countries. I am a very well traveled individual, I am also very young and not quite financially stable yet, and have the rest of my life to do things like this, and see so many places. However, my mind is on a constant loop about how I am lesser than others who are having these experiences in the current moment when I am not (and living in my original home country still, which makes me somehow feel like a failure even though to others, I have a beautiful life that is so full). Sometimes my brain tells me such horrible things about myself in comparison to these other people that I actually start to lose vision of what reality is and I begin to think that I am living this horrible, endlessly failed life. I don’t quite know what I’m looking for here, I think maybe I’m looking for some understanding or perhaps some tools that may be able to help me get this constant daily rumination in check. Even medication suggestions are welcome.

I can’t concentrate on the book without my mind racing, intrusive thoughts popping in, some random song on repeat, and just 9 other tabs open in my brain.  I find myself having to reread the same paragraph multiple times just to get the meaning of it.

728,"I've been dealing with intrusive dreams about cheating for a few weeks now. I have also been using an app similar to Omegle (just text, no video) where you can chat with other people. I would chat casually when I'm bored for a while but one person tried to get flirty with me (they gave literally no info and neither did i - with the most generic name possible) and I disconnected immediately, feeling disgusted and like I cheated or invited cheating. It made me extremely uncomfortable and has now triggered me immensely. I also don't have heath insurance or a job at the moment so I have a lot of free time to ruminate. :(

730,"I have autism and ADHD (diagnosed with both) and I have taken ADHD medication for nearly a year. For two or three years now, it’s hard to say when it really started, I have had particular things in my flat that I compulsively check. These things are that my bathroom and living room lights are switched off after I have switched them off, checking my heating is turned off after I have turned it off, checking my kitchen door is closed, and checking my mobile phone is charging before I go to sleep. The amount I check these things is unnecessary but my brain only feels comfortable when I have checked until it feels ‘right.’ Interestingly, on the first ADHD stimulant I ever tried, this checking became worse to the extent I first considered OCD. I changed medication and it has been back to normal since, but the checking is the same, it just doesn’t have huge mental toll on me that I had on my first ADHD stimulant medication. Does this sound like I have OCD? My checking does not involve counting which is one reason I have not known if I have OCD.",OCD

At the beginning of the month I was afraid of catching rabies and I avoided all cats and was scared of bats and then I somehow made it past this and I thought this week finally it seems like my life is getting good again. And then I found a pouch with scalpel we use for dissecting cadavers in medical school during anatomy and now I am extremely afraid what if I accidentally was dissecting a cadaver with prions and what if now it’s everywhere, even though I didn’t dissect a brain.

735,"One of my main problems is that I tend, at an extreme level, to avoid ideas, interests or any actions that I believe have been influenced even a little (even by suspicion) by someone or something that I hate very much.

For example, let's suppose that I hate Pablo very much.  So if I am going to play a car game on PS5 and it comes to mind that Pablo plays that same game on PS5, I will become anxious and it is certain that I will avoid playing that game perhaps until the idea of ​​playing it comes to my mind. for other reasons that do not involve Paul. If I learned about the game because Pablo plays it, it is very certain that I will never play it no matter how much I like the game.

I would also avoid learning any new ideas that come from him. Continuing with the example, if Paul gives advice about something, no matter how useful it may be, I will try not to adopt that advice, or anything similar to it, otherwise I become anxious. If I am thinking about an important question and something associated with Paul comes to mind, even if it is just a thought about him, I will get anxious and try to dismiss the idea.  This makes you avoid thinking about important questions for fear that they will become ""contaminated.""

736,"I have OCD and have had an issue with confession compulsions historically. Although I still always struggle with whether it is a compulsion or actually something that I should divulge to make “amends”, I guess?

I currently live with my girlfriend of about 3 years (hopefully soon to be engaged) in an apartment building. I noticed recently that someone from my past has moved into the building, that I was somewhat sexually involved with.

Long story short she was very manipulative and had sexual relationships with both me and my brother (my brother first, and then me - although I had no idea about their relationship when I met her and she approached me / asked for my number).

I dont want to go into detail but we did not actually have sex, just fooled around a bit and made out.

I don’t hate her but seeing her brings up very negative old thoughts. Now I have this odd feeling to tell my girlfriend about the situation but I don’t know if thats just my compulsions.

I feel like it would make her uneasy knowing there is someone I had a past with for no real reason - as there is not any reason for concern. I also hate the idea of explaining the whole background, given the kind of gross nature of it all.

And that's nowhere as bad as the terrible, no good, horrible, very bad feeling after i wash dishes post lunch/dinner and the sweat and sticky feeling starts accumulating on my fingers and palms, even if im holding something as simple as my tab or a book.

and alongside that, i do my haircare rituals which all involve handling oil and other liquid stuff that makes my hands feel gross, and in turn makes me go wash my hands asap (and at night, when i take a bath straight before bed, all the moisturizing and body oiling makes this a repeat performance of this whole comedy show). As i type, im constantly wiping my hands on my shirt because GROSS DAMP FEELING. i literally just washed my hands 10 minutes ago, but i just finished spraying my scalp with hair serum and typing is just adding to the feeling. And I can't put on the anti perspirant lotion yet because im going to take a bath now, so i feel like im in a hell of my own making-which means hand washing time!!! For the 7th time!!!!!!!!

im 22 never had a bf and two years ago i got a thought that i never had a bf or the reason i get scared when things get serious in that way its cuz im secretly a lesbian, and i literally went to the bathroom and puked.

i do think i had an episode before when i was 16 but it was very short and bc  of a comment a friend made about me getting a lesbian haircut, it was like a long bob but whatever...and the fact that i watched lesbian and solo female porn (which i hear its normal but i feel like for me its not)

i went two months obsessing and thinking of a million scenarios to see if i felt good but anytime i would just panic and feel sick and cry, i then told my mom and hearing myself say that what if im a lesbian out loud just felt wrong and not me at all so i was calm for a bit...until  it started again. and just after that i was googling and i found a post on quora about hocd and i felt soo relieved and good like i discovered fire or something. i got deep into it and i realized that this is exactly how i feel and thats great this is over...but it never left...just living with this. plus other stuff appeard like groinals and salivation when seeing breasts and asses idk... and i never see people talk about this either..

  
i still never had any interaction and now i feel like everytime i find a guys attractive its me just forcing it to force myself not to be a lesbian... my head can make everything i do to seem like i do it just too deny my sexuality..

in these tw years i had months and weeks at a time where i felt super ok and like this is leaving me alone but then i would see something and would start all over...like the fact that i was pretty tom boyish for a fwe months or the lesbian porn or i will think people look at me and think i look like lesbian or that some gay girl has a crush on me and i will get triggered.

754,"I currently have several diagnoses that I’m unsuccessfully trying to manage. They include epilepsy, chronic migraines, severe OCD, and adhd (with SPD). It is not uncommon for these to be comorbid, but they are notoriously difficult to treat concurrently.

A lot of medications used to manage OCD are in the SSRI family. I cannot take those, because they have all interacted with my epilepsy medication. Some of my compulsions manifest as physical pain, nonepileptic seizures, and other neurological symptoms. Psychologists and psychiatrists repeatedly tell me that I need to work with neurologists for treatment, and neurologists tell me they can only help manage the epileptic seizures and migraines. 

Has anyone had successful treatment with epilepsy and OCD? ",OCD

# Strength Through Obsession 

While OCD can be a challenge, it often brings with it an intense focus, attention to detail, and perseverance, which have helped these individuals achieve extraordinary success in their fields. This reinforces the idea that OCD does not diminish intellectual potential and can even enhance productivity when channeled positively.

Here are some **examples of famous figures in science** who reportedly struggled with OCD or exhibited obsessive-compulsive traits. These individuals demonstrate that OCD, while challenging, can coexist with groundbreaking achievements in the scientific domain.

# 1. Isaac Newton 

* **Field:** Physics, mathematics, and astronomy.
* **OCD Traits:** Newton is often described as obsessively meticulous and highly detail-oriented, to the point of being consumed by his studies and work. He kept extensive, precise notes on everything he studied and was known to repeat his experiments compulsively to ensure accuracy.
* **Impact:** His obsessive drive and perfectionism contributed to foundational scientific works like the laws of motion and universal gravitation.

# 2. Charles Darwin 

* **Field:** Naturalist and evolutionary biologist.
* **OCD Traits:** Darwin reportedly had obsessive tendencies, including repeated checking of his symptoms due to health anxieties and meticulous recording of his observations. His ruminative thinking patterns may have been tied to OCD-like behaviors.
* **Impact:** Darwin’s compulsive attention to detail allowed him to collect exhaustive evidence for his theory of evolution, which revolutionized biology.

# 3. Nikola Tesla 

* **Field:** Inventor, electrical engineering, and physics.
* **OCD Traits:** Tesla was known for his compulsive behaviors, including an obsession with the number three, repetitive handwashing, and avoidance of physical contact with others.
* **Impact:** His attention to detail and fixation on perfection helped him innovate technologies like alternating current (AC) electricity and wireless communication.

# 4. Albert Einstein 

* **Field:** Physics and theoretical science.
* **OCD Traits:** While not officially diagnosed, Einstein exhibited signs of obsessive behaviors, such as wearing the same clothes to simplify decisions and focusing intently on problems to the exclusion of everything else. His rituals around daily routines hint at OCD-like tendencies.
* **Impact:** His ability to focus obsessively on theoretical problems led to transformative discoveries, such as the theory of relativity.

# 5. Leonardo da Vinci

* **Field:** Polymath (science, engineering, and art).
* **OCD Traits:** Da Vinci exhibited perfectionist tendencies and was known to obsessively revise his works, which often delayed their completion. He also kept detailed notebooks, documenting his thoughts and observations in an almost compulsive manner.
* **Impact:** His relentless curiosity and attention to detail resulted in pioneering studies in anatomy, engineering, and the natural world.

# 6. Paul Erdős 

* **Field:** Mathematics.
* **OCD Traits:** Erdős had compulsive behaviors, such as a need to structure his daily life rigidly and obsessively focusing on solving mathematical problems. He also exhibited traits of dependency on routines.
* **Impact:** His obsessive passion for mathematics made him one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, contributing to number theory, combinatorics, and probability.

# 7. John Forbes Nash Jr. 

* **Field:** Mathematics and economics.
* **OCD Traits:** Although better known for his struggles with schizophrenia, Nash also exhibited obsessive thinking patterns and compulsive behaviors that may overlap with OCD tendencies.
* **Impact:** His groundbreaking work in game theory earned him a Nobel Prize in Economics and reshaped the field of strategic decision-making.

# 8. Thomas Jefferson 

* **Field:** Statesman, polymath, and inventor.
* **OCD Traits:** Jefferson demonstrated an obsessive need for order and symmetry, documented by his meticulous record-keeping and designing architectural plans with perfect proportions.
* **Impact:** His compulsive attention to detail was reflected in his scientific inventions and the drafting of foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence.

# 9. Glenn Gould 

* **Field:** Musician and theorist, known for mathematical precision in music.
* **OCD Traits:** Though better known as a musician, Gould’s obsessive-compulsive tendencies also influenced his mathematical and scientific approach to understanding acoustics and sound.
* **Impact:** His obsessive attention to detail contributed to his revolutionary interpretations of classical music, grounded in mathematical precision.

# 10. Thomas Edison 

* **Field:** Inventor and entrepreneur.
* **OCD Traits:** Edison exhibited obsessive behaviors, including relentless experimentation and an inability to let go of ideas until he achieved success.
* **Impact:** His persistence led to the development of the light bulb, phonograph, and motion picture camera, among other inventions.

761,"15F 
so I have alot of issues with memory which developed due to trauma so there's alot of memory gaps which leaves so much more room to ruminate.

there's a few real events my brain says that i SA'd someone.

the first one I was around 7 or 8 with my friend (idk if that's the exact ages) and I told her we should show our genitalia (behind and front) on camera and post it because i saw someone else do it and it would make us viral (i didn't see anything like that my intrtnrt was unrestricted and that was around the age I saw weird YouTube fetish videos but at the same time I didn't even understand sex yet or atleast I think so
 and those videos had nothing to do with what we did.

and we did this a few more times but never posted it from what I remember..i think we just recorded it on my iPad and laughed about it?? I don't remember if we laughed or not


 i found butts funny at that age so maybe that's why. I was also a compulsive liar when I was young bit i  have no clue why I'd say I saw it which makes me feel like I HAD bad intentions or something
  and the police came to my friend and I house .

we are still friends today and we even made jokes that we can't tell anyone about that. but I'm worried I Sexually assaulted her or coerced her. 

another was when I was maybe 10 or 11 this was during the lockdown  anni had this friend who was like 2 years younger. i also forced him to play these paranormal games with me irl like the ones I saw and for one it was red door yellow door. where u have to put your head in someone's lap and they like rub your head and u chant or something.
I asked him and he said he didn't wanna do rather the game or me lay my head on his lap?? but I just wanted to play it and kept asking  him (idk what i said but i remember us attempting it.) i dont think I ended up laying in hd lap or anything.  but I'm scared that was sexual assault and coercion too. i didnt want to do anything sexual but I still ignored a boundary and I'm worried  we haven't talked for like 2 years mostly bc his dad is in another country and we drifted apart 

another was when I had bad POCD instrusivw thoughts when babysitting my neighbours daughter who's around 4 well she more just came into my room. i kept opening my.arm for hug out of awkwardness but she kept sitting on my lap. i pushed her off every time she did but my.brain is saying I touched her innapropriately. but I remember just awkwardly sitting there. but idk if this is a false memory that i touched her hair or something
then she made me carry her on my shoulders and fall on the bed with her because she said her cousins did that. i was really uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. but I did like babysitting her and I was trying to ignore the thoughts . then my mom came In to changer her into some of my like toddler clothes  and I thought she was asking me to change her so o tried to take the clothes and then I just said ""oh I thought they were for me"" because I thought saying that i thoughts she wanted me to change her was predatory 
my mom also made her pasta and I told her to go to my room. and i at some point asked my mom to close the door (idk why to be honest.) i also said at some point ""you don't know how to hug haha. every time I ask u just sit on my lap!"" to her.
but now I'm worried she will grow up thinking I tried to sexually assault her or I'm scared I did and just don't remember or didn't realise. because I was trying really hard to ignore the insrruiabe thoughts and thoughts telling me I was taking advantage of her
I've avoided her since then out of fear I will accidentally do that to her. and because being around kids triggers me alot.

I'm so scared. of all of these scenarios and now I'm overthinking all of them.
I have gone through COSCA myself but I won't het into it because I feel like I'm trying to justify my actions but all of thos is overwhelming me and I feel like I have to kill myself. i know I won't but I feel like the only way yo escape these worries amongst others is to die

the things stopping me from that is fear and worry I'm only trying to escape my wrongs by killing myself or something.

I really needed to vent this and i would appreciate honest advice and ways to deal with this or just if u feel similar and wanna share your STORY (not for reassurance but for some advice and ways to know what.to do when thinking this)

764,"Hi everyone, this is my first time ever I visit this community.

I’m a 25-year-old male. Since I was 16 I started experiencing different OCD symptoms. Thankfully, I’ve managed to overcome most of them, but one remains: an intense fear of death. The thoughts of death and burial weigh heavily on my heart, and I worry about them constantly.

A key pattern I’ve noticed is that these symptoms mainly occur during the winter season, almost every year, lasting for 2-3 months. During these episodes, I lose the ability to enjoy things that usually make me happy. I wake up and go to sleep feeling depressed and anxious.

I understand that seeing a psychiatrist is a common recommendation, but I have a major concern: I am in the medical field and currently live in a third-world country. I’m in the middle of applying for jobs, and I fear that if my employer discovers I’m taking psychiatric medication, I could be rejected from the job (they get access to my medical conditions…)

767,"Hi friends. Gonna try to keep this short so pardon the disjointed writing style pls. 

I was diagnosed with the old ADD/OCD diagnosis as a teenager. 

I've been seeing my psychiatrist for almost two years now. 

Medications I have prescribed that could be helping with OCD symptoms in any way: 

* Seroquel 50mg/morning 200mg/evening
* Ritalin 20mg morning and evening (I haven't taken this since December...)
* Lorazepam 1mg as needed (once a week or less, I do not want any dependency) 
* Clonidine 0.1mg as needed (I haven't actually touched these in months)
* Hydroxyzine Pamoate 50mg morning and evening 
* Propranolol 10mg morning and evening

Current OCD struggles:

* **Dermatillomania/excoriation disorder:** I have made progress on this issue but just suffered a horrific relapse which has left my face looking like a meth addict's
* **Romantic:** I suffer from paranoid delusions about my partner and also struggle with very unreasonable wishes for events which just don't happen in reality. I know that's confusing so I'll give an example: I was (am?) obsessed with this ""romantic"" notion of getting married only weeks/months after getting together with the person you know you want to be with forever. My partner and I have a great relationship, and he's given me a promise ring to try to help assuage this obsessive fear, but I still regularly have breakdowns about it, and I hate it. Last night I was flipping out about it and this morning I claimed that ""when he does propose I will say no because he's broken my heart waiting too long"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ 
* Sexual: I am in a committed monogamous relationship but my brain will not freaking stop giving me sexual thoughts about others, including people I'm not attracted to in any way, like my plump, twinky gay psychiatrist. Every time I am in the room with him I imagine us kissing and it makes my hr spike so bad and I get all sweaty 😔 same with randos in public like in stores... I round a corner and nearly collide with some stinky smelly hobo type and my brain is instantly like ""wouldn't he love it if you grabbed his dick? 😏"" no brain STFU right now
* Health/Medical: I have a number of actual health problems, which went undiagnosed until adulthood. I have a heart condition and a major joint disability and growing up I was told it was all anxiety, which I internalized. Now I feel intensely guilty about having medical problems, I ruminate about treatments but don't do them (like I bought a moist heat eye mask for my dry eye problem, I think about it 20x a day and use it once every three days at best. Bought a tens machine for my knotted muscles, think about it often, never use it) 

I've lost interest in typing all this up but let me assure you, OCD is ruining my life. 

I want to call my psychiatrist tomorrow and ask for more help but I don't know what to say...",OCD
768,"Has anyone here ever had repeated obsessive thoughts that are something like (for example)  - ""I know I SAY I'm a leftist, but I'm secretly a right-winger"", - or something to this effect? 

I spend a lot of time on social media, and I watch a lot of political content and debates, and I think this hasn't proven to be very good for my OCD. I know the political and social beliefs that I personally hold, but due to the current political climate and the pressure to conform to other people's ideology, it's like my brain is constantly trying to trick me into thinking that I am somehow the complete opposite of what I really am. This bleeds into everything else in my life as well. It's like my brain ties my political beliefs directly to my morality as a human being.

My problem is that I can't tell what is r-ocd and what isn't. And, being long distance, I can't always read his body language or facial expression, especially when we text. As soon as there's a response to something that I'm not expecting or something doesn't go the way that I think it ""should"" I start to spin out worried that I'm stuck in a failing relationship and that my partner and I are doomed. (Dramatic, I know, but when has OCD ever been chill?) It being my first relationship, I get worried that I'm missing signs that things aren't going well or that I'll do something wrong because I don't know better.  

So I was wondering if any of y'all have experienced this? Or have any tips for managing r-ocd? If it helps at all my partner has adhd.

Or now I’m worried I have a brain tumor and am now suddenly feeling tired even after sleeping all night and even napping. As well as nausea. Is this something others experience too? Is it something like the placebo effect? Its happened so many times to me. Even as a child. If I pretended to be sick to not go to school, I would actually start feeling sick later that day.

If i dont do something this way or if i do something the ocd doesnt want me to do ill feel like something something is hindering my breathing and i almost felt light headed once. i felt like i was breathing the ""bad"" way that makes my thoughts worse

Once i undid the action, my breathing went back to normal.",OCD
780,"Just to start this off: want to make it clear I’m NOT looking for reassurance. I have gotten temporarily banned from here before for this (for valid reasons, as it actually helped me—without seeking reassurance here, I was able to sit with the thoughts some more and eventually get to a much healthier mindset than I was before) so I just want to clarify this.

That being said, while keeping this as vague as possible. I have a real event that has been bothering me for some time. It is understandably morally gray and also a sexual event involving someone I would NOT ever want to involve in a sexual event, hence my incredible worry. Essentially I would get strong groinals from OCD, they felt good, and in my event I remember moving away from this person and then realizing I need to learn to sit with the groinals and moving back. Again, no need to comment on what you think about this—it’s just backstory for my later question. I have talked to a therapist about my main real event and she’s reassured me that I’m fine, I am not an abuser or even close to one, and is helping me do ERP. I am still guilty for it but I don’t feel ridiculous waves of guilt anymore.

However, since I did this real event, I remember I was thinking (a couple weeks back) about other times I might have done this real event. Because I’ve done OCD therapy before, I know not to “search” my memories and add details to them, like “what if I did that?”, because it always leads to false memories and fucks up my mind, so to speak. However, I wasn’t actively searching for a memory. I was just wondering if I had one. And I think a little later (I don’t remember if I was actively thinking about these memories or if this memory came out of the blue), I remembered another event similar to this one. Obviously, my event involves touching people (in normal ways, like leaning on them, brushing against them, etc.), but I recognize that I don’t want to touch someone for the SOLE purpose of doing ERP, or like just to sit with the groinals, as it feels like I’m going against my morals. Whereas I’m more okay with if I get a groinal while touching someone, I can just sit with it; it feels less intrusive. Less like I’m using them. 

I remember vaguely thinking about putting my leg on someone and getting groinals. I didn’t question the memory. I also felt at the time like my original intent was to touch them to test the groinals. What gets me is that I didn’t question this memory, just accepted it as true, and also didn’t feel worried or scared about it. Sometimes I get false memories and I know they’re false because of the fact that I’m hit with such a large wave of anxiety. However here I just… was okay with it. I also, over the course of the next few days, got more memories like these. I don’t think I was actively searching for them; however I did know that I probably had memories like this, and so maybe subconsciously my mind plucked them out?

A couple days later I thought about this more and started, for lack of a better word, tweaking. Analyzing the memory, searching it for clues, etc. After a couple days, I remember I got this sudden feeling of—wait, something if wrong with this memory. I dismissed it and kept searching. Then one day I was like hmm, I don’t even think this WAS me doing it for the groinals, I think I just put my leg on her for fun. I was okay. Then a couple days later I started searching again, and I remembered me being tentative about putting my leg on her. Bad. Then I was like wait, I don’t think I did it to TEST, I think I wanted to put my leg on her, was scared of it since it might start the groinals, and did it anyway. Not to test, but just being normal. I don’t know the truth here. I’m trying to accept uncertainty.

I was okay with that when one day I was testing I guess by pretending to put my leg on someone. Suddenly my attention went right to my groin; and I was hit with this feeling of, I guess, familiarity? And I recognized that I’d put my leg on her to test. I was again scared. Then I realized a little later that this feeling of familiarity was likely a false memory. Then I kept testing, and it just felt so real. I definitely did it, I think. But I started thinking about other scenarios and I think I could have just meshed a whole bunch of different sensations and memories together. Except the other day, I was thinking about it and it felt so real, I jsut accepted it as truth. But after a couple days of doing that, now I try to remember it or get that sense of familiarity back, and I just… don’t get it? Like it doesn’t come to me. 

I guess I’m just confused. It feels very real; and yes, false memories can feel real, but this is just strange. How exactly does the mind concoct these? And while I can tell some details are off because I can’t place these memories in time or context (a telltale sign of false memories), it feels very much like muscle memory; like I remember doing this, even if my mind doesn’t. I am, once again, NOT looking for reassurance. Don’t tell me if you think my memories are real or not. What I am looking for is: why exactly does this happen, and how do I learn to deal with it? I know searching my memories won’t lead to certainty. But I can’t just dismiss what I did. I know how to say “maybe I did it, maybe I didn’t”, but I don’t know how to say “despite the fact that every muscle in my body is telling me this is true, there’s a chance I didn’t”. 

What do yall with false memories do? What’s the move? Essentially, while the memory is less strong now, I can’t help but assign meaning to the fact that just two days ago I KNEW it was real. How do you deal with that? I will be talking to my therapist about it but unfortunately she’s out of town for a bit so it’ll be a while. ",OCD
781,"Hello, I 21 {M} went through a lot of traumatic things being a stupid child online   
{11 to 17 years old} and constantly making bad descisions of talking to a lot of adults online sexually which I've made a lot of posts about before, different times and scenarions almost weekly of me interacting with adults sexually and me being a child, a lot of them knew I was a child.

784,"My redmi note 5 pro which had become dead in 2022, was lying like this, now since this was my favorite phone, I thought I should get it repaired, it would be of some use, so I took it to the local repair shop, the shopkeeper said that its emmc is dead, so he changed it, I took the mobile to the same shopkeeper in 2022 also, at that time he had said the same thing, but he also said that the photos etc. will not be able to come back, so I did not get it repaired, 

now he changed both the emmc and the cpu, after the first boot I saw that there were some dialed numbers and a couple of apps like vidmate and dream 11, he said that the imei number changes when the emmc is changed, so I said is there any problem with this?  He said no and he even checked and showed that the IMEI status was clean, he said that he does not do all such wrong things which can bring down his credit in the market, I gave him 2000 rupees through Google pay because the display had also been replaced, 

now the phone is working fine since last 3-4 days but I am very scared thinking what if something illegal has happened through this IMEI? What if the police come to my house? Or what if someone takes my photos from my dead EMMC and starts blackmailing me?  Since I checked the IMEI on many apps and sites including official government sites and the status was showing clean everywhere, but I don't know why I am overthinking since last 3-4 days, 

since that repair shop is very old and that day I had taken my friend also for repair, now my mind is telling me to go to his shop, turn on the audio or the spy camera and talk to him and somehow make him say that he has changed it and your emmc was dead, but I am feeling this compulsion which I don't want to do, what should I do now?",OCD

I just basically force some air through it. It's not really all that noticeable, even though it does interrupt my talking sometimes (which is very obnoxious).

But what I think I've also noticed is that it tends to hurt my ears after a while. I'm not 100% sure of it, but I seem to have developed a form of tinnitus. And I think, though I'm not sure, that it increases during periods where I do the nose thing a lot.

i've also read and heard from others that a part of truly handling intrusive thoughts is to let the thought sit with you and pass. how does one... actually do this? i feel the need to fight it everytime, trying to let it be feels like leaving an itch unscratched. could anyone provide any examples pertaining to relationship ocd and moral ocd?

something i've also done is that i'll analyze the question when i'm feeling calmer, write down my arguments in a document (i'll use previous memories and times when i felt okay), and everytime an intrusive thought occurs, i'll cite the document as a way for it to be quiet (literally ""i already addressed this, so shut up""). is this something good to continue doing, or is it still a form of reassurance (which i understand is not good for handling this)?

at the moment, seeking out medication and therapy doesn't seem to be a easy option, so i'm just trying to do as much as i can before pursuing these options. if anyone has any more good methods, please let me know. i am trying to deal with this problem swiftly and not have it continue to affect myself and the people in my life. i love them so much.",OCD

I washed my hands afterward, but I had already touched my hair with hands that touched down there and maybe even got something on them (sorry for this).

I'm an idiot, but anyway, I didn't have time to wash my hair, and I was trying to keep calm and not overthink. Then I touched my hair on accident later and touched my laptop, phone, headphones, etc., without realizing what I had done.

This isn't a normal way to view these things, is it? It's beyond stressful. It's killing me. I just need reassurance that that's not how things work when spreading stuff. I mean, it's not like it's anything I can see. It just feels dirty to me. But you can't live life like this. That's not how normal people view particles, germs, bacteria, or whatever the right word is. What do you call them and how does it actually work—I'm so confused. How can I enjoy my trip without viewing my items and bag as being dirty and having pee particles on them? I just can't live with that and focus. And I got fun things coming up; I just don't wanna be thinking of that. Of course, I could clean them, but I don't have all the necessary detergents and cleaners. I also don't wanna go down that rabbit hole. I just want to be normal again. I need someone to talk to. I feel so weird and disgusting.

I should add I probably have OCD, but I can't fix that right now. I also just wanna know how this stuff works. I need advice. Some real-life facts or science. The OCD is more so me being scared of regretting and telling myself I'm not overthinking. But I would've liked to know what was normal and what I should do regardless of OCD cause I've always been a clean person. I would've liked to know anyway. I know I need therapy for my OCD, but that's not the advice I'm seeking. I just can't call one up right now. I just need some reassurance and to know the solution. I don't think cleaning all my stuff over nothing and something I've probably done before is the solution. I mean, isn't everything covered in dirty stuff constantly? I mean, my bathroom floor is gross, too, I don't clean everything my socks have touched. But it feels different cause it's pee. I just don't know. I also just wanna get some sleep. But I'm scared I should clean my stuff, and I'll regret not doing it. But I don't have much time. I feel like I'm overthinking how this stuff spreads and thinking I've made a huge mistake. But I'm also scared if I don't do something about it, then I'm an idiot because maybe I'm right, and I obviously should clean what I've touched now. This wasn't a problem before. I just wanna be normal again. I'd really appreciate it if I didn't get shamed, and some help would be greatly appreciated, too :) I've gotten better with a lot of OCD things on my own, but this one I can't shake because I literally don't know if I'm doing something/what I'm doing right or wrong, OCD or not",OCD
800,I don't know why this formication issue is getting worse in the past 2-3 days. I keep having dreams of insects and I'm over it. If you deal with this how do you cope? Any supplements you take for it? I feel it much less when I'm on my adderall but it wears off and the sensations get worse.,OCD
801,"Hi there. A year and some change ago, I realized my CBT wasn't helping me anymore. I reached out to a psychiatrist and together we identified that I had OCD, I started seeing an OCD specialist. A long the way the OCD specialist wanted me to get tested with ADHD. My psychiatrist told me that with my penchant for ""just right"" symptoms, I should get tested for Autism too.

I'm still waiting on the results, they said it would take 4 weeks, but I was told by the test giver that she fully expects my results to come back positive. I guess I don't know what to do?",OCD
802,"hi, just wanted to know if anybody else feels this way. i’m not asking for any reassurance but just to know people have been through similar (if not the same) thing and any advice on how to navigate it.

i graduated uni in july last year and haven’t managed to get a job. my ocd completely made me spiral tonight and has forced me to believe that the reason im not getting a job is because there’s something on the internet about me or whatever. or that someone is saying stuff.

i’m just wondering if anyone has any tips on how to deal with this? i know realistically it’s just because the job market is a mess and hard to navigate but i got rejected from two part time jobs unrelated to my degree too so i think im just feeling extra anxious.

Anyway, I've got the internet conspiring with my ocd and flagging up horrible illnesses (that I HAVEN'T been looking up), illnesses that progress and kill within a few years.  I know the treatment now is to accept that these may be the case, but I keep ruminating about it.  Looking for certainty that I haven't got those.

804,"First, I'm sorry for the ones who have struggled with OCD as I did for years; I can relate to the pain and sufferings you have, but I don't want to recall that painful past. I would like to bring the light - The light at the end of the tunnel of this journey where we enjoy our cognitive and intellectual freedom we are supposed to have and enjoy.

Below is the mitigation method I would like to share, hoping it can also help people who share similar patterns as mine.

\- Developing a new Semantic web to mitigate OCD symptoms

1. Method :

Before jumping to details, let me get straight to the point : my mitigation method was to create a NEW semantic web in the neurons of brain. Our brain is wired in a way that constitutes OCD traits - constant fixed thoughts that are not emotionally, realistically, philosophically and academically meaningful. 

How to escape from and even get rid of those thoughts ? 

If your thoughts are expressed in English, learn a new language and use the new language to think and to process the input data from your environment. When your OCD go full-blown, you can do real-time translation of English into the new language, forcing your brain to focus on another thing.

2. Why new semantic web works ?

Naturally, the moment we were born, our brain has started creating a new semantic web containing symbols, characters, logos and image around us. Unfortunately, we don't know what goes wrong with those brain neurons, some of which constantly force us into one or a few ""thinking threads"" just like a post thread. 

How to deal with those unwanted thoughts ? By creating a new semantic web

We create thinking threads (like new reddit post) in a new language. Your brain will be so busy handling the meanings of words, collocations, expressions, syntax and grammar of the new language, giving your brain no time to dwell on obsessive thoughts in your mother tongue. This was how I handled a full-blown OCD after I figured out that thinking in English could help mitigate obsessive thoughts in Chinese - my mother tongue. 

3. To clarify, if you google  ""semantic web"", it shows semantic web is a concept proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1998 regarding world wide web, but that's not precisely what I mean. The semantic web I refer to is like this : [3D semantic web in ChatGPT](https://imgur.com/a/GIaORA4)",OCD
805,"As the title says - 

I'm 30F and just diagnosed after a decade of treating CPTSD and Bipolar 2 and my psychiatrist thinks I may not be bipolar at all. She put me on Prazosin and Zyprexa and when I tell you I felt instant relief, it just really shook me up.

My world is just upside down right now, but not in a bad way? 

I'm doing a Self-Compassion for OCD workbook, as a way to slowly get acclimated to ERP while I wait to find a therapist I can afford and get my meds adjusted. 
 
So much of this seems like stuff I know of cognitively through other therapies, but these exercises and explanations have A LOT of examples of OCD clients and I think that helped a lot. 

ANYWAY - what comes next?? Obviously I need a therapist, that's priority one, but in the meantime? I don't know how to not be like this? ",OCD
806,"i’m convinced i’m going to be fired at my job, or have gotten the place shut down. i can’t handle thisssss. it’s killing me. i need reassurance so bad but asking my coworkers to tell me if im good or not feels so pathetic and i know its reassurance seeking so i haven’t at all. i just hate this",OCD
807,"Hello all!! I was diagnosed with ocd a year ago, after a bad experience with 🍃. I’ve been in therapy for existential ocd and dpdr, and have been doing exposure therapy. I still feel debilitated with the idea of the absurdity of the universe, question if my life is my own and if people actually exist etc. I also feel extreme amounts of Deja vu that interfere with my every day life. Over the summer, I noticed extreme progress but I’m falling back into my symptoms. I’m not sure where to go from here. Thanks! ",OCD
808,"In relation to exposure therapy and getting better and kicking compulsions in the nuts, what’s something you do that your ocd would be mad about? I won’t tell it, this is a safe space..

810,"One of the main things I'm struggling with in OCD is that I don't know where the border between a rational action and a compulsion is. These are some examples of day to day struggles I have (spoilered because they are detailing my OCD thought processes):

(Note: you don't have to go into these specific examples further, I am not looking for reassurance just as stated in the rules of this subreddit, they are purely meant to illustrate the type of thoughts I mean)

>!- When the towel I dry dishes with touches the top of my pants very shortly, do I replace it? Particles from flushing the toilet could be present on my clothes but I never see others doing this.

- How long do I wash my hands after going to the toilet? How do I make sure every square millimeter of my hands are clean and the majority of new bacteria are gone?

- In any bicycle rack at night here in the Netherlands I often see at least 2 bikes that forgot to turn off their lights. I always turn them off when I see it, but there are so many that I can't keep doing it, neither do other people who are walking by apparently. But I feel bad when I don't do it because what if their battery runs out and they get hit by a car at night?

- The lid of a pot fell on the ground but the ground has been touched by shoes and shoes have been outside and outside there could have been bird poo on the ground, do I clean the lid? I want to prevent people from getting sick but I never see other people go this far.!<

These OCD thoughts all have a realistic component such as cleaning things that potentially have bacteria on them to prevent people getting sick, or performing an action that could save others from something bad happening. But at the same time they seem to be far fetched: things could have bacteria on them but very indirectly, or the thoughts are things that the vast majority of people are not bothered by enough to undertake action so would it be realistic/expected that I give in to these compulsions.

My question is, how do you decide for yourself which of my thoughts are 'realistic' and worth taking action for, and which of my thoughts would be irrational and engaging with them would be classified as performing compulsions?",OCD
811,"Hey everyone!

Quick appeal for advice please. I have contamination OCD, heavily around the bathroom (toilet lid up when flushing, pee on floor (some house guests), and people not washing their hands.

Had someone come fix our washing machine last year. He used the bathroom, left the lid up, and didn’t wash his hands before touching things in my house. Haven’t been able to have guests since. Had to deep clean the bathroom but lately so tired I can’t do that as often.

We need some work done on our house so workers will need to use our bathroom. I need advice on how to cope? I can’t deep clean the whole house but I know I’ll risk a complete break if I don’t each night. ERP not working. All advice or stories welcome please!

",OCD
813,"Hey Guys,

  
I wanted to share my OCD Story/Journey. So it all started with Harm OCD where I would see someone walk past me and I would have a random thought like ( what if I strangled the person or something) and then I would look behind me each time to make sure that this was just a thought and not real life and it became so bad that anytime I would see someone ( any human being) I would have this uncontrollable thought about harming them ( which I of course I would NEVER do in real life) and I would always seek reassurance by looking to make sure that person was okay and I didn't actually do any harm to them ( False Memory OCD as well). Also whenever I would go on my phone and scroll on any social media like tiktok and instagram, I would be constantly worried because I would think to myself like ""what if I lost complete control and hired a hit man to kill someone or what if I got so mad at someone that I harmed them and what if I lost toal control and went psycho or what if i hired a hit man and planned someone's muder"". Of course I would NEVER do that because im not a bad person and I don't believe in killing anyone ( I dont even kill bugs, I just release them outside instead cause I feel horrible killing them) and I am a  extremely non violent person ( I dont believe in violence or guns), but it is so disturbing to have these thoughts and it always brings me so much anxiety. I know it sounds psychotic and ridiculous but one of my greatest fears is losing complete control and harmign someone. Because of this,  I feel like I am constantly on survival mode because of it. I KNOW in all honestly most likely I would not loose any control and even if I did, I would harm myself before harming others but these thoughts still scares me and brings so much anxiety. It makes going outside and living my life or enjoying my life impossible, because I'm constantly worried that did I harm anyone ? Im especially scared when I am around females because I think to myself men can probably defend themselves so they would be fine but im so scared to be around women ( and im a woman). I Just wanna be social and enjoy the company of people(especially fellow women) without this constant fear.



I also have hit and run ocd where I am scared that I will hit someone with my car and not even be aware about it. Before it was so bad that I used to drive the same route 3 times to make sure that I did not hit anyone with my car.



I also have health OCD ( last year it got so bad) because I was so scared that I had a certain disease that starts with the letter C, I would obsess over my poop and the color of it to make sure there was no blood and now I refuse to look at my poop at all because I know my health ocd will come back if I do, I also avoid the doctor's office and appointments in general because I have so much anxiety surrounding it. 

  
I also have a phobia of having my blood pressure taken and because of this my BP always comes high and I hate going to the doctor's office.



  
I always overthink everything and I always obsess and ruminate of things (it feels like my brain is constantly addicted to worrying about something/anything and that I can never just relax and be normal).



I also have Magical Thinking OCD where im scared that supernatural beings can read my mind and that they will do bad things to me and all. I also believe in all mythical creatures and all and that all makes it worse.



I also have uncontrollable negative thoughts and uncontrollable negative wishes as well. It just makes me so upset and gives me so much anxiety because I am the complete opposite of these thoughts and they do NOT represent what I want or wish for.

  
Has anyone else been through these themes of ocd/anxiety. I feel like I am living in anxiety constantly 



Also I am a huge self sabotager: Every time I feel like I am relaxing or becoming somewhat normal, I self-sabotage myself with a harm ocd thought or a negative thought ir worry in general which brings me back to a state of constant anxiety and worry. Its like my brain doesnt want me to relax 



I went to a psychic recently who told me that I have a heavy metal toxicity and that I should consume 3 bunches of coriander a week to detox my body of heavy metal toxicity.

I can understand where she's coming from as sometimes I worry if I don't get a doll now, I won't be able to ever because the price will keep going up, but my hobby is not coming from OCD itself. I've tried to explain to her that it's something I'm actually passionate about and that nothing about OCD makes me happy so it can't be OCD, but she doesn't believe me.

822,"I've recently been suffering from OCD following a traumatic event late last year. I had OCD as a teenager but was able to overcome it to a point and keep it a bay until recently. I'm in therapy, currently focusing on treating the trauma with EMDR and just started addressing the OCD last session.

My main issue is contamination OCD, especially related to smells and general ""outside dirt"". But I feel horrible that this is affecting my husband.

For example, I used to be able to tolerate cigarette smoke (I never really enjoyed it) but now I can't stand it and have asked that my husband take off the jacket he wears when smoking outside when he comes back inside. 

Another example is wearing outside shoes inside. I always take my shoes off when I come inside (it's been a habit even before my OCD returned) and wear inside shoes or slippers instead. I've never asked my husband to do that. I have bought him a nice pair of slippers but he will wear them to have a cigarette outside. 

However today there is a plumbing issue with the toilet in his bathroom so he used the bathroom I typically claim as my own though it is considered the guest bathroom. I keep this bathroom very clean and I always remove my indoor slippers when entering because they're in contact with all the other perceived dirt from the rest of the house (dog, outside shoes, ect). I feel like I can control the cleanliness it that bathroom, in addition to my own ""girl bedroom"" as opposed to the rest of the house where I feel like I can't keep it clean. So it gives me anxiety when others use it. I've even asked my mom when she visits to remove her shoes when she uses that bathroom which she had no problem with. But when I told my husband that bringing outside shoes into that bathroom is a trigger for me and he said he feels like he's walking on eggshells in his own house. I truly don't want to have these obsessions and I feel awful that they affect him like this. Should I not ask him to accommodate my OCD triggers? ",OCD

Over the years I’ve definitely gotten better with giving myself reaction therapy or whatever it’s called where I trigger myself on purpose but sometimes I don’t want to deal with that stuff and it’s quite annoying when my parents do it.

Obviously in the long run it'll make it better if I stop but it's really hard. I know I put the ""venting, no advice"" tag up but if anyone has any advice on quitting the vape specifically I'm all ears. Or if you have any stories of how quitting affected your OCD I'd love to hear it, even if it got worse. Idc I just hate feeling alone and I know you guys can unfortunately relate to how I feel.

We were supposed to start doing ERP over these last two sessions, but we haven't.

I went through a PHP, in which they said they couldn't help me because they don't specialize in OCD, and they referred me out. We're running out of money.

It just seems unfair and honestly draining knowing I have to deal with this for the rest of my life, I know I can find ways to manage it and so on but it’s the fact It’ll never go away which makes me upset. I’ve tried not attending to my OCD and just trying to live life against it but there’s still the constant thought in the back of my head that’ll never go away.

And then I’m like I never want to see them again 

And if I had intercourse or made out with them I might even feel like I got made dirty and I feel disgusted If I can smell their scent on me or my clothing so I start washing it and trying to scrub myself clean 

I just feel horrible the next day because they thoughts are so intense that music can’t overpower them nothing will distract me. Usually I can distract myself. I tend to listen to music a lot or watch series but on those days it’s impossible and it those feelings seem to physically hurt 

I think I have an avoidant attachment but it seems like it kind of clashes with ocd 

I also then don’t know how I feel about somebody like I don’t know if I like them or not. And I’m scared to make the wrong decision because then I’d get in the situation where they want to kiss me or have sex. 

I’ve been avoiding dating for years now because I just feel a lot better but at the same time I would want to find a partner. I usually only did like one night stands drunk or met someone on vacation where it helps that I don’t have to see them again ",OCD

For example, I once got obsessed with a TV show, but not in a “normal” way. There was one episode I watched every single night for a month. Another time, I hyperfixated on learning French. It got so intense that I only watched things in French, and I even felt bad writing in my native language because it didn’t feel “right” anymore.

They said the reason a person had Existential OCD is due to OCD latching onto the insecurity that the person doesn't matter, that the person has no value, and thus it creates an obsession but of course OCD being OCD it isn't noticeable that the obsession is due to ones own insecurities and rather feels real in the moment, as if its completely unrelated to the persons personal life.

852,"Hello, I've been diagnosed with OCD last year after many episodes of bad thoughts and losing control. I had symptoms for about 10 years but didn't knew where to ask for help and advice. My OCD behaves with bad intrusive thoughts, especially harming verbally and phisically other people in mind, never really expressed the thoughts only sometimes when i was alone with myself, but i don't do this anymore.
The first treatment consisted of aripiprazole + acutil initially, but i couldn't take it more than 1 month because of the reactions of agitation that it gave me. I couldn't even sit on a chiar for a few minutes and i had to take long walks daily. After that, i took risperidone (3 mg) in the evening and escitalopram (10 mg) in the morning for about 4 months but it made me really sleepy, slow and bored at work and at daily activities. After talking with my psychiater, he gave me amisulpride (one pill of 200 mg) in the evening and i maintained escitalopram (10 mg) in the morning. I feel better. A bit bored and with a lack of ideas for daily activities but is better than previous schemes. Does anyone have similar symptoms of OCD? What treatment do you guys take? Are there other schemes better than using antipsychotics?",OCD

Hi I’m Actias, 19F and I’m just lost for words… 

I have really self destructive compulsions which has lead to my parents having to baby sit me, pretty much… and my therapist keeps mentioning how I need independence from them to help “beat OCD” which I trust her… but I feel hesitant. 

My obsessions keep me from going to school often, or staying in the classroom at least. I get so tense I puke and have to pace the halls… meaning this is the second time I’m retaking twelfth grade… I’m humiliated. I can’t hold down a job either, at least so far… I just lash out and go home against all consequences… because home is safe and I know I’m protected by my rituals in my room. 

Honestly I’m just worried because my little sisters are copying my habits so I need to leave before I ruin their lives, but I’m afraid I don’t know how to live on my own..? I’m scared of myself… help please haha. ",OCD

856,"If you experience very high anxiety due to OCD, you can try physical exercise. This way, thanks to increased BDNF levels, you can replace neuroplastically reinforced thought patterns with more positive and flexible ones.

Another important point is that the automatization of our obsessive thoughts is related to how much we ""resolve"" them with compulsions after they first arise. In other words, the more or more intense compulsions you perform, the more you send the message ""this is important"" to your brain. This is important because when the related obsession comes to your mind again during the day, you will use more mental or physical power to resolve it. This is because your brain spends energy to remember and fully implement the first compulsion it performed for the related obsession. So, our brain reuses the produced compulsions. Therefore, we can do ERP when our mind is clear and less impulsive in the first hours of the day.",OCD

I once had serious OCD many years ago and now it has been reduced to very minimal state.

3. inference capability - good at reasoning 
4. stronger abstract thinking - can capture conceptual ideas more easily

However I recently got a new laptop, a beautifully expensive one and now it's like a song stuck in my head to sandpaper the screen, drop a heavy object on it, spill my coffe over it, etc. 

And I have no idea how to deal with this. So far it's not affecting my behaviour in an unhealthy way, mostly its ensuring I don't put my laptop in stupid places like the floor or next to the stove while cooking.

But it is still quite annoying and really stressful. I feel like certain objects in my surroundings become like in old cartoons when you could see the animation cell, exactly which object would start moving. 

Right now there's a pair of scissors on this table and I'm somehow hyperaware of their location.

874,"Hi all. My OCD is mostly real event ocd, but in hindsight many of my other behaviors can also be attributed to ocd. This is one of them. I'm 22 and for as long as I can remember, I've had this quirk while gaming on a console, where during downtime(moments where I don't need to be controlling the game, loading screens), very often I will press the home button to bring up the console interface, you know? 

For example, I'm playing a fighting game on my PS5, and a cutscene gets activated which takes away my control from the game for a few seconds. Most of the time, I will press the home button either 2 or 4 times. Typically I press it and bring up the PS5 overlay, and then again to bring it down. I then repeat this, making 4 presses total. If it's not like that, I quickly feel slightly uneasy, and feel tension and unrest(think restless legs)in my hands or arms for a second. I will do this multiple times a session, probably doing it every 10-30 minutes or so. This sounds like the Just Right theme to me. I historically have similar behaviors with light switches and door locks, and it's also this pattern of ""4 times"".

I have similar behaviors with my phone. When pressing the home button, I always drag my thumb down from above the home button to the bottom of the screen, sometimes multiple times. Maybe to ''clear"" it? Or clean fingerprints. I'm not sure. I also do this thing where I load an image to send someone, then do that dragging behavior on the send button a few times, and then cancel the image.

It’s not something that’s a constant issue but in the last year it’s been worse than it had in over a decade. Because it’s also been the worst year of my life in over a decade.

Whatever I just want to be able to eat consistently if anyone has any advice let me know. ",OCD

893,I'm dealing with false memory OCD and it's really hard. Any advice on overcoming false memory and real event OCD? How can I let things go and move on so I can enjoy the present?,OCD
894,"I'm 27/F and have pretty bad OCD.  My biggest challenge is with false memory OCD. My false memory ""episodes"" (when I'm ruminating and anxious about the false memory). I have made some progress with dealing with this but feel stuck with progress right now. I used to ruminate over specific false memory or real events for weeks or even a month until my mind could let it go. Now, usually I only ruminate over the false memory or real event for only about a day. Usually by the next day I moved on and am not worried about the specific false memory. I tell myself that this is temporary and I'll be over it tomorrow, which is nice to be able to limit my ruminating to a day, but I've been stuck here for a while now. How can I further reduce the rumination to a few hours or less? I want to eventually be able to immediately let things go and not worry about what did or didn't happen in the past and be able to enjoy the present. Also, my false memories usually are very recent. So I'm not really ruminating over false or real events years ago, but rather very recent and then immediately after will start to ruminate and analyze my memory. ",OCD

900,"My ritual for the past couple of weeks has been to like 5 consecutive comments in a row when I’m on social media. Then it was boosted to 8 comments, and for the past few days I HAVE to like 10 comments in a row or something bad will happen. 
Another ritual is if I see something on the floor at work/at home/ in public, I need to clean/pick it up, I can’t ignore flaws/mistakes or something bad will happen. 

I have been strict with myself, doing these things without fail. Scrolling through social media is difficult for me, so I deactivated my Instagram to avoid this. Now I only like TikTok comments. I know it’s so stupid. 

Still, I have had such a draining week. I started school on Tuesday. All was well. I went to the campus the next morning, bright and early. I was locked out in the snow and ended up getting frostnip on my right hand with agonizing pain - the campus was closed due to bad weather conditions. I felt so stupid. My fingers were numb for two days. 
That night, I went to work. I ended up going to urgent care because I was having a kidney related scare. I was in so much pain. I mean, tmi but urinating blood. 
Today, I had class and then drove straight to work. I was driving home, and my car had this HORRIBLE sound coming from the back. I park it and guess what!!!

A flat.

902,"Hi everyone! I first would like to start off by saying that I have not been diagnosed with OCD, but I have done plenty of research and am concerned that I do have it. I am wary about self diagnosing for various different reasons, but it's something that's gotten to the point where I would like to seek help and get better! I've tracked my behavior that is related to OCD all the way through childhood, and any advice I see on reassuring myself, I usually take and am able to handle by myself. However, there are simply things that I think a professional could help with (such as a diagnosis of one thing or another and then treatment for it) that go beyond what I can do for myself.

I live in a pretty conservative household, and my parents aren't necessarily ones to care too much about mental illness but I will say that it runs heavily in my family, on both sides. I guess I am skeptical because my mother is the type to brush off things like this and say that there is nothing to do about it, while my dad is one to just straight up say behavior like this is crazy. I have done a good job of keeping my mental health out of conversations with them, but I think now is the time I truly try professional help.

So, I guess the advice I could been looking for is how to approach this with them? How can I make them really see my point of view, and take my proposal seriously? Literally, even if it's a step by step instructional list, it'll be helpful. Should I bring up different research I've done? I've never had conversations like this with them before, and I don't want them to see me as crazy or try to talk me out of knowing I need therapy. People who have been in the same place or anyone in general, any advice? Thanks!",OCD

907,"Dear Reddit, 
I have a question for you. I tried to look it up but the top answers seem to be of the Redpill TM (ed?) variety. And it seems like longer answers get responses here . No shade to you all, especially cause I know that you all struggle with anxiety in a big way. I myself was diagnosed with OCD about three months ago and have decided  to accept that I have a thought disorder. I did a lot of processing of the diagnosis upon when it first happened.
So I am sitting outside, and I feel like I have no reason to be outside now that my cigarette is out. That is, I feel that I have no belonging in the world, especially when I am out of my Comfort Zone, which is my bed. (Typical anxiety case) but now it has come to my attention that my sister might have a personality disorder so I sort of feel unsafe around her too. I have just now decided that my exposure therapy is to smoke and then go outside and be around other people. I have noticed that I have a fear of people, especially the idea that people can hear what I am saying or expressing. It should be noted that I am in therapy (both group and individual) and am in the recovery process. I don’t like getting unbelievably stoned when I go through this process, I just hit the pen once at a time.  
I don’t really want to discuss weed as part of the healing process here because I think that is another conversation. And I have decided to post this on multiple forums, so if you see this more times than one I am sorry/apologize. The sun is setting now, and I am writing this outside. 

TLDR: So the fear is: I am scared to be outside because I have a fear that I will be attacked or that something violent will happen to me or someone else. The therapist in me asks what is the worst that will happen. My only solace is knowing that this once never happened to me, at least physically. I find it interesting when people write a whole story on their anxiety and never mention their trauma. I am thankful to have the resources to say that I have experienced complex trauma.
One of my new solutions has been to start carrying pepper spray on my person no matter what to help with the fear. Is there anyone out there who has gone through this problem, or if not, are there amy thoughts? I don’t know how to end this. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading it. ",OCD
908,"I’m having overwhelming thoughts about me getting injured (accidentally not being harmed by someone) or relieving old injuries, especially when I’m trying to go to sleep. (I’m incredibly squeamish so these thoughts make me physically nauseous)
I’m not imagining or thinking of harming myself or others nor do I fear getting injured, I just keep replaying imagined and old injuries happening to me over and over again. Can anyone relate?",OCD
909,"I used to have crippling contamination OCD which pretty much made my life hell. Even something as simple as microwaving a bowl of porridge would take me over an hour because I'd constantly have to be washing my hands or various parts of the kitchen. I could not touch other people and leaving the house at all was mental hell because of all the opportunities to walk by something unclean.

I consider myself to be 'over' it now. I am able to live a normal life, go to work, have physical contact with other people etc. But, there are things other people will just blithely do without a second thought that make me absolutely cringe and which I 100% could not bring myself to do. For example:
- Putting an object (e.g. a laptop) on the floor, then picking it up and using it without sanitising both it and your hands.
- Honestly, just picking anything up off the ground at all. I know this is bad, but if I am out of the house and I drop something, I just cannot pick it up, even though that's the right thing to do. Because I don't have any facilities to wash my hands afterwards. And then I'd be touching other things with dirty hands like my keys and phone etc and the number of dirty things would just spiral.
- Putting shopping baskets on the floor or shopping bags with groceries inside.
- Eating a sandwich (or any food) with bare hands, having touched things that other people have touched and not washed your hands (I mean e.g. holding the pole on a bus and then eating a sandwich with that same hand)
- Using public toilets

At this point, I'm no longer sure really why these things horrify me so much. At first, my OCD was born out of a terror of somehow ingesting a parasite egg. Now, I can rationalise that fear better. But, even so, there's a fear of these things which I now can't fully explain.

Are the issues that I listed things that a 'normal' person would fear? Or, would you say they're left over from the contamination OCD? I can't decide. I've come such a long way, so it's hard for me to judge with these relatively minor things.",OCD
910,"hi, I have OCD, which mostly manifests itself as contamination OCD. Personally, I remember a time before I had OCD. I remember a time where I didn't care about constantly washing my hands or avoiding certain things, or any of the crazy shit I do now, it didn't even cross my mind. I've been reading online that OCD can be triggered by stressful events especially in child hood, or a change in family (and many more). My dad is an alcoholic and has progressively gotten worse throughout my life. I'm thinking maybe stress related to that triggered it? or at least contributed to it? As they say, genetics load the gun and environment pulls the trigger. I obviously don't have a direct cause, but as I remember it I was young at it literally felt like a switch flipped in my brain and I started obsessing over contamination and having compulsions. Let me know if you remember a time before your OCD and if you do what might have triggered it. ",OCD
911,"I have a problem. I've frequently found that I am often (not exclusively) attracted to people with red hair. However, my mom also happens to have red hair. And with how relatively rare red hair is, with my OCD, I worry it's like some weird incestuous thing.

Truthfully, I didn't even know my mom's hair was red until I was a teen. For most of my life, she styled and dyed it to look more dirty blonde, like my hair. I just assumed it was her natural color for the longest time until I saw old photos of her.

I liked people with red hair before that, but now whenever I see someone who is attractive with red hair, I keep worrying it's some weird incest thing. I don't know how to get over it.

I do know that to be somewhat true. even when I am giving into my ocd these “bad” things still happen. but I can’t help but spiral and I just keep thinking “I knew it.” it makes me want to dig my heels into the ground and never challenge a thought again. how do you all keep pushing in moments like these? ,OCD
913,"I have had severe OCD in the past (still a lot left, but to a lesser extent); and here the issue is I also struggle to define whether what makes the process difficult is my OCD/anxiety or not.

Context: I have been researching Narcissism as part of my healing journey towards abusers.

I am not asking for a diagnosis which I already have, but rather whether a pattern (which contains SOME elements I have identified as OCD, and a majority of ""unsure"" for me) is OCD- related; or if it is normal. When I asked for Narcissism-related terms-clarification in a sub, briefly highlighting my research process struggle; somebody replied they had been been-searching the topic for 3 months; presumably to justify/validate my experience; which in turn made me feel like I was weak for experiencing this research as an ordeal to escape when other people seem to seemlessly spend months at it. 
To me this feels like a prison. I wondered if the process I go through is the same for everyone and I'm simply weak.

Description: part of what creates the burden of research is being forced to spend hours on a single page re-reading paragraphs, lines of paragraphs etc until I ""feel"" the ""right"" thing I'm supposed to realise, ""feel"" the concept to my core until I have ""properly"" felt it and until it's not hindered by ""impure"" intrusive thoughts (the very last part I know to be OCD but not sure of anything before that including the ""feel the concept ""properly"" ""to my core""); 
re-reading entire pages without ""feeling the feeling of understanding"" because of attention issues and therefore facing each new page as a new ordeal; etc. 
The worst; yesterday I also felt this was the time to dive into applying the new knowledge to the records I kept of my messages to my N. Needless to say the second-guessing myself, the ""I might have unadvertadly erased something in my Note so I have to erase everything and re-collect the elements of the webpage line by line again""; the ""I have not perused my douzens of bookmarked pages enough"", etc. 
And when I find a new concept that feels like an ""epiphany"" but fail to find adequately; multiple confirmed definitions online; needless to say I feel I cannot ""move on"" because leaving crucial new knowledge superficially acquired corrupts the process and means I will not be ""safer"" against my N.  
And during the overall research, because I'm driven by my fears of disrespecting my past experiences by not researching ""thoroughly""; any element that my gaze might wonder upon on a page, a search result/anything; might feel ""crucial""; forcing me to open dozens of pages in new tabs and expending the hell.

Ocd for me has always been really sexual. Graphic images of having sex with anyone really and overall i have constant thoughts on sex. Which has kind of made me repulsed by it, or at least scared. Exhausted too.

So to the question. How do i get a better view on sex, how can i be less repulsed by it and to be able to actually go for it and have sex? I hate it because as i said, i want to be able to have sex.

I have been seeing that a lot of younger people are on this thread, and I am so happy you guys have found a community that can be helpful. I wish I had this community whenever I was an adolescent, it would have made me feel so much better about a lot of things. With that being said, some of these posts can be unhelpful given the condition. It can lead you to ruminate and also cause more intrusive thoughts so please remember to take space from the internet if you feel as if things are making your anxiety worse. Here are some encouraging things I wanted to share with you!

OCD was ranked in the top 10 most disabling conditions by the World Health Organization in 1990. I know I promised encouraging but hear me out. I hear this statistic thrown around from time to time, but they fail to mention that this was in the 90s. It is no longer in the top 10 and hasn't been for a couple of decades now. We have come so far since then in our understanding of mental disorders and I can attest to that!!

I was officially diagnosed OCD at 17 (I am 30 now). I was constantly living in a state of fear, shame and embarrassment. My intrusive thoughts were eating me alive. I had convinced myself I had schizophrenia. I just sat and cried for weeks. I missed almost an entire quarter of school; I went in before to take tests and I took my homework home for the week.  I felt so alone and so wrong. I found a psychiatrist, I just cried and talked through a couple of my more disturbing thoughts and I will never forget how she never wavered, did not look at me weird or with disgust. She listened to me and told me these things were so common in what people with OCD struggle with and she said ""which, you absolutely have."" I was very confused because I do not have what people associate with OCD. The cleanliness, organization. I have my own quirks, but I am a type b personality THROUGH AND THROUGH. Right then and there, I had a name for this. I had something I can research. I was NOT schizophrenic; I was NOT a horrible person. I was not cured overnight but the relief I felt just by knowing I wasn't alone, and my intrusive thoughts were extremely common in everyone with this disorder, the weight that was lifted off of my shoulders was the biggest relief I have ever felt, even to this day.

I followed her advice and started 20 mg of Prozac (do not look up side effects, stay away from that. our disorder literally GASLIGHTS us you guys, that little pest). I was terrified to take the medicine because I did NOT follow said advice of stay away from WebMD, but I was so desperate to get better, I was willing to do anything. If my psychiatrist told me to stand on my head for 3 hours a day to be cured, I would have done it lol.  I will never forget that after about 3 weeks of taking it consistently, I was shopping for a dress for homecoming. I was in the fitting room with my mom, and I just said ""mom... I feel like me again"". We both sobbed together and I knew I would not let this control me.  

It takes a lot of work. I am not going to lie. For me, medication and therapy is what has helped the most. Do not be afraid and always be honest. They are not going to lock you up. I have violent intrusive thoughts and the follow up question my psychiatrist asked me was ""What do you think or how do you feel after these thoughts, and would you think you would act on them?"" I told her the thoughts terrify me and it terrifies me to express them verbatim. I told her I immediately feel shame. She told me it's the second thought that counts. Personal example of intrusive thought I had as a teen while my mom would cook would to be to harm her. Immediately I felt horror and betrayal of myself and morality. The second thought is the thought that counts. It's the thought that contradicts the uncomfortable first thought, because it is YOU. You are disturbed by the first intrusive thought. That is NOT you. That is your disorder. That has helped me in so many situations. 

I am now a mom (something that used to terrify me, due to OCD), a wife, doing what I love every day. I have hard days but bottom line is, I want you to know, you ARE normal. You are never alone. You can overcome. You have to put the work in but you **will** overcome it if you do. There is healing in helping others heal as way. There is community. I am sending you all the strength and all of the confidence that this disorder tries to strip away. Sending all of my love, compassion and empathy.

I would love to hear others stories with managing/overcoming this. Especially those who have found alternative ways that can help those who don't have the means right now to explore the avenues that cost money and time. I will add one more thing, a ton of therapists will do a sliding scale based on your income. There are therapists and psychologists that will work with you. Do some research in your area and best wishes.

928,"Hi everyone,
I (25F) was in a relationship with my partner (29M) for six months. He’s always struggled with severe anxiety and OCD, which he was open about from the beginning. Despite this, he was incredibly kind, loving, and attentive. He made me feel like the center of his world and constantly expressed his love for me. We talked about moving in, marriage, and kids—he truly made me feel safe, loved, and like we were building something meaningful.

For most of our relationship, his anxiety and OCD weren’t major issues between us. They were usually directed toward his schooling and career, not our relationship. I learned how to calm him down and bring him back when he spiraled, and I didn’t mind doing it because I loved him deeply. Over time, we got into a groove where I was there for him emotionally, and it felt like we were working as a team. I was happy in the relationship, and I thought he was too.

In the weeks before the breakup, things were amazing. We weren’t arguing, and he was showing me so much love and care. We had reached a point where we deeply understood and respected each other. We even had serious conversations about the next steps in our relationship—moving in together and navigating our future differences. I thought we had overcome so much and were getting stronger together.

But suddenly, he began to spiral. He’d struggled with weed in the past and promised me he would quit because he knew it was important to me. But I later discovered he was still using it and hiding it from me. When I confronted him, he apologized and said he wanted to quit for himself. I chose to stay and support him. However, his usage escalated in the weeks before the breakup—he was getting extremely high to the point of making himself sick. He even got an ear infection that week, which I suspect was related to his behavior.

During his spiral, he became consumed by fears about our future. He started saying things like:
	•	“I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.”
	•	“No matter what I do, it’ll never be enough, and you’ll expect more.”
	•	“I feel like I’m forcing myself to be in this relationship.”

He also started bringing up old issues we had already resolved, like my preferences for raising kids (secular, no alcohol/drugs/pork). Initially, he agreed to these things, but during his spiral, he started calling me “controlling” or “extreme,” even though I had been flexible and clear about my intentions.

Another source of tension was his relationship with my family. While he’d never met them, I had opened up about my family trauma. Instead of supporting me, he started saying things like, “I hate your family, and I don’t want to be anywhere near them,” and tied their issues to me. He said I condoned abuse when I tried to explain my upbringing, which hurt deeply.

Last week, he spiraled heavily. He started saying he felt guilty for being a burden and didn’t want to be the reason I went through “so many changes.” He said he felt like I deserved someone better and that no matter what he did, it wouldn’t be enough. He even said, “What if we just took a step back and were friends? Then there wouldn’t be pressure, and I wouldn’t lose you.”

I stayed calm and supportive, reminding him that we could work through anything together. For a few days, he flip-flopped between saying, “I’m not leaving; we’ll figure this out,” and, “I feel like I’m forcing myself to stay in this relationship.” This wasn’t the first time he had spiraled, and loving messages usually helped snap him out of it. So I sent him a heartfelt letter, telling him I accepted him, loved him, and wasn’t giving up on us.

Instead of responding, he ignored the letter. When I called to tell him I missed him, he sent me a cruel final message:
“It’s over. Move on. Don’t contact me again. I’ll drop off your stuff, but I don’t want to see you.”

This was completely out of character for him. He’s always been sweet, kind, and communicative—even when struggling. He’s never cut me off like this before. He used to cry when I left his apartment because he didn’t want me to go. He was always communicative, apologetic, and afraid of losing me. Now it’s been five days of no contact, and he hasn’t dropped off my things like he said he would.

I’m heartbroken and confused. I know his mental health struggles are severe, and I’m deeply worried about him. But I also feel blindsided because we had been doing so well just days before.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Does anyone have advice on whether he’ll calm down and reach out, or is it truly over? How do I move forward while still caring about him?",OCD

She didn't wash it after raw shellfish was in it because ""it was still frozen"". My dad said he sees her do it sometimes and washes it after she leaves, but I'm not cool with it at all. 
Aparently, she doesn't wash dishes with soap hardly ever, just rinses them out until all visible food is gone (usually) and leaves them to dry.

I ask my girlfriend for reassurance all the time, and she's starting to get overwhelmed with the amount.

935,"I’m praying I don’t get judged for this. But, back in late May of 2022 ( literally right before I graduated high school), I added this one random girl from my school on Snapchat. She posted something about a graduation party , so I swiped up on her story basically saying how I can’t believe we’re almost graduated. She replied and we had a really short and simple conversation. The next day ( i believe) , we started talking a lot , and I just so happened to see her at the highschool when we were grabbing our graduation outfits and doing the rehearsal. When I saw her irl, I kinda got turned off ( I heard she was kinda crazy) , and on top of that , she was a little ugly irl. I remember seeing her Snapchat bio , and she was close friends with my female cousin ( a year younger than me) , who I happened to experiment sexually with when I was 10-11 years old. I remember going to work later that day and having sort of a lightbulb flick thought ( it wasn’t a good thought though) , what if my cousin told her about what happened when we were younger? So I started to kind of panic and immediately distanced myself from that girl. I also experimented sexually with one of my female friends when I was 10-11 , and from that day onwards, I’ve been pretty much living in paranoia and a little bit of guilt about someone finding out and my life being ruined . On top of that, It’s gotten worse to now sometimes I wonder if a girl I added off of quick add ( Snapchat) is underage even if they told me they were 18+ or had 18 and above in their bio, and I get so much guilt and anxiety about that. I even had a quick thought on what if I did something inappropriate with my younger cousin when I was 15-16 last February and I just can’t exactly remember when it happened , and it still eats me alive when I think about it. I’m sorry for the long vent, I just wish I felt normal again. No matter how much I try to do things that old me used to do, life always feels “ off”.  I always kept the top part about when I was younger a secret up until early (ish ) 2024, then I vented to one of my best friends and he told me that that’s a normal thing to do at a young age. Since then, I have told multiple friends and they all say they did similar stuff, but my brain just can’t accept that. Please help me, I quite literally overthink everything nowadays. 2021 was the last full year that I felt normal ( coincidentally, the best year of my life so far) . It’s not just about sexual related things either, sometimes I’ll wonder if I messed up something at work or hit a car while driving/hit someone and drove off. I just wanna live my life how I was supposed to live it after highschool ( carefree and happy) before whatever it is ( I think it’s ocd) hit me unexpectedly.

937,"I keep seeing people dismissing people with clear OCD tendencies as faking the disorder just because it doesn't fit their idea of obsession and compulsion.

We all know checking things a lot, worrying if one will harm someone or if they're p3do, washing hands until they bleed, hoarding etc. are most recognized themes here.

What they're entirely missing out is that the themes can be completely different from the expectation.

Take cleaning for example. Sure, many people simply enjoy having a spotless home and feeling the freshness of just a clean environment. Yet, some people do it because they worry if their environment is covered with dust or anything they deem as unclean will make the worst happen like having a rash or acne breakout, they will be contamined by something dirty in their eyes. They may have a meltdown if their environment is cleaned by someone else because they're not in control over eliminating the source of their fear. They may experience a meltdown if their sudden change of routine makes them miss out on cleaning and having to spend the day or night in that same environment.

Another example might be hygiene obsessed people. Are there people who simply like to engage in self care and pamper themselves up? Sure. But are there people who think that if they don't shower immediately after sweating or cleaning because the dust has fallen onto their body, the worst awaits them? Are there people who HAVE to scrub their body because they feel they're a walking dead skin and disgusting? Are there people who religiously moisturize themselves and refuse to do anything that may cause the lotion to be washed out because they fear something? Are there people who think that they're going to break out in acne if they don't shave their entire face? Are there people who fear that if they don't wash their hair as soon as it's a little oily it will get soaked into their sheets, pillow, jacket, hoodie etc. and make something happen? Are there people who think that if their hair touches the bus seat they're unfixably dirty until they wash their hair? I can go on but I think you get.

Now, are there people with OCD who overdo their compulsions? Sure. Yet, there are people who might get their hands dirty and have an internal meltdown, wash them thoroughly once and who continue to check their hands and feel awful despite only engaging in the activity to get the dirt once. Do they still obsess over it? Yes.

There are so many manifestations of the disorder that it's so embarrassing to gatekeep which behaviors and obsessions count as OCD and which doesn't. It's rather simple. You have an obsession which triggers a compulsion to ease the anxiety around it no matter if you do the compulsion once or 100 times.",OCD
938,"Anyone else feel like bottling up emotions is a significant trigger for OCD?

I’ve struggled with ROCD and noticed that the symptoms amped up following suppressing real emotions related to conflict within my relationship.

It’s like I’m so cognitively-oriented that my brain would rather obsess over the same thoughts over and over rather than feel and express those feelings. Almost like the OCD is a distraction from what’s going on on a feeling level. Operating purely on the level of managing the thoughts is just a temporary bandaid while processing and expressing the feelings is the true uprooting of it all.

But learning to express feelings is hard. Feelings aren’t always logically graspable, which is always how I’ve operated (and I would assume most OCD people are like this).

I don’t know where I’m going with this but I would love to hear others’ takes on this.",OCD
939,"My OCD is constantly making me question whether I made the right decision, making me imagine everything going wrong and me starving. It tells me I won’t make it, that everyone will see me fail.

Last year, my OCD was pretty under control and I barely had any anxiety. Now, I’m quitting my 9-5 job to work for myself. I’ll set my own hours, and with that, everything depends on me, and that’s a lot of responsibility. And since I also have ADHD, having a routine and sticking to schedules is really hard because of the executive function difficulties. In the past, I had to switch from self-employment to a 9-5 job because of my mental health (OCD + ADHD), and now that I’m better and, in a way, more prepared (diagnosis, medication, therapy), I’m doing the opposite: I’m switching back, but this time from the exact same 9-5 job to the same self-employment I had before. Therapy is on hold right now, and I won’t be back until next week, so I have no support at the moment.

This transition + the trauma of things going wrong in the past is making my OCD super intense, and I can’t stop questioning my decision and being terrified that everything will go exactly as it did before. But back then, when it happened, I didn’t even know what I was going through. I had no diagnosis, no therapy, no clue. Things have changed, but my OCD says otherwise. It says the story will repeat itself and that I’ll never be able to work for myself, no matter how much better it is for me and my quality of life. I can’t stop thinking about it, and none of my methods are really helping. Reading, writing, meditating—they bring relief, if it weren’t for those, I’d definitely be worse. The thing is, you can’t do these things all day long, so when I’m doing other stuff, I spend most of my time obsessing and doubting myself.

This is mostly a vent, but I’m open to suggestions or hearing from anyone who’s been through something similar.",OCD

941,"Hi fellow OCD sufferers!

I (M28) have been with my partner (F28) for 5 years. She is the love of my life and I love her so very much. However, she has moderate OCD that waxes and wanes as the illness does, but it’s recently worsened. 

Some background - I also suffer from ROCD, it’s taken me years to work on it and am on medication + therapy 1x every 2 weeks with OCD specialist. I’ve made strides, but I’m not perfect. My GF, does this and more. She’s on medication and sees her therapist 1-2x a week and is a top OCD specialist. My GF is also in a rigorous school program and her stress levels are extreme. She has a lot of trouble managing stress and from psycho education I’ve learned those with OCD manage stress poorly and it exacerbates OCD. She also has mild ADD. 

Anyways, I’m a very very chill guy. I don’t stress much and I’m more of a “whatever, it happens” attitude. She is the opposite. Her OCD causes her severe overthinking and reassurance seeking. But she’s so stressed out from it that she’s constantly in an anxious state and it’s debilitating for her :(. 

The issue I’m having is its effect on me. I’ve learned to manage things like reassurance seeking; not giving in and/or taking space if she’s particularly struggling. I’ve been to her therapist with her to learn these things, my GF is great at listening and working to improve herself and us thankfully. But, the constant stress and negativity from spiraling about what could happen when it’s so far-fetched is taking its toll on me. 

I’ve talked to her about needing to manage her stress levels because it stresses me to no end. She really does try, but I feel there is nothing else to do until the school program ends. Just looking for advice here. 

I hate that sometimes I want alone time to get away from the stress and OCD as I love her to pieces. I’ll stick by her side forever and ever because she’s worth it. But man, the flare ups are especially difficult for me to handle.

950,"Hello everyone,

Long story short, I went through some fertility trauma/pregnancy loss late 2021, early 2022. I took a year off from trying to get my ""mind right"". I initially went through a deep wave of anxiety/depression for a month before it spiraled into these constant unwanted suicidal thoughts and images. At first, I thought I was having a near psychotic break because I never felt these feelings before, and they were constant. I tried Zoloft, and clomipramine, and they really didn't do anything for me. Prior to this fertility stuff, I was fortunate enough to never really experience anxiety or depression.    

Long story short, over the years, they are still present, some days worse than others, but always there. I welcomed my double rainbow baby in late 2023, and was hoping they would stop but never really did. I decided to stop taking all meds due to great amount of weight gain and no real mental relief/benefits. 

Over the last few months, I seem to have some struggles fertility wise again as things really aren't going my way with regards to it, however: I have been sleeping better and have had some really mentally calm downs. And now this week, they are really bad again. I love my family, I love my life, and I fear so badly that I will act on it one day out of feelings of hopelessness of never feeling better. I have normal energy, I try to work out and eat healthy every day, I go to work every day, I don't do any recreational drugs, and I rarely ever dink anymore.

In other words, I can't just do another ritual and make things better like I have other times, because of the nature of what happened.  It has left me feeling very down, like many things I had been looking forward to doing once I got past a certain separate ritual are currently invalidated.  I was hoping my view on it would get better after a week, but it's actually getting worse, settling into a real funk.

At this point its like a drug addiction relying on the drug to relive any stress, a short term solution that'll make things worse the more you engage in using, requiring more dosages, frequency of taking said drug, and utmost dependency on the drug itself, slowly degrading your mental and physical health to the point of utter exertion.

To me I'm not used to it, not used to relying on my own opinions, my own capacity of judgement, always afraid ill be shunned out of society if I say or do one wrong thing. I've made my set of mistakes in the past and it freaked me out. it's pushes me towards suicide. because to me if I lose my chance at life, get shunned out, rejected etc etc. My dreams die with it. My dream of being a writer, an artist, validated by my own friends and family, all would be gone. And it breaks me, it makes me feel hopeless, I hate it.

But I can't go on like this much longer, for sooner or later I'll break. so I need to make a change.

I'm looking for a suitable therapist at the moment someone that I can trust the judgement of. 

Currently my therapist is too easy going for me, and that's fine for most people but I need someone who is staunch and has good judgement, also preferably a good capacity of wisdom to help me get through.

Am I possibly a terrible person? 
Is there a chance I'll be shunned out of society? 
Are my friends and family slowly turning on me?
Am I a horrible person?
Are all these things true about me? 

even if they are true I have no other choice but to accept the possibility that they might be. 
Even if people shame me or come after me. fuck it! Let it happen whatever it Is that is waiting to happen, I can't keep worrying about this I just need to try to be better.

I need to push past these thoughts. I NEED to push forward.

Dedicate myself to what's infront of me and make the best of it. The easy part is saying it, now I gotta do what i can to make it a reality. From now on I'll be trying to log myself and every action I make and try to cut down as many bad behaviours and reassurance seeking as possible.

Incorporate excercise, socialising, mindfulness, and some of my hobbies to keep me distracted and probably listen to music.

I'm afraid and anxious as hell and have almost no motivation to really keep going, but I'll try.

Maybe this is what I get for always wishing to be one of God's strongest soldiers.

958,"Hello All,

For the past year, I've been struggling with surveillance OCD. I actually left my previous apartment, and am now leaving my current apartment (which I love), do to this fear.

First, my phone started using astronomical amounts of data, making me feel as if someone hacked it. Then, little things started seeming ""out of place"". I'm not home often, so it made me feel that someone could be coming into my apartment when I'm gone, and installing cameras.

So, I moved to a new apartment in March of last year - and weird things happened.

I had a defect on my screen protector that I couldn't get off, but it disappeared overnight. I brushed a piece of paper onto the floor, but when I woke up, it was back in the same place.

There's other little things that have been happening. So, I moved in with my parents until I find a new place. Even there, I feel like I'm being watched. Yesterday, I was home alone when I heard the door open/close, but nobody was there. I looked outside and nobody was around. I don't even feel safe in the home where I grew up!

  
Many people have tried to convince me that these are just normal events that my OCD is linking together, but I'm scared to death. I'll have to get a new phone, computer, and car because I'm so afraid that the ""intruders"" hacked my belongings. 

I can't live like this. I see a counselor/coach and a prescriber. Any tips to fight back on this? It's mind over matter at this point.

  
Thanks in advance!

I think right now my mind is just stuck. I've been practicing ERP but my mind still seems to be dredging up ""evidence"" to prove the false memory is real.

Proof it isn't real: I didn't panic about this until recently, so it might have been an intrusive thought that latched on to a real memory.

Mostly reassurance seeking and getting stuck in persistent thought loops (often ABOUT being stuck in the thought loop). He's very emotionally intelligent, so he knows what's happening and is quite frustrated about it. It breaks my heart. 

Slated for professional help next month, so we're already open and interested in medication or therapy (or both!) But here asking about what else, if anything, I can do to best support him. Thanks! ",OCD

964,"Background I have spiritual/ moral scrupulosity OCD. When I was a child I was convinced I could hear the voice of God and I had to ask him what to do about everything which led to one of the most traumatising eras of my life where I basically performed extreme compulsions constantly to the derailment of my life. I didn’t know it was OCD then I was a teen but how I was able to get myself out of it was to basically ignore all the voices (not really voices) or intuitions that I got (I was doing ERP without knowing it) and just forging on and it saved me then. However a lot of times it feels like I’m ignoring valid intuitions or signals that I need and when I ignore them and they come true I go into shame spiral. For example, I went downstairs to hang my laundry and wondered if my mum had hung them for me cause she turned off the washing machine. The “intuition” told me she hadn’t but because it’s too scary to listen to them I went to check and sure enough she hadn’t hung them. The intuition was right. A lot of times they are right but I can’t listen to them because the thought of going back to listen to these feelings is so traumatic I have a physical response to it like my body seizes up but when I don’t listen and they turn out correct it’s like oh you don’t even care for yourself you’re being purposefully dumb ignoring the voices you’re so stupid, one day you’ll lose the intuition and then you’d be fked forever. I don’t know what to do, it’s like I’m caught between a rock and a hard place. ",OCD

966,"Basically when I am tempted to sin, I might have a thought like “what if God punished you if you did this?” Or “what if you made a vow unconsciously that you will quit your hobbies if you commit this sin?” And if I fall to that sin anyways, most of the time I would just disregard that thought and just repent. Except a few days ago, where after I sinned I worried if I had made a vow to quit my hobbies (playing basketball, going to the gym, playing video games, making friends and hanging out with them, and going to church)  if I fell to that sin, even though I do not remember doing so. Before you ask, no I absolutely did not say anything out loud, nor did I even try resist the sin so there was no logical reason to make a vow like that  anyways. But my mind just clings onto “what if you made a vow but you forgot about it seconds later because you are more focused on committing the sin?” But even that wouldn’t make sense, because I take vows very seriously now and I would almost definitely remember if I made one. I have a very irrational fear of making vows, or made vows I forgot about. I feel like I need to write it down on a notepad just to remind myself not to make vows. Or even make a checklist that says “I did not make a vow today” just to make sure I didn’t. Do any of you have advice on what I should do?

969,"OCD can be a huge obstacle in some aspects of our lives and take away the freedom to do some things that other people can.

I have contamination OCD, and it obviously prevents me from doing many physical things in real life. I’d spend the time I waste on washing and cleaning on more productive things and my hobbies. I’d go to the gym, join a dance club, hang out more often, have more physical contact with my family and loved ones, study more, work on my life plans, and get a part time job.

What about you?",OCD
970,"I’ve battled this disease (contamination ocd specifically) and won several times, gotten to the point where I can use public restrooms, go to work, hang out with friends, and do several social activities. But my mind will always be locked in a constant battle to forget these triggers. There’s certain clothes I’m scared to wear cuz I’ll “contaminate” them. Every so often I’m basically in a mental battle between choosing whether to ignore triggers and deal with the exhaustion and fallout of the gross images that flash in my head, or succumb to them and place yet another molehill, even mountain, in the path to my recovery, for the sake of 5 minutes of peace.

I didn’t always used to be this way. I don’t know what happened. Maybe the stress of coming to terms with the fact that I grew up in a dysfunctional, unsanitary household caused this. All of my triggers surround the feeling of “grossness” rather than the feeling of danger - most traditional exposure therapy won’t work on me because I’m not inherently “afraid” of germs, I just feel the urge to freeze and even feel nauseous when I’m contaminated. Almost like being assaulted/physically violated…except it’s with germs.

I’ve resigned myself to the fact that future partners won’t want to put up with my bullshit. I’ve resigned to the fact that I need to hide my worst symptoms from friends, relatives, family, and employers for the rest of my life. We live in an actively traumatizing world right now, what with a lot of our daily rights and opportunities being taken away under the current administration all while it’s getting more expensive to live decently. I don’t have a space to heal. I don’t have the time to heal. Healing is bullshit anyway, I’ll have a few good months then be right back where I started. 

There’s no way out for me. If I could have a different brain, a less obsessive one, even if it meant I was less “gifted” artistically and academically, I would. If I could trade lives with some of my more “mediocre” yet content classmates growing up, who certainly are nowhere near as mentally ill as I am, I would. I don’t see a permanent path into recovery. I don’t see a future where I am able to live normally without so much mental space dedicated to dealing with being triggered and hiding them from others. This is as “good as it’s going to get” before it’s downhill from here. ",OCD
971,"I was so nervous about starting medication because one of my themes is developing serious illnesses from prescription medication. But omg? 
I didn’t realize how stressed out and angry I was on a daily basis. I’m so calm and stable now. A big worry of mine was not wanting to become a zombie but I can still feel emotions, it’s just now my emotions are usually positive. When I do get bad thoughts, my brain immediately moves on and I don’t ruminate in the possible meanings. 
When something sad happens, I can still very much feel sad, but now it’s not such a dramatic and overwhelming sadness that makes me want to die. I can just feel sadness in a very thoughtful way, and then I can move on. 
Granted I am a bit more watered down and mellow, but not in a zombie way. I still have the same personality, but the mean and negative parts are mostly gone. 
I feel much more present and not like I’m just on auto pilot. It helped my maladaptive daydreaming TREMENDOUSLY. 
The best thing to come out of taking this medication is that I finally see a future for myself. I always thought that it didn’t matter what I did, because I would always be unhappy.  Now, I can imagine a future where I am truly happy and not running from anything. 
Please don’t be scared of taking medication if your doctors think you need it. Sometimes our brain really does need some extra support outside of therapy.

976,"Hi, 28F here! I've been dealing with bouts of ocd since I was 17. The first time it happened, it lasted from April til August. Second time was a month, third was a couple months, so on so forth. The older I got, the less severe it became; the episodes were so spaced out. I haven't had one since 2022, and my life got better after. I met my husband, got married, and was mostly fine for 2 years.

My episodes always seem to happen during extreme stress. I lost a friend to an illness earlier this month, and my husband was dealing with his own health issues :/

Just wondering how common this is? I knew it was still there, but my OCD/anxiety was so easy to dismiss that I didn't care. I'm back to poor sleep if I get any, constant ruminating, intrusive thoughts & being really anxious all the time. :(

I know confessing is not helpful but the image will not stop replaying in my head and it's feeding into existing obsessions I have about being a terrible person and some support could be really helpful i think.

Last night I was walking along a footpath next to a wire fence that separated the path from a train station platform. Someone was sitting alone on the platform really heavily sobbing. I paused for a second and walked a bit closer to the fence and asked if they were okay and if I could do anything and there was no response. I didn't know what to do so I stood there for a few seconds looking at them trying to figure out what to do and they froze up kinda recoiled and started suppressing their sobbing. I stayed there for another few seconds and said Im not sure whats going on but I hope that you're alright as i left.

This was really stupid of me I should've been aware of the fact that that encounter would have been really scary for them especially considering and I probably made it significantly worse by standing there for a few seconds too long I feel absolutely awful. I can't blame them for being scared at all I should've just left them alone but it's absolutely destroying me that they likely see that interaction as one that could've been ill-intentioned. 

I can try and learn from this but the feeling you get from someone being visibly afraid of you like that is genuinely haunting

981,"Hi all, 

  
This is my first post ever on Reddit and it is 1:37 AM.  I wanted to write this as a therapeutic exercise but more importantly to receive some advice.  Im a 26 (M) who has had OCD about illness my entire life.  I remember it being the worst and leading to significant panic when I was from the ages of 10-15.  I then had 3 years of relative peace until I had a stroke at the age of 18 due to a AVM in my lung.  

After the stroke, that took over my OCD around illness.  It happened in a class room during an AP exam. All throughout college it was a major battle for me to get through it.    It has been 7 years since it happened and my illness OCD has creeped back in.  I'm always worried about being sick but for some reason emetophobia and the fear of catching a norovirus is tormenting me.  Even writing it sounds pathetic considering I drink and have thrown up from drinking at least 15 times and have had a stomach virus before.  

  
This is not very linear, but this fear and OCD thought pattern around throwing up began when I was at summer camp in 2012 and there was a norovirus that infected 75% of the staff and campers and I was one of 2 people out of 16 in my cabin who didn't get it.  I took massive precautions that summer I'll never forget it.  

  
Now for some odd reason it is back with vegence, I periodically take .25mg of Xanax to ease my mind and that helps but over the last year plus I've been taking them probably twice a week given the hike.  This also doesn't help my OCD because I am terrified of becoming addicted and having this b a negative feedback loop. 

  
I sit here shaking, I know catching a stomach bug is what it is and I can rationalize it.  But my thoughts that surround the notion are so intrusive and relentless I don't know who to turn too anymore. 

  
Please provide any context you cna to help me settle this. 

  
thank you <3

983,"I (21F) made a very regretful decision to lose my virginity just before getting with my current partner. I was incredibly insecure and decided I needed to rip the Band aid off before committing to the person I wanted to be vulnerable with. It became incredibly regretful because my virginity meant everything to me and it was, in hindsight all wrong. The person was far older, I pressured myself into it, it wasn’t happy romantic or anything I wanted it to be. 

 It was my dream and my obsession since I started to become aware of having sexual desires. I was always a strange kid and didn’t believe I would be really desired by anyone. So my current partner and I get together and things go far far better than I could have ever anticipated. I fell head over heels. We started talking about marriage and kids really early on and planned out a whole future together. My dream was complete, the love of my life, the family I had always wanted. I had never expected to be the one and done kind of girl! 

Which is exactly the problem. I became fixated on the fact that it would never be one clean slate. That we would get married and I would always know I made a mistake before we got together. That I would be thinking about how I was with someone else on our wedding night. That it could have been perfect but I made the wrong choice. Nasty stuff. At a year and a half later I still think about it all the time. Getting flashbacks to that night. Ruminating on things not getting better. Never being able to forget. It’s either an abrupt confrontation with the memory or trying to think my way through the problem. What would you recommend to help get past the rumination and to help with the feelings of disgust?

990,"There has been an increase in the number of posts of individuals who are feeling suicidal. And to be perfectly honest, most of us have been isolated, scared, lonely, and there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world due to COVID.

Unfortunately, most of us in this community are not trained to handle mental health crises. While I and a handful of others are licensed professionals, an anonymous internet forum is not the best place to really provide the correct amount of help and support you need.

That being said, I’m not surprised that many of us in this community are struggling. For those who are struggling, you are not alone. I may be doing well now, but I have two attempts and OCD was a huge factor.

I have never regretted being stopped.

Since you are thinking of posting for help, you won't regret stopping yourself.

So, right now everything seems dark and you don’t see a way out. That’s ok. However, I guarantee you there is a light. Your eyes just have not adjusted yet.

So what can you do in this moment when everything just seems awful.

First off, if you have a plan and you intend on carrying out that plan, I very strongly suggest going to your nearest ER. If you do not feel like you can keep yourself safe, you need to be somewhere where others can keep you safe. Psych hospitals are not wonderful places, they can be scary and frustrating. but you will be around to leave the hospital and get yourself moving in a better direction.

If you are not actively planning to suicide but the thought is very loud and prominent in your head, let's start with some basics. When’s the last time you had food or water? Actual food; something with vegetables, grains, and protein. If you can’t remember or it’s been more than 4 to 5 hours, eat something and drink some water. Your brain cannot work if it does not have fuel.

Next, are you supposed to be sleeping right now? If the answer is yes go to bed. Turn on some soothing music or ambient sounds so that you can focus on the noise and the sounds rather than ruminating about how bad you feel.

If you can’t sleep, try progressive muscle relaxation or some breathing exercises. Have your brain focus on a scene that you find relaxing such as sitting on a beach and watching the waves rolling in or sitting by a brook and listening to the water. Go through each of your five senses and visualize as well as imagine what your senses would be feeling if you were in that space.

If you’re hydrated, fed, and properly rested, ask yourself these questions when is the last time you talked to an actual human being? And I do mean talking as in heard their actual voice. Phone calls count for this one. If it’s been a while. Call someone. It doesn’t matter who, just talk to an actual human being.

Go outside. Get in nature. This actually has research behind it. There is a bacteria or chemical in soil that also happens to be in the air that has mood boosting properties. There are literally countries where doctors will prescribe going for a walk in the woods to their patients.

When is the last time you did something creative? If depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder have gotten in the way of doing creative things that you love, pull out that sketchbook or that camera and just start doing things.

When’s the last time you did something kind for another human being? This may just be me as a social worker, but doing things for others, helps me feel better. So figure out a place you can volunteer and go do it.

When is the last time that you did something pleasurable just for pleasure's sake? Read a book take a bath. You will have to force yourself to do something but that’s OK.

You have worth and you can get through this. Like I said I have had two attempts and now I am a licensed social worker. Things do get better, you just have to get through the dark stuff first.

You will be ok and you can make it through this.

We are all rooting for you.

1172,"Here's a good article about this. https://adaa.org/learn-from-us/from-the-experts/blog-posts/consumer/ocd-physical-sensations-and-urges

A common fearful experience expressed by people with OCD is that their thoughts have somehow evolved and they're no longer afraid of the possibility of some unwanted thing, but instead absolutely certain that the thing is 100% true and they were just in denial and lying to themselves all along. This is often provoked by some sort of physical sensation, urge, or feeling that emerged after the start of the OCD theme.

A lot of people conceive of OCD as only intrusive thoughts, rumination, and ""what if"" questions. This is far from the truth. The article I linked details a case of somatic OCD where the person was experiencing a genuine sensation that they needed to urinate at many times throughout the night, every night. After being referred to an OCD specialist and undergoing a course of ERP, the person learned to tolerate these feelings and the uncertainty around them, and the feelings lost their power and gradually dissipated over time. However, that didn't stop it from feeling 100% real in the moment, and the patient had spent considerable time and effort seeking out urologists to figure out and solve their problem.

I can speak from personal experience on this too. When I had what I now believe was somatic OCD about swallowing a couple years ago, it genuinely felt like every single bite was almost getting stuck in my throat. I agonized over it for weeks, convinced myself I either had an esophageal inflammation or some sort of precancerous growth, and eventually went to a GI specialist and got diagnosed with dysphagia. I went to a surgeon and got an endoscopy to identify the issue, and they found nothing obstructive or otherwise bad in the esophagus; only mild acid buildup in my stomach, something I've been dealing with on and off my whole life without any previous swallowing issues. I didn't know this was OCD at the time; I didn't realize I had OCD until my TOCD developed soon afterward and I did some research. If I had, I could have done a more appropriate course of treatment instead of spending nearly $1000 on pointless medical work in a foreign country I was visiting where I didn't speak the language.

*This isn't limited to somatic OCD either.* People with HOCD and POCD commonly experience false attractions that feel completely real in the moment. People with TOCD commonly experience false feelings of gender envy and/or dysphoria that feel completely real in the moment. I have experienced all of these things and more. 

In my experience, false feelings are much much harder to habituate to than intrusive thoughts. Where the intrusive thoughts create uncertainty, the false feelings 100% convince me that the feared thing is true, and send me into a disastrous spiral that usually lasts until the feelings go away for awhile. I'm still working on techniques to combat this, but I just found [this article](https://www.manhattancbt.com/hocd/) that, while focused on HOCD, includes some universally applicable advice on how to create uncertainty in moments you're 100% convinced that the feared thing is true (CTRL-F ""Lloyd Christmas""). For example, when I'm 100% convinced I'm trans and in denial, usually when the false feelings are hitting hard, I can use these techniques to create a 20% possibility in my mind that I'm not trans and it's just the OCD acting up. Doing this too much can turn into harmful reassurance, but when you're stuck at the bottom of a huge downward spiral it can be a big help.

Remember that no matter how scary and real it feels, you are not the only one who's been through it, you are not alone, and you are more than your thoughts.",OCD
1182,"Hey - you, the stranger reading this. I just wanted to tell you that you are doing better than you think.

This condition is brutal. You are amazing for fighting. Things can change on a dime for the better, healing is possible, and hope springs perpetually. This isn't the end. This will pass.

Give yourself a pat on the back. You are living with one of the most cruel and confusing brain ailments known to humankind. It's torturous...and look at you. You're still here, trying to make a life for yourself. Amazing. 

You will be okay - maybe incredible. Some time from now, with patience and a little work, the OCD might go from a mountain to a pebble. Or even a grain of sand. It may even vanish altogether. 

This isn't hopeless. We are all suffering, but we are fighters, and we're in this together. Keep going, keep the faith, keep kicking ass. This fight is NOT fucking over and we will not stand for this. We WILL find solutions.

1219,"Hi! I recently got diagnosed and am still trying to figure everything out and make sense of all this. What were things you didn’t realize were your OCD? Here’s what I’ve noticed for myself:

- repeating things over and over in my head (specifically when I was younger and praying)

- having to even out sensations on both sides of my body so that it’s even 

- not liking a post if it’s on a “bad” number or turning up the tv so it’s on a good/ safe number

- checking my texts because I always feel like I sent someone something inappropriate or wrong

- thinking I’m a liar and having to rationalize it or get reassurance/ confess 

- making a wish at 11:11 or 2:22

- if someone doesn’t respond/ come soon enough I think that they died and I have to check on them or else they will die

That doesn't make sense."" I have to explain to them that the sick part of OCD is, as we all know, we *do* know that the rituals aren't connected to our obsessions but we feel compelled to do them anyway. 

When I see a news story about a rare disease I may have risk factors for and worry I might get it and it might ruin my life, I know the rational response is ""I don't have that disease right now and I can't control if I get it, so the best thing to do is just relax and worry about it if I get it."" But I still worry about it and do mental compulsions trying to convince myself I won't get it incessantly. When I have a memory of an old fight with a friend from years ago and worry I'm a bad person, I know the rational response is ""It was years ago, it makes no difference now, just forget it."" But I still endlessly look for reassurances I didn't do anything wrong and my friend doesn't have bad memories of me.

This is what I keep telling myself, when the really nasty thoughts pop up. ""This thought disgusts me, therefore it doesn't describe me"".

1394,"Hey, take a seat, take some hot coffee or tea or whatever you like, and just give yourself a breather for once. Even if it‘s just for the time being of reading this post. 

My heart breaks for each and every single one of you. Myself included. It‘s not your fault, you‘re not a bad person. You don‘t need to carry this guilt. You have nothing to be afraid of, i promise. You are capable, and i‘m so proud of you for not giving up. 

It‘s easy to forget what this disorder is actually doing to us, because we are so focused on our worries, fears, and the consequences that OCD tells us comes with not worrying about it. OCD is so vile and wretched, it tricks us into spending all this time and energy on preventing our worst fears. It tricks us into thinking we are evil and heartless if we dont, that it‘s our fault and therefore we must sacrifice our entire life bending to it‘s rules. That is the exact goal of this disorder, it makes it possible so we don‘t realize what kind of actual torture we are putting ourselves through. If we never come to see the gravity of that, we will keep obeying, keep allowing OCD‘s grasp of control. That way we will never break free. 

Meanwhile what is ACTUALLY happening, is that you, my dear fellow soul, are destroying yourself. You are robbing yourself of your own life slowly. You are abandoning yourself a little bit every time you trust OCD‘s words more, than your own.

I know it‘s hard to not fall into believing OCD‘s lies, and I know it feels so real. I know you‘re afraid. I am too. But if i can give you one thing on your journey.. remember all of this is the only thing that allows OCD to keep you in the cycle. View OCD as a toxic partner if it helps you. OCD is manipulating you constantly so you keep being too afraid to set boundaries and cut the toxicity out of your life. to keep you controlled. 

Your wellbeing, YOU as a person, YOUR life, is more important than whatever OCD is telling you. Allow yourself to let go. You don‘t need to solve your obession. You don‘t need to figure it out. I promise it‘s possible to feel better WITHOUT knowing. It‘s possible to get your life back my dear. ERP helps and is gonna be your best starting point. I believe in you. Don‘t give up on yourself, you deserve to live and experience joy without guilt and fear. ",OCD

1428,"One of the most important things I've learned (and often don't remember) about OCD is that the content /theme is irrelevant. It's a misfiring signal from your brain that is sending the thoughts and your reaction to this is the problem.

You might have contamination OCD and get the thought that you've got germs on your hands, even after washing them 20 times. Another person might have scrupulosity and say the same prayer 50 times to try and get it right. It doesn't matter what the theme is, it's all a misfiring of the brain, and our erroneous reactions to these misfirings that is the real problem.

I often catch myself spending maybe hours trying to solve a problem, which when ""resolved"" just generates another. If, every time, I remembered that the content is irrelevant, and just lived with the uncertainty, fear, etc, this would eventually show my brain that bad things aren't gonna happen and I can just continue with my day

OCD is like dominoes. You  knock down one (compulsion) and end up setting off a chain reaction. This can lead to an obsessive loop and feelings of emptiness, depression etc.

I want to focus on just letting the thoughts be there, whatever the content, because the content doesn't matter. This way I hope to fix my broken brain",OCD

The compulsion (also referred to as a ritual) is going back to check. In this example the person can’t shake it off and will constantly be thinking about the chance their car is unlocked. From there thoughts will spiral and catastropize into “someone will break in and steal my things/my car” “I can’t afford a new car to replace the stolen one” and so on all with varying degree of “if I don’t go back and do the ritual then X bad things are going to happen.”",OCD

When the thoughts hit they just cycle and cycle around my brain and I find it so hard to function because what's the point in doing anything if my life will eventually be ruined for things I regret doing? I have to go through all of these compulsive behaviors like Googling my name to see if anything bad comes up and seeking reassurance from loved ones just to feel slightly better, and even then the fear still remains a bit. 

Am I totally alone in feeling this way, or have other people experienced it to? If so, how did you manage to overcome it?",OCD

1612,"Imagine your brain is a computer (which it is), and it was corrupted with a virus (your OCD). 

Obsessive and intrusive thoughts are like unwanted pop ups appearing all over the screen whenever you’re trying to get things done like work or simply relax by watching a movie. 

The compulsions are essentially you clicking off the pop ups but every time you close one another two appear exacerbating the problem. However OCD has conditioned you to think that closing the pop up is the solution to your problems so it becomes a self sufficient cycle. 

The best way to combat this is by not reacting to the thoughts because they aren’t you. Or by downloading antivirus software (prescribed medication or therapy ahaha). However ultimately what you have to remember is that your thoughts don’t define you, the same way the virus isn’t the fault of your computer. 

Feel free to make any additions or changes to this, I just thought people might resonate with it. If this helps at least one person then my day’s been made :) stay safe people.

TLDR: Your brain’s a computer, OCD is a virus, every obsession is a pop up, every click of the “X” is a compulsion. You need to deal with the root of the problem not the symptoms :)

1708,"Hi everyone, 

I’m making a children’s book about OCD. For context, I’m a play therapist and want to create media for kids to better understand themselves (and also to help parents understand the impact of OCD).

What are some mental compulsions you did as a kid that others didn’t notice or just dismissed as a “kid’s quirk”? And that maybe even you didn’t notice was OCD until you were older because you had no reference point; you thought it was just human and “normal”.

Especially for moral scrupulosity and just right (as in it having to feel just right or saying something just right) OCD. 

I’ll go first if this helps: I remember as a kid, I had the urge to confess because if I didn’t, it didn’t feel right, and it felt like I was being a bad kid hiding things from my parents (even though what I thought I was hiding was just ""normal"" child thoughts and questions). 

Edit: grammar mistakes

Edit 2: I want to add another compulsion I just remembered after reading people's responses.
I would sit and try to memorize everything about a specific moment that felt important, whether it was objective important or not, I would. memorize how I felt how the temperature felt, the colours of what I was seeing, shapes, the smells, how my skin felt, and it goes on and on. Some of these memories are still with me. AND I would go back to them over and over to ""keep them freesh"" and ""stop them from fading."" I would also do this as an adult a few years ago. Never knew it was OCD until recently.

(Also, so cool to see everyone respond, my inner child and current adult feels very comforted and seen. I hope this helps you too :-) ) ",OCD
1710,"Spending nearly all your waking hours obsessing over social mistakes, unable to process them like others, will lead to an inferiority complex. Inevitably you’ll see only your flaws and the grand catastrophes caused by your actions, and question if you have any worth. 

Then you lose touch with reality by obsessing about potential solutions to your social problems and pulling your hair out when they fail. Slowly your perceptions get distorted, your sense of normalcy declines and all you can do is charge forward like a battering ram.

Then you realize the mistakes you made, real event and false memory close in on you and now you have another problem on your hands. One that makes you feel deep, deep shame. And now you have real proof of it. 

Beyond any specific obsessions or compulsions, your relationship to the world becomes all about solving. There’s always an emergency and your mind is constantly trained on anxiety and solving.

when does it go away?? when does my mind stop screaming at me that i’m “hiding something” from my gf if i don’t confess each and every single one of the bad thoughts that have popped up in my head even though i don’t like them and they don’t align with my values or they’re just straight up intrusive? i’d give anything to be normal again and be able to brush off thoughts i don’t like or agree with and move on with my day instead of my mind fixating on them and making me feel like a horrible person even though i’m not.

the ONLY moments of calm i’ve been able to get lately is when me and my gf call and hang out but funny enough my confession ocd revolves around her and my brain being anxious about what she’d think of if she knew the kind of things that popped up in my head but for fucks sake she literally said that i shouldn’t tell her or anyone my intrusive thoughts and that i don’t have to confess to her!! so i’m trying to listen to her on that because i love her and i’m loyal and she’s genuinely the person i wanna spend my life with so i try to disregard any bad or intrusive thoughts i’ve had since i don’t feel like those represent me and i try to label them as intrusive

Taking away that fear of having them will take away the stress and anxiety, making them easier to deal with. 

When regretting the past and feeling guilty, the best way to think is that at the time you didn't know how it would affect you later. I was feeling guilty about something I did when I was 13.

At that point the compulsion idea became so long and demanding... disinfecting my phone, washing all the bed sheets and a loooong shower.

So I just said fuck it I'm not doing this crap. And I went to my PC to get back to doing my job again after 2 weeks of sick leave.

I knew that since I had touched a bunch of things since my obsession started, at some point everything would become contaminated at which point my OCD would either give up or I would go into a cleaning frenzy.

OCD Acceptance Script

I acknowledge that OCD is a part of my life, but it does not define who I am. It's one aspect of my complex self, and while it presents challenges, it also offers me unique insights into resilience, strength, and the human experience.

OCD brings with it intrusive thoughts, urges, and doubts. These can be intense and difficult to manage, but today, I choose to accept these experiences without judgment. Acceptance means seeing these thoughts for what they are: symptoms of my condition, not reflections of my character or desires.

I understand that fighting or resisting my OCD thoughts and feelings often gives them more power. Instead, I'll practice accepting their presence, knowing that acceptance is the first step in reducing their impact on my life. This doesn't mean I won't work to manage my OCD, but I will do so from a place of understanding and compassion, rather than fear or frustration.

With acceptance comes the willingness to seek help and support. I am open to therapy, to learning strategies like Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), and to connecting with others who share similar experiences. I know that by embracing evidence-based treatments and community support, I can live a fulfilling life, even with OCD.

I also accept that progress may be slow and non-linear. There will be good days and challenging ones. I commit to treating myself with kindness and patience, celebrating my victories, no matter how small, and forgiving myself when things don't go as planned.

I recognize the importance of focusing on what I value and love, allowing those things to guide my actions and decisions, rather than my fears or compulsions. My values are my compass, leading me toward a life of meaning, even amidst uncertainty.

Today, I pledge to practice self-compassion, to remind myself that I am doing my best, and to remember that I am not alone in this journey. There is hope, and there is help. By accepting my OCD, I take an important step towards empowerment and healing.

I am more than my OCD. I am capable, resilient, and worthy of a joyful, purposeful life. With acceptance as my foundation, I move forward with courage and hope.",OCD

Danger is always real but fear is always a choice. We can’t control what happens in life or in the future, it’s part of where fear stems from. But we can control how we react to them. Acceptance is the root of healing. Accept what you fear may happen but also may not. Accept what you fear did happen and accept that you can’t change the past. Accept that you have no control over what you don’t know and learn to let go. It is possible as impossible as it seems and I am proof of that.

Background for those interested:

I bought a bag of locally-made candy a few weeks ago & when I read the ""Our Story"" blurb on the back of the bag, they described themselves as ""a bit OCD"" since they make their candy in a very clean & organized way. I was immediately so disheartened & sad & it was just a huge reminder that people really don't understand OCD. They also had the same ""Our Story"" blurb using OCD incorrectly on their website.

I really wanted to bring it to their attention but I was worried about how they would respond & what I would even say to try to not be confrontational. Then I saw Alegra's post giving a script on what to say to those who use OCD incorrectly, & I decided to just go for it. I messaged them & mostly followed the script, but also mentioned that they need to change the wording on their website & packaging to stop contributing towards harmful stereotypes.

They finally responded this morning & they were extremely apologetic, & they changed the wording on their website & let me know that their next order & all future orders will have the packaging changed as well.

Although I found that analogy useful, it didn't address where my intrusive thoughts came from, or why I was getting those 'e-mails' on those particular subjects so often.

Now that I have overcome my OCD, I realize that I had not only been reading and believing the spam that I received, but I had been responding to them too, actively engaging with the sender on the subjects. And as everybody knows, that's about the worst thing you can do.

1841,"Hello! Just a little reminder to not solve the thoughts! Don’t try to get the right feeling, and then move on!

There are 2 ways you can go about this...

1. You solve the thought, then get another thought. Then you solve that one and get another. And so on...
Or...
2. You keep this thought and acknowledge that it’s there but you don’t engage in it. You’ll have this thought following you for a while until the OCD grows bored and moves on to a different thought.

If you keep trying to solve the thoughts, you’re telling your brain that this is important and in turn, your brain will continue to send you similar thoughts so you can keep solving them.

Your brain loves to solve things! But there are some things that you can’t or don’t even NEED to solve!

Even if you solve the thought, the next thought will bring you just as much anxiety, so the anxiety will be equal no matter what! Content doesn’t matter. Even when you feel like you’ve solved all the thoughts and there’s not a thought that your brain can come up with at the moment, your brain is actively trying to come up with something to bring you anxiety. Just keep whatever thought you have until it grows bored and moves on. That way, you’re telling your brain that this is not important.

1851,"Hey, you. Yes, I'm talking to you. You are probably scrolling through reddit searching for reassurance because of a ""bad"" thought or emotion you had, or because you are afraid you did something horrible, or because you think your identity as a person is hanging in the balance. You feel like you will have to sit here for the next multiple hours, ruminating and ruminating and ruminating, looking for answers that aren't there. You feel like you shouldn't do anything else until you figure this out.

But here's the truth: you are not obligated to figure this out. 

I know that your OCD is whispering in your ear, telling you that you MUST prove to yourself that you didn't think the ""bad"" thought ""on purpose, or that it wasn't a ""genuine"" feeling, or that what you did wasn't actually bad. It is telling you that you are its prisoner, and that you are serving time for how horrible you are, that you can't leave the cage until your innocence is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 

But your OCD is lying to you.

You are NOT morally obligated to figure out the answers to these obsessive questions. There is nothing bad that will happen if you say, ""maybe yes, maybe no"" and move on with your day. Read a book. Go on a run. Do the dishes. Make a meal. Just do anything besides what your OCD is telling you that you must do. 

I know that you don't enjoy ruminating for hours. Nobody does. It is miserable. But there are things that you do enjoy. If you feel like you can't enjoy anything, there are certainly things to do that are a lot less miserable than obsessive rumination. 

And right now, you are probably going to say, ""I know I don't enjoy ruminating, but I *need* to figure out whether this is true!""

Who says?

Your OCD does.

But the questions it wants you to ask yourself are irrelevant. There are outward things to do right now, for the good of yourself and for the good of others.

Ruminating doesn't make you happy. It doesn't help anyone else. Right now, tell yourself, ""I don't know, and that's ok."" Then go do somethin else. It will be very liberating.",OCD

1892,"These 10 things helped me so much to overcome my OCD after years of pure HELL with this disorder ruining my life. I hope this helps you as well!

## 1. OCD is chronic

This means it is like having asthma or diabetes. You can get it under control and become recovered but, at the present time, there is no cure. It is a potential that will always be there in the background, even if it is no longer affecting your life.  The current thinking is that it is probably genetic in origin, and not within our current reach to treat at that level. The things you will have to do to treat it really control, and if you don’t learn to effectively make use of them throughout your life, you will run the risk of relapse. This means that if you don’t use the tools provided in cognitive/behavioral therapy or if you stop taking your medication (in most cases) you will soon find yourself hemmed in by symptoms once again.

## 2. Two of the main features of OCD are doubt and guilt

While it is not understood why this is so, these are considered hallmarks of the disorder.  Unless you understand these, you cannot understand OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as the “doubting disease.”  OCD can make a sufferer doubt even the most basic things about themselves, others, or the world they live in.  I have seen patients doubt their sexuality, their sanity, their perceptions, whether or not they are responsible for the safety of total strangers, the likelihood that they will become murderers, etc.  I have even seen patients have doubts about whether they were actually alive or not.  Doubt is one of the more maddening qualities of OCD.  It can override even the keenest intelligence.  It is a doubt that cannot be quenched.  It is doubt raised to the highest power. It is what causes sufferers to check things hundreds of times, or to ask endless questions of themselves or others.  Even when an answer is found, it may only stick for several minutes, only to slip away as if it was never there.  Only when sufferers recognize the futility of trying to resolve this doubt, can they begin to make progress.

The guilt is another excruciating part of the disorder. It is rather easy to make people with OCD feel guilty about most anything, as many of them already have a surplus of it.  They often feel responsible for things that no one would ever take upon themselves

## 3. Although you can resist performing a compulsion, you cannot refuse to think an obsessive thought

Obsessions are biochemically generated mental events that seem to resemble one’s own real thoughts, but aren’t.  One of my patients used to refer to them as “My synthetic thoughts.”  They are as counterfeit bills are to real ones, or as wax fruit is to real fruit.  As biochemical events, they cannot simply be shut off at will.  Studies in thought suppression have shown that the more you try to not think about something, the more you will end up thinking about it paradoxically. The real trick to dealing with obsessions I like to tell my patients is, “If you want to think about it less, think about it more.”  Neither can you run from or avoid the fears resulting from your obsessions.  Fear, too, originates in the mind, and in order to recover, it is important to accept that there is no escape.  Fears must be confronted.  People with OCD do not stay with the things they fear long enough to learn the truth–that is, that their fears are unjustified and that the anxiety would have gone away anyway on its own, without a compulsion or neutralizing activity.

## 4. Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy is the best form of treatment for OCD

Cognitive/Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered to be the best form of treatment for OCD.  OCD is believed to be a genetically-based problem with behavioral components, and not psychological in origin.  Ordinary talk therapy will, therefore, not be of much help. Reviewing past events in your life, or trying to figure out where your parents went wrong in raising you have never been shown to relieve the symptoms of OCD.  Other forms of behavioral treatment, such as relaxation training or thought-stopping (snapping a rubber band against your wrist and saying the word “Stop” to yourself when you get an obsessive thought) are likewise unhelpful.  The type of behavioral therapy shown to be most effective for OCD is known as Exposure and Response Prevention (E&RP).

E&RP consists of gradually confronting your fearful thoughts and situations while resisting the performing of compulsions.  The goal is to stay with whatever makes you anxious so that you will develop a tolerance for the thought or the situation, and learn that, if you take no protective measures, nothing at all will happen. People with OCD do not stay long enough in feared situations to learn the truth.  I try to get my patients to stay with fearful things to the point where a kind of fatigue with the subject sets in.  Our goal is to wear the thought out.  I tell them, “You cant be bored and scared at the same time.” Compulsions, too, are part of the system and must be eliminated for the recovery process to occur.  There are two things that tend to sustain compulsions.  One is that by doing them, the sufferer is only further convinced of the reality of their obsessions, and is then driven to do more compulsions.  The other is that habit also keeps some people doing compulsions, sometimes long after the point of doing them is forgotten. The cognitive component of CBT teaches you to question the probability of your fears actually coming true (always very low or practically nil), and to challenge their underlying logic (always irrational and sometimes even bizarre).

## 5. While medication is a help, it is not a complete treatment in itself

It is human nature to always want quick, easy, and simple solutions to life’s problems.  While everyone with OCD would like there to be a magical medicinal bullet to take away their symptoms, there really is no such thing at this time.  Meds are not the “perfect” treatment; however, they are a “pretty good” treatment.  Generally speaking, if you can get a reduction in your symptoms of from 60 to 70 percent, it is considered a good result.  Of course, there are always those few who can say that their symptoms were completely relieved by a particular drug.  They are the exception rather than the rule.  People are always asking me, “What is the best drug for OCD?”  My answer is, “The one that works best for you.”  I have a saying about meds:  “Everything works for somebody, but nothing works for everybody.”  Just because a particular drug worked for someone you know, does not mean that it will work for you.

Relying solely on meds most likely means that all your symptoms will not be relieved and that you will always be vulnerable to a substantial relapse if you discontinue them.  Discontinuation studies (where those who have only had meds agreed to give them up) have demonstrated extremely high rates of relapse.  This is because drugs are not a cure, but are rather a control.  Even where they are working well, when you stop taking them, your chemistry will soon revert (usually within a few weeks) to its former unhealthy state.  Meds are extremely useful as part of a comprehensive treatment together with CBT. They should, in fact, be regarded as a tool to help you to do therapy. They give you an edge by reducing levels of obsession and anxiety.  While those with mild OCD can frequently recover without the use of meds, the majority of sufferers will need them in order to be successful.  One unfortunate problem with meds is the stigma attached to them.  Having to use them does not mean that you are weaker than others, only that this is what your particular chemistry requires for you to be successful. You cant always fight your own brain chemistry unaided.  Using psychiatric drugs also does not mean that you are “crazy.” People with OCD are not crazy, delusional, or disoriented. When relieved of their symptoms, they are just as functional as anyone.

## 6. You cannot and should not depend upon the help of others to manage your anxiety or to get well

To begin with, and most obviously, you are always with you. If you come to depend upon others to manage your anxiety by reassuring you, answering your questions, touching things for you, or taking part in your rituals, what will you do when they are not around?  My guess is that you will likely be immobilized and helpless. The same is true if you only work on your therapy homework when others are nagging or reminding you. No one can want you to recover more than you do. If your motivation is so poor that you cannot get going on your own (assuming that you are not also suffering from an untreated case of depression), then you will have learned nothing about what it takes to recover from OCD.  As mentioned at the beginning, since OCD is chronic, you will have to learn to manage it throughout your life.  Since you can find yourself on your own at any point, unpredictably, you will always need to be fully independent in managing it.

## 7. The goal of any good treatment is to teach you to become your own therapist

In line with the last point, good Cognitive/Behavioral treatment should aim to give you the tools necessary to manage your symptoms effectively.  As therapy progresses, the responsibility for directing your treatment should gradually shift from your therapist to you.  Whereas the therapist may start out by giving you assignments designed to help you face and overcome your fears, you should eventually learn to spot difficult situations on your own and give yourself challenging homework to do.  This will then be a model for how you will need to handle things throughout your life.

## 8. You cannot rely upon your own intuition in deciding how to deal with OCD

In using your intuition to deal with what obsessions may be telling you, there is one thing you can always count on: it will always lead you in the wrong direction.  It is only natural to want to escape or avoid that which makes you fearful. It’s instinctive. It really amazes me how common this is. This may be fine when faced by a vicious dog or an angry mugger but, since the fear in OCD results from recurring thoughts inside your head, it cannot be escaped from. The momentary escape from fear that compulsions give fools people into relying upon them.  While compulsions start out as a solution, they soon become the main problem itself as they begin taking over your life. People with OCD never stay with what they fear long enough to find out that what they fear isn’t true. Only by doing the opposite of what instinct tells you will you be able to find this out.

## 9. Getting recovered takes time

How long does it take?  As long as is necessary for a given individual. Speaking from experience, I would say that the average uncomplicated case of OCD takes from about six to twelve months to be successfully completed. If symptoms are severe, if the person works at a slow pace, or if other problems are also present, it can take longer.  Also, some people need to work on the rehabilitation of their lives after the OCD is brought under control.  Long-term OCD can take a heavy toll on a persons ability to live.  It may have been a long time since they have socialized, held a job, or doing everyday household chores, etc. Some people have never done these things. Returning to these activities may add to the time it takes to finish treatment.

However long it takes, it is crucial to see the process through to the finish. There is no such thing as being “partially recovered.”  Those who believe they can take on only those symptoms they feel comfortable facing soon find themselves back at square one. Untreated symptoms have a way of expanding to fill the space left by those that have been relieved.  When explaining this to my patients, I liken it to getting surgery for cancer.  I ask them, “Would you want the surgeon to remove it all, or leave some of it behind?”  Or, put another way, it is not a game you can simply drop out of midway with your winnings and expect to keep them.

## 10. Relapse is a potential risk that must be guarded against

It has always been a favorite saying of mine that, “Getting well is 50 percent of the job, and staying well is the other 50 percent.”  We have actually come full-circle back to Point #1, which tells us that OCD is chronic. This tells us that although there is no cure, you can successfully recover and live a life no different from other people.  Once a person gets to the point of recovery, there are several things that must be observed if they are to stay that way.  As mentioned in Point #7, the goal of proper therapy is to teach people to become their own therapists.  It gives them the tools to accomplish this.  One of these tools is the knowledge that feared situations can no longer be avoided. The overall operating principle is that obsessions must therefore always be confronted immediately, and all compulsions must be resisted.  When people are seen to relapse, it is usually because they avoided an obsessive fear which then got out of hand because they went on to perform compulsions.  Another cause can be an individual believing that they were cured and stopping their medication without telling anyone.  Unfortunately, the brain doesn’t repair itself while on medications, and so when drugs are withdrawn, the chemistry reverts to its former dysfunctional state.  Finally, some people may have fully completed their treatment, but have neglected to tell their therapist about all of their symptoms, or else they did not go as far as they needed to in confronting and overcoming the things they did work on.  In pursuing treatment for OCD, it is vital to go the distance in tackling all of your symptoms, so as to be prepared for whatever you may encounter in the future.

It is vital to remember that no one is perfect, nor can anyone recover perfectly.  Even in well-maintained recoveries, people can occasionally slip up and forget what they are supposed to be doing.  Luckily, there is always another chance to re-expose yourself and so, rather than a person beating themselves up and putting themselves down, they can soon regain their balance if they immediately get back on track by turning again and facing that which is feared, and then not doing compulsions.

Finally, because health is the result of living in a state of balance, it is extremely important, post-therapy, to live a balanced life, with enough sleep, proper diet and exercise, social relationships, and productive work of some type.

1904,"I recently met a new friend and she asked what I was up to this weekend. I mentioned that due to thunderstorms all weekend, I'll be staying home and cleaning up around the house. She responds, ""do you like cleaning? I'm kinda OCD when it comes to keeping my house clean."" I asked if she has been diagnosed with OCD and she responded no, but she deals with anxiety and depression. 

There is nothing more I can't stand is when people throw around mental illness like it's a joke. I want to call her out nicely about it, but I barely know her. How do you respond to this?",OCD
1908,If that makes any sense at all.,OCD
1911,"One of the ways I try to reason with my contamination OCD is ""normal people do this all the time and are fine"". Doesn't always work, but for some small things (like placing an 'outside' item on my bed) it helps a little.

So for a while I've been trying to figure out what, for most people, is the line they draw when it comes to cross contamination. I've been trying to base changing my habits off of ""well, normal people still probably get weird about this thing...""

But the other day I FINALLY realized, normal people straight up don't think about contamination... at all. For most people, washing hands and showering your body is enough to feel clean. People don't feel tense sitting on a couch they sat in earlier in their 'outside' clothes. There is no line because contamination is an afterthought to most people.

I really hope one day I can live like that. It sounds so freaking nice😭
To not think about contamination at all except for hand washing and showering??? I really hope I can live like that one day and recover from this OCD. Thats all",OCD
1914,"Like....you have no control over it. Maybe first it manifests from anxiety, then you get scared that you felt something, and that makes it even more worse and powerful. You try to rationalize it away (which is bad, of course, but who wouldn't?) and oh look at that! Now they're even stronger and more frequent. Now it feels like real arousal. Now it feels like maybe you really DO want it or have some sort of repressed attraction/fetish/whatever. You worry about it more, because how do you ignore such an upsetting sensation happening in your own body? Now there's a mental connection between the response and the trigger, no intrusive thoughts beforehand needed. And now whenever you're around the trigger you get the response because youre afraid of getting it. Your heart beats faster with anxiety and it gets hard to focus or breathe, which makes it feel even more like arousal. You hate it, you absolutely despise the feeling it gives you, you'd kill for it to go away (but what if you like it?)

And then the only way to get rid of it is to face the trigger, to ignore the sensation, no matter how powerful it is, no matter if it feels like you're about to fucking orgasm. For however long it takes to go away. Could be days. Could be weeks. You don't know! And all of this is against your will (but what if you're just lying to yourself.) It's fucking disgusting.",OCD
1919,I was at Joann’s Fabric and I saw a candle that said “Anything you imagine can come true” or something along those lines. I showed it to my friend and said as someone with OCD this sounds like a threat 😂,OCD
1921,Like I will do something nice or “good” and then my brain will be like “you don’t actually care you’re just doing it cause you want to cover up what a bad person you are!” Like how fucked up is that? Ugh!!,OCD
1922,"My husband's OCD has him convince that any and all meats he cooks is poison. The meat is and always under cooked and if he eats it, he will get sick and die.

We are in personal therapy for our own mental problems and couples therapy so we can learn how to help each other.

Being married to someone with OCD is hard. I want to give in and let my husband do his rituals but I can't. So tonight was tough because I always cook because my cooking is ""safe"".

Before we met all he ate was pasta. He has gained 50 pounds since we met due to my hearty homecook meals.

But after food therapy our therapist he HAD to use our airfryer to cook a chicken leg AND eat part of it.

AND I couldn't eat it so he wouldn't have that safe feeling.

It only took 40 minutes for him to overcome his OCD and eat part of a chicken leg. And he didn't get sick and die so he made a SECOND ONE and ate it.

Now he wants to cook with me to learn more meat base dishes.

Major victory tonight in our household. Couldn't be more proud of my husband.",OCD

1936,"Growing up I had two sleep-based obsessions: I could NOT sleep if I was hungry, and I was terrified of wetting the bed.

I ended up creating a ritual every night to manage these obsessions. When I was ready for bed, I would pee, drink a glass of milk, and then wait exactly 5 minutes before peeing once more. Only then could I sleep.

I knew it wasn't necessarily normal but didn't connect the dots until much later in life when I started suspecting I had OCD.",OCD
1937,"This morning I wanted to take my bike out and ride. The weather is clear. And I seldom get the time to. I wanted to up until I got a certain intrusive thought about an obsession not related to bike riding. At that point, j started to fear that if I go and ride my bike, that the experience and act of riding will be contaminated. I also feared that because of that thought being present in my mind and that I will be ruminating, that I will not enjoy riding my bike and that the entire ride will be a waste of time. Even though this may sound irrational, fhe feelings are intensely real. As real as it gets. Has anyone e experienced this before, and if so what did you do to overcome it?",OCD
1939,"This last months have been tough, my OCD got worse and worse especially in quarantine, and I was losing literally like 5 hours each day performing compulsions. But today I managed to go the whole day without doing any of them! Of course, I got a lot of anxiety and the thoughts did not stop, can't avoid them. But if I did it, any one of u guys can do it too! I believe in all of you, we're gonna get through this :)",OCD
1941,"I have a compulsion of eating out of public bins (I know it’s gross and I eat small bites of food that isn’t visibly dirty), it’s due to perfection and completion obsessions. I was caught eating out of a public bin outside of a takeaway by a stranger. She thought I was starving and took me inside and kindly brought food. I couldn’t bring myself to explain myself, so I gratefully accepted a few fries. I look young so the people working in the take away were asking my name and address, likely with an intention to contact social services to report a starving kid eating from bins. I didn’t give them my details, I just told them I was fine and thanked them. This is my lowest moment ",OCD
1942,"Mine is a tie between washing my hair 10 times in one day and trying to throw away 2 perfectly good couches bc I thought they were contaminated. I also just felt bad making people accommodate my weird compulsions and decided to get help.

1943,"I get worried about this sometimes. Hearing other people talk about their OCD and their rituals and intrusive thoughts and it made me worried that I might not have OCD because some of these things I don't do or don't think. But logically speaking I know I have OCD and it doesn't have to match with anybody else's. 

Having fears that you might not actually have/are just faking OCD is actually a very common intrusive thought.  The thing is, OCD tends to target the things that you care about the most. For instance I have ROCD (relationship) because I care a lot about my relationship so I tend to obsess over it/relationships as a whole. I also do have various physical ritual behaviors and number things that are typical with people with OCD. I sometimes get worried because I hear people talk about how they'll constantly check locks to make sure they're closed and things like that and I get worried because I don't do that so I worry I might not have OCD.  In reality though, I honestly don't care about whether or not my doors are locked. I feel safe in my home and live in a low crime area so I almost never lock doors of any kind. Which isn't to say that rationality is a cure for OCD and me thinking rationally prevents me from doing that. After all, OCD thoughts are by nature irrational and have very little foundation in logic. 

What I'm getting at is that if you don't care about something then your OCD is unlikely to target that specific thing. If you don't care about locks, your OCD probably won't make you check them constantly, if you hate your family then you're unlikely to have intrusive thoughts regarding their harm, etc. 

And as for physical rituals go, just because a physical ritual works for someone else doesn't mean it will for you. We all have different rituals for different purposes. Maybe something that makes my hands ""feel even"" might not work the same for someone else and they have to to a different thing, or maybe they have a different ""number"" as you, etc.  When you worry about things like this it becomes another obsession and follows the same patterns as the rest.",OCD
1944,"“Put your hands right next to each other, your hands represent your thoughts. Now cover your face with them, can you see anything, can you focus on what you’re doing? No because your thoughts are blocking your point of view. 

Now move them away from your face by extending your arms. They are still there but now you can see and focus on what you are doing. 

After a while your arms will get tired so you will put your hands down. Your hands are still connected to you even though you don’t see them. Just like your hands your thoughts will never go away nor you can make them, just accept that they are there and let them go and your mind will let them go.”

I don’t know how well I could tell you or if anyone can relate but it helped me and I just wanted to share, hope it helps someone else too

1955,"Like fuck off.
No you don't. Every night, convincing yourself you're the equivalent of Hitler because of your thoughts and worries/past actions. 
Staying in your room sobbing cos you're worried you'll hurt the people you love.
Worrying I can never have my own children in case I'm a danger to them.
Blaming myself for a murder happening or someone going missing because I DIDN'T FLICK THAT LIGHT SWITCH. 
Convinced you're going crazy at every corner...

So no. You don't want this illness. It's not just ""Being tidy"" and you shouldn't be jealous of your friend for having it (she was talking about her friend who had it). 

Honestly. This world disgusts me more and more each day.

1958,"The internet loves to be accepting of mental illness until it is present in way they are not used to. This is exactly why using ""intrusive thoughts"" in a silly way is harmful.

1960,"I've been doing an hour or two of meditation a day and find it to be one of the most effective means of treating OCD. I think the reason more people don't recommend it is because there is a lot of misinformation surrounding the practice.

Meditation does not try to eliminate your thoughts or even relax or calm you. Meditation trains your attention and awareness to increase your overall cognitive ability. With OCD, much of the issue is not your thoughts or obsessions themselves, but rather the attention that you give them.

To train your attention and awareness all you must  do is sit and keep track of the sensations around you and then focus your attention on the sensation of your breath. You will be fighting against distractions and invasive thoughts, but as long as you keep the right intent, you can return to your breath.

In time this practice will give you more active control of your attention in all areas of your life. Intrusive thoughts will not have nearly as much of an effect on you and you will be able to live life with vastly more clarity and mental ability.",OCD

1969,"They say having OCD is like having a handicap.  

Except, one of the hardest parts about it, is other people can't see this handicap.  You suffer alone.  On the inside.

If you were blind, or deaf, or physically disabled, people would go out of their way to open the door, help you, give you space, feel sympathy, whatever you need.  But as it is, if you're at all like me, you've gotten great at hiding it.  And they don't know.  

Nobody notices.  They don't know you are suffering on the inside.  They don't understand the constant battle going on in your mind.  

They might even resent you, or dislike you, because your OCD has made you do strange things around them.  And they blame you.  Which compounds the suffering.

Sending hugs to everyone today who is out there suffering alone.  You are not alone.  There are millions of us out there like you.  

It is your burden, it is also your super power and your opportunity.  Because of this extremely unique gift you've been given, you are better able to understand the pain and suffering of others.

For over a year I’ve been terrified of my meds because my OCD brain said that they’d make me sick (I’m extremely emetophobic)

But tonight, I said fuck it and took them before I could think too much!!

Still extremely anxious because I’ve gone directly against my magical thinking- but goddamn I’m so so proud of myself, dudes!!!!

The thing that pushed me is how much I missed exercise. My reflux has been especially bad since October- and I’ve not been able to run at all or do much exercise since then. I miss it so much. I’m not even super fit- nor was I ever- but exercise makes me feel so good about myself. Plus- I might be joining the volleyball team through my school, and I cannot play if my reflux is as bad as it is now.

intrusive thoughts aren’t quirky desires like wanting to dye your hair blue. they’re gross, weird, gorey, and uncomfortable. ocd doesn’t motivate you to clean, it makes you feel uncomfortable and dirty. i’m sick of people on tiktok taking something like adhd or ocd and making it some quirky little thing that is just so fun.

1989,"I’ve been thinking about this a lot in light of people diagnosing themselves with ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID based on TikTok content. As someone with what a psychiatrist called “the most clear cut case of ADHD I’ve ever seen”, it annoys me to see all these cute videos about quirky traits being attributed to ADHD. People without ADHD see these and think “I do this so maybe I have it!” and they completely gloss over the debilitating nature of living with ADHD.

I’m glad OCD hasn’t gotten the same cutesy spin as other mental illnesses, but it got me wondering why that is. And I think it’s because, with the ego-dystonic and logic-defying nature of this  illness, there’s really nothing relatable about it if you don’t have it. While some traits of ADHD, ASD, BPD, and DID can be relatable to a broader audience, nothing about being worried you’re a pedophile, or being terrified you’ll cheat on your partner when you have no intention to, or having intrusive thoughts about harming others is something people can relate to if they don’t experience it. Nor would they want to. 

It can feel really lonely at times because very few people understand, but it also means there aren’t a wave of self-diagnosed-from-TikTok folks clogging up access to services, so I see it as a good thing.

1990,"I have been dealing with OCD since I was 7/8 years old. I had never gotten help while living with my parents, and now as an adult I sought help on my own.

I have been on medication for depression/anxiety for over a year now, and last month I changed psychiatrists and the new one ordered my medication dosage to be increased. So last week I saw her again and she prescribed me Ritalin, which I started taking on Tuesday.

I stepped ""wrong"" into the crosswalk and I FELT NO ANXIETY OR FRUSTRATION.

I was shocked for a moment and I started stepping on everything I could. All the lines in the floor, cracks in the concrete, shadows and imaginary lines. I felt like a kid and almost cried.
