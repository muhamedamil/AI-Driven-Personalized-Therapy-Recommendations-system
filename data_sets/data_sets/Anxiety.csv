"I wanted to share my experience and possibly get some advice. Ever since I was little, I remeber having spells of intense fear and panic for no reason that would last for days at a time. I would get this feeling in the pit of my stomach and then my body would get hot and I would know that I was going through it again. Fast foward to my late teen years, I got put on Sertraline, which seemed to help a lot with the racing thoughts and overall feeling of panic and dread. Occasionally I would still get this feeling, but it would go away within a couple hours or maybe a day at most. After about 5 years on Sertraline (getting it from the same pharmacy) my family changed our prescriptions to come from an online pharmacy. Now, I’m not sure if this is why I’m spiraling and having these intense feelings of fear and distress, but I think the addatives in the pill may be different and that is why I’m going thought this right now. I’ll be at work, with heart palpitations, a tight chest and shoulders, sweating, and an intense feeling of fear and depression for no reason. It’s like my body is in a constant state of fight or flight and I can’t seem to escape it. 

I guess my point of this post is to ask if anyone else can relate to these random feelings of fear and eeriness. Sertraline really seemed to help me this last few years, so I’m hoping switching back to my original pharmacist will help elevate this distress. I’m trying so hard to stay strong, but this is hell. I am home in my bed, but for some reason I’m scared and afraid.. doesn’t help I live in the middle of the woods lmao. 

For those who experience these intense feelings, are there any medications that have reduced your panic and anxiety? Are benzos something to look into? I read that the long-lasting benzos such as clonazepam and Valium may be a good fit for GAD. Might be good to mention I also definitely have OCD… though never officially diagnosed. I fear my OCD leads to GAD and therefore leads to DPDR. Good lord I wish I had a different brain! 🧠 Thanks for reading.",Anxiety
"TW: mention of self harm. 

i’ve been having a rough 3 weeks with my anxiety. for some background, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at a young age. when i was in high school i was prescribed lexapro by a doctor who worked in the adolescent medicine department of the children’s hospital near me (on the hospital website it stated that she specializes in anxiety disorders and more). i was on lexapro for 3 years. those 3 years had to have been the darkest and hardest years of my life. i felt like a total zombie, struggled heavy with depression, terrible mood swings, my insomnia was at its worst, and i even developed suicidal thoughts which led me to hurt myself. throughout the time i was seeing this doctor, i would literally tell her the honest truth about what i was dealing with & she never took me off of the medication & just kept prescribing higher dosages. when i graduated high school and moved to college, i decided to stop taking the lexapro cold turkey & man when i tell yall i had never felt that amazing in my entire life. since then i would have my moments. i’d deal with my occasional panic attacks, when triggered, but it wasn’t until last fall (september 2023) where i started to have random anxiety attacks. it wasn’t severe, at first it was rough and i decided to go home for a few weeks but then i felt better and moved on. now fast forward to now. early december of this past year, i started to feel HEAVY feelings of anxiety, so heavy they felt as horrible as they did when i was first diagnosed (back then my anxiety was extremely severe). i ignored the feelings, but it wasn’t until 3 weeks ago on sunday january 12th where i just exploded. since then ive been having random anxiety attacks throughout the day, im not eating, and im not sleeping at night bc ill be up having anxiety attacks or my mind just won’t let me sleep. it’s been so bad that i haven’t been able to go to work. i moved back home this past school year so my mom has been helping me through this and we found me a new psychiatrist. i had my appointment today and she brought up the option of taking medication to try and help me. she mentioned how Sertraline is her favorite medication to prescribe her patients bc for the most part all of her patients have reacted very well & said it was a game changer. she also mentioned how she didn’t agree with how my last doctor approached my situation with the lexapro (which made me feel like maybe i could trust her), but after that experience i am extremely terrified to even try medication again….i did some research and even searched up videos on tiktok bc i rather hear about peoples experiences since i think that means more than research. so if anyone has been diagnosed with GAD and takes Sertraline (without any other medications), pls let me know what your experience has been like!! i really want to get better, im starting therapy next week first & i’ll go from there.

"Mine is not thinking too much of xyz which are bothering me. I learned it after years of exhausting overthinking coupled with suffocating anxiety.

Also when in immigration I had to make living for myself because I was alone in the country, I was doing things which were difficult for me both socially and psychologically. 

One example- I had one housemate at one point and she never was seen outside her room as there was a toilet and shower in it. Her boyfriend told me that she has social anxiety and she is gutted when she has to come out.
And I thought to myself wow that’s where I should be at but instead of it I am a delivery person with lots of socialising. Because I don’t have a boyfriend paying for my room, food etc.. Then I was recreation assistant and again with large people flow. I hated my days on the job but I was still doing it because I needed money.

Another example- oh how I hated school- I was too sensitive and even getting headaches from the noise levels during breaks. But homeschooling wasn’t and option, I haven’t thought about such option until covid lockdowns.

One more example- I have suffocating sensation from my anxiety. But I applied for the job during Covid and I worked in a mask, which also made my glasses foggy. As much as it was bothering me I kept working there because that was the plan. I would stop in my ways and grab the bread shelves I was loading, people walking around me, and I was gasping for air trying to make an inhale, sometimes for the duration of couple of minutes, and no one cared. So didn’t I. But those were low-key panic attacks.

So it was horrible to live through such daunting conditions for me, I developed burnout and went into major depressive episode after few years like so, but now I know I am capable to adapt and live however will be required…


And when something is bothering me, I pretent to myself that I sort of don’t have this problem.
I treat my struggles as a game and brush them off. Not escaping though- I acknowledge that I have it and kind of playfully challenge myself, asking, so what? 

(Of course it isn’t foolproof and doesn’t work during full-on depressive episode).",Anxiety

"Long story short, 29 F, diagnosed with GAD and CPTSD in 2018. Currently no health insurance. I was prescribed Fluoxetine 20 mg BID and  Buspirone 5 mg AS NEEDED in 2023 by a Nurse Practitioner at a regular physical exam that I had mentioned my worsening anxiety and suicidal ideations.  I had previously been prescribed Fluoxetine 30 mg BID and Alprazolam 0.5 BID OR as needed, which worked for a while, was presribed by my last psychiatrist but had lost insurance coverage and could no longer see her. My question is, is Buspirone actually effective as needed? I've been overall good with my anxiety and stuff but EVERY time I get my period I have horrible anxiety and moods swings. I'm looking for something to take off the edge or give me something since I don't have health coverage currently. Everything I have found online says that it needs to build up in my system.

"So I only joined and started contributing to Reddit recently, if anyone looks up my profile, you can see I mostly posted in cUTI and anxiety topics. I have the worst health anxiety and GAD so I've obviously always been googling everything before Reddit as well. And while there are tons of useful tips and shared experiences I can find here, I also noticed that reading about other people's stories sometimes creates even worse scenarios in my head. If a comment is not reassuring, my anxiety spikes again. After all, we have no clue who's posting and saying what, all our experiences can be vastly different.
So I'm kind of thinking about deleting this app because I tend to check it out now every time my phone's in my hand, like when I mindlessly scroll social media (probably should delete those apps too). And I can genuinely feel that's not great for my mental health.
Anybody feels anything similar? What do you think?",Anxiety
"hi, i was diagnosed with GAD when i was 8 years old, im now 20 and currently feeling the same way i would feel when my anxiety was at it’s prime all because i’m seeing scary things on the news & social media. when i was first diagnosed my therapist would tell me parents to try to avoid me from watching the news and certain movies/tv shows of natural disasters or anything that can set me off, so this isn’t new, but i thought that i may have already moved passed that trigger. as i grew up, i learned to just not let outer events affect me and to just chill, but for the past few weeks it’s felt like i’m 8 years old again dealing with the scariest and worst feelings of anxiety. 

today it got pretty bad, for i had to leave my long distance boyfriend to come back home after visiting him for 2 weeks and all i could think about was the fear of it possibly being our last goodbye all bc lately my social media has been flooded with passings of loved ones, natural disasters, talk of war, etc. i stopped going to therapy in high school because i just never found the right therapist, and it’s just so expensive. i’m not on any medications anymore either, i was on lexapro for around 3 yrs & it turned me into a total depressed suicidal zombie. 

i guess im just looking for reassurance that this isn’t just something that happens to me and i guess tips on how to try to move past this? i’m a 20 yr old college student who’s also in a sorority studying marketing soooo deleting social media isn’t rlly an option. i’ve tried blocking countless news accounts on all of my socials, yet i keep finding these terrible things. it also doesn’t help that it’s most of these topics are normal conversation at the moment. :,) ",Anxiety

"Hi everyone, my name is Anna.

I am currently working with a team of scientists who have developed a new lithium salt — lithium ascorbate. Our research shows that it has the potential to become an alternative to currently used compounds, as it demonstrates significant effectiveness with lower toxicity.

Lithium is widely known as a first-choice treatment for mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. This has created an image of lithium as a ""last resort"" for severe cases.

However, lithium is an essential element for the normal functioning of all body systems and, most importantly, the brain. The human body requires 0.7 mg of lithium per day for proper functioning. Without it, the risk of various mental health conditions increases. 

The findings of our research have been published in an article in the journal *Molecules*. Below is a brief summary, and you can read the full text via this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2253).

What did we find out?

* Lithium ascorbate prevents the reabsorption of dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) by neurons, which helps increase their levels and prolong their action, resulting in a stable good mood;
* Lithium ascorbate increases cell survival under conditions of glutamate stress. It enhances the regenerative capacity and formation of new connections among neurons within the central nervous system; 
* Lithium ascorbate prevents glutamate stress, which leads to anxiety disorders;
* Lithium ascorbate is characterized by low acute and chronic toxicity; it is safe even when used in high doses.

According to the article, we can conclude that lithium ascorbate is a safer substance to support our mental health, with the same or even better effects than commonly used lithium carbonate.

If you're curious about how lithium ascorbate could revolutionize mental health support or have questions about its potential benefits, let's start a conversation! What are your thoughts on this next-gen lithium salt?

"Hello. I know what i want to do in life but still cant come out of intrusive thoughts(distraction). For example if i see some cringe content creator(such as one doing cheap pranks in public or doing dance in public) and he/she is getting views(fame) for that then i feel the thing they are doing dont require any hard work or struggle.

"Hi! Has anyone here had oral conscious sedation at the dentist for a root canal or possible extraction or both? I have had iv sedation before for 2 extractions 2 farthest back upper teeth.

"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing relatively well. I am the moderator here and I'd like to share a couple of the best solutions I have found to (potentially) overcoming the bulk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

My philosophy is that often a large chunk of the GAD is caused by limiting beliefs. Eliminating the limiting beliefs could potentially wipe out the entire disorder.

Here are the best (free) ways I know how to do this:

1. Faster EFT
2. Lefkoe Method

(There are other ways but you need to hire a practitioner for them. Actually, it's best you hire one for the methods above also, especially if you have big painful memories inside you that you just want to run away from. I am not trained in the above methods, I just believe in them and found them personally transformative. You can, of course, learn to do these yourself for free, read on if this resonates).

Faster EFT operates under the assumption that beliefs come from memories. If you dismantle your unwanted memories, your limiting beliefs vanish also. (Because they came from the memories). An example: someone unexpectedly beat you as a child (this happened to the founder of this method) you change the memory and no longer feel anxiety around people that remind you of that person. If you want to find out more about this method, Robert the founder has over 1000 videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SkillsToChange) showing how to do it, testimonials, troubleshooting tips etc.

The Lefkoe Method (TLM) is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety (for public speaking). It went down from 7/10 to 1.5/10 on average over a handful of sessions (if I recall correctly). TLM focuses on beliefs. Say you feel unworthy, then you may have a limiting belief of ""I'm unworthy"". You go through the one of the processes and realise you never saw evidence of that objectively because the world is 100% neutral at all times. The belief vanishes and you feel lighter immediately. If you want to find out more about this method, go to the r/TheLefkoeMethod sub, there is a pinned post where you can try it immediately. This one I found it quite hard to do, but well worth the time to get the hang of it.

Both of these methods are very powerful and you can do it for free! Profound results not unheard of, such as eliminating trauma from seeing someone killed to being unable to feel bad about it 10 minutes later. Check them out!",Anxiety

If i get to know that from which source he is getting mobiles for so cheap i can also earn money easily. Basically my mind believes in easy money game and then gets me into overthinking.

I trained and mentored so many new hires over the years that they asked me to, did every task I was asked, the job of 3 for a period of time, I left with close to a $3,000 check of unused vacation hours paid out, I’d make it a point to come into work and show that I wanted to be there whether I left early or came in late for appts. They knew I had anxiety and panic all of these years, why they chose to wanna demote me now even though my work was always done I have no idea, but I left on my own. It was a slap in the face to me and I was not going to be embarrassed. I had too much pride. Started a job as a high school receptionist shortly after had more panic attacks when the kids came back to school I couldn’t handle the busyness) idk what to do anymore.

When it all kicks in I wish I felt that normal all of the time. I can eat, drive, and go into a restaurant, not sure about a store. I’m at 60mg buspirone for a month and a half now. I’ve been on this med since 2019 and it helped tremendously up until this year. I was never at 60 back then. Just got to that November 10. He’s added Prozac 10mg. I’ve been nervous to start. Even more that the pharmacist when counseling on it said she loves it for weight control, and depression but made a scrunchy face and said it may not be good for a person with anxiety as it’s known to make a person more nervous. Great! Just venting guys. I know what I need to do. Quit hoping for a miracle that my buspirone increase will finally help like it had been. Quit hoping my Dr will slightly increase my Benzo. And just quit hoping for a miracle. And start an ssri for the first time. My sleep isn’t great, i stay hydrated, but I don’t eat well because anxiety tenses me up so much I feel like I can’t even swallow properly. Sometimes I’m starving sometimes I have no appetite. But this has been such a depressing year depressed because of the anxiety and panic. I don’t even know what triggered the anxiety and panic to come back in April the way it did. So harsh. This is how I felt in 2019 when it first hit me. Maybe work was my trigger. My nephew came to live with me, it had been always been a quiet house just me and my pops. His toddler visits on the weekend. He’s a lot to handle that munchkin. Maybe the no more quiet time I was used to? That was when I was working and weekends were my only me time. But I was focused on helping with the toddler. I noticed my anxiety didn’t happen until 6 years after my mom’s death in 2019 she passed in 2013 and now a year after my sister in laws death who passed in 2023. Maybe now since im the only girl left in my immediate family im expected to be the go to. Idk about other families but ive noticed the daughters or the sisters are the go tos. I’m sorry for the long post and thank you if you’ve read this far. It feels good to talk or type it out. I’ll hopefully see a therapist in January as well. ❤️",Anxiety
"I hate this time of year. Winter, the Holidays, New Years….all of it. I never understood why so many people love this time of year so much  when it does nothing but make me miserable due to my anxiety.

 On top of GAD, I also have other mental health issues, so that makes it all the more worse. These past few years have been fucking awful on me (2023-early 2024 were the worst years for my mental health.) , everything I feared would happen happened, and now I can’t help but worry that this year will be no different due to let downs. I’ve always feared the future, and the arrival of 2025 makes me uneasy, I hate how fast time goes by- I’d do anything to make it slow down for me.

I’ve told my therapist this, but she’s absolutely zero help. (She really never has been, I’m considering dropping her.) 

Is anyone else just…genuinely terrified for the future? Like, do you just kind of expect things to go wrong because that’s what you’re used too? This has been an issue my whole life and I’ve never felt comfortable discussing it with others because they never understand.",Anxiety
"Hello fellow GAD ""enjoyers""!

My anxiety has flared up in the recent weeks, and thus read a lot about the condition just to understand it better. That's when I came across a company called Mind Medicine who is developing an LSD-based drug to tackle GAD. They have successfully passed the FDA's Phase 2 trial. Phase 3 trial should have started by now.

Oddly/interestingly, no new drug for GAD has been developed in the last 20 years or so, though there are at least 20M adults living with GAD in the US only (as per MM's website). I also read it somewhere that anxiety has rapidly increased in the population in the last couple of decades, so maybe there is a connection: it is now even more profitable to come up with a new drug.

I'd also recommend Dr. Gabor Mate's book of The Myth of Normal. Mate is describing how off our modern society is vs what thousands of years of evolution is wired into our brains. A good example he gives is of a Venezuelan tribe, living in the rainforest: their newborns are constantly wrapped around their mother's, and they won't touch the ground for 2 years. Their mothers smell, touch of skin, heartbeat is constantly there - 24/7. Plus the whole tribe is also present, from young to old. No kindergarten at the age of 6-month, no mother going to their 9to5. I don't say we should go back to prehistoric conditions. All I'm saying is no surprise mental illnesses are on the rise when we are so far off what nature intended for us.

I'm currently switching from Vortioxetine (Trintellix/Brintellix) to Paroxetine (Paxil/Rexetin) as Vortioxetine is just a mood-enhancer, only slightly easing anxiety symptoms.

"Hi everyone, I'm 28 and have been dealing with persistent, severe anxiety symptoms since childhood. I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, near-fainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hyper-vigilance that make daily life a challenge.

I've tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didn’t help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. I’ve also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 24/7 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally.

I’ve spent years undergoing medical tests (MRIs, blood work, specialist visits) to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and I’m being referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

I’m looking into nardil as a next step and am curious if anyone here has had success with it for anxiety. Also open to any advice, insights, or experiences with treatment-resistant anxiety.",Anxiety

"I want to hear from people who have this diagnosis. What does it feel like to you. How did it start, and how long has it lasted. What does your day look like.. I’m scared

I’ll explain my situation if anyone wants to read. I had panic disorder when I was a teenager. Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But I’ve never had “normal” anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but I’m not capable of sitting in it. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever had. 

Nothing is giving me the anxiety. I just have anxiety for no reason and without a trigger. I try to distract it, but it always creeps back on me.",Anxiety

"Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent.

My current fixation is accidentally getting high, I used to be a stoner, I did acid once and shrooms twice and dabbled in pills, I never had a bad experience visually but the last time I smoked and did shrooms it triggered internee panic and then I was fine when I sobered up, I didn’t see anything scary but I just wasn’t ok.

I had to keep moving so I can discharge all that energy. It was terrible.

i asked him if i can do anything to support him in this difficult time but he doesnt want to talk about his inner world and is blocking and builds a wall. i just feel so disconnected to him and i dont know how to support him because he isnt communicating his needs. idk if he needs space or me just being there. idk whats going on in his mind and im just trying to understand his symptoms and the best ways to support him but i cant solve our relationship struggles on my own. i dont want to lose him and i love him so much.

However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. 

 I'm not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, I'm not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot.

I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past.

He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help?

She is really struggling with her anxiety, and her depression. She rarely gets out of bed during the week, leaves the house possible once a week. Nothing seems to bring her joy or happiness right now, and I have zero idea how I can help.

I really want to be there for her as much as possible, and I only want to help her, but I just have no idea at all how to do it. If I try to get her to talk about her feelings, or what she is feeling and thinking, she just tells me she is depressed and does not want to be awake. She is constantly anxious as well. Dealing with waves of anxiety throughout the day.

I love her so incredibly much, and I just feel completely helpless because I have not found any supportive tactic that has helped her at all whatsoever. So I am here, asking for ideas, thoughts, things that your significant others do to help you. I want to be as constructive and supporting as I possibly can. Any and all help would mean so much.",Anxiety
"background info: i'm a 17 year old female, been diagnosed with GAD and depression and have been taking 20mg of prozac since september.

so i guess this is kind of a question/experience. has anyone else experienced a strong urge to throw up while having anxiety/panic attacks? not in the ""i feel naseous, need to throw up"" way, but more bulimic tendencies like actually scheduling time to go to the restroom at school and making yourself throw up? 

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds. 

(i am not doing this anymore. mostly because my country is in lockdown and i'm at home with my entire family 24/7. our bathroom walls and foors are both made if milk glass and would make descreetly throwing up not very possible.) 

thankfully my anxiety levels have gone down and i'm not feeling that urge anymore, but i am concerned that it will come back if i'm in a stressful situation like that again. so i guess i'm just sharing this to ask if anyone else has had these feelings due to high anxiety. or if this could be a symptom not of my anxiety disorder, but potentially bulimia. 

any comments are welcome and appreciated :)",Anxiety
"hi everyone!! I hope you're all holding up & practicing self-care during these confusing and difficult times.

I just got diagnosed w GAD, although I've always suspected it but invalidated myself before. I was also prescribed Citalopram (Celexa) 10mg to start with, and I wanted to know if others had experiences with this medication or any anti-anxiety medication. I don't want to get my hopes up too high...I know it won't fix all my problems but I'm afraid I might be expecting too much in terms of relief. I don't even really know what I am expecting if i'm being honest, I guess I just want to know what to expect in case.  I keep imagining this scenario where my Co-workers/friends/family notice I've changed for the better /  enjoy my company more, but I don't know if that is realistic...so I'd rather have that dream shattered rn rather than later lol. I am not too worried about symptoms / side effects because I can always switch meds if that is the case, my psychiatrist is super sweet so I'm not intimidated to bring that up. 

Also if anyone wants to share some coping mechanisms / activities they do to help their anxiety that is more than welcome. Thank you all!!! <3",Anxiety

"Anyone else deal with this? I already follow the emetophobia page and it’s helpful. 

I’ve felt this for years now. I also have anxiety for other reasons, but this is awful at times. Anything that triggers the thought of throwing up - which can be a stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, or just hearing about someone who’s been sick - makes the anxiety worse. There are times when I’m perfectly OK and other times when the anxiety surrounding throwing up affects me for days or weeks until I can get my mind away from it. 

Today at work, I had a stomach ache, I kept focusing on the ache and it made it worse. My stomach felt like it was burning. My heart started racing and it made me feel like I could throw up. After a few mins, I got myself to calm down enough and the burning feeling in my stomach went away. 

It’s awful man.. anything that involves throw up or the feeling of it, I’m in straight panic mode. I can totally create the feeling in my head. One time I actually got sick in the middle of the night and to this day I think it was from making myself anxious about a feeling in my stomach...",Anxiety
"Some background: I'm diagnosed Bipolar (I'm on lithium), OCD, and GAD. My anxiety gets so bad some times that I'll be unable to function in a normal situation. (I once stood at the door of a party and stared at a wall for 10 minutes straight clutching a box. When I finally moved, I perched onto of a chair and curled up around my water bottle. Or I'll refuse to go into buildings my body deems unsafe.) 

Seeing as I live in the New York-  New Jersey area,  I should say life that last month has been atypical.  I'm temporarily displaced from my daily routine and I had to form a new schedule.  And I'm finding in this new, uncertain schedule, my anxiety is getting worse.  

My psychiatrist and I started an approach 2-ish years ago, to control the bipolar disorder.  And that has leveled off.  But now that we are here, in quarantine (shelter in place) I'm so anxious.  Does anyone have any tips on how to talk to my psychiatrist? I 'see"" her on Monday. I've started journaling when I have panic attacks and what triggered them and if it's related to an OCD episode or not.  But is there anything I should be including? I rarely talk fo her about anxiety, and if we do it's not really a problem.  I know reddit wont know what my psychiatrist will ask, but if you could help me prepare for the questions so I'll have appropriate answers, that would be awesome.

Interpersonal relationships (mainly I just entered a new relationship and I'm head over heels for him and I'm terrified I'm not enough. And my best friends leaving me because I'm ""crazy."" As I put it.)

I was prescribed 10mg of Prozac (i'm 4 days in now) and ever since my panic attack I've been having this really unsettling sensation in my head that often comes with dizziness. It's not pain but it feels like someone is applying pressure in my head and I can feel it around the centre of my face so behind my eyes, my cheekbones and both of my ears, and it usually only appears when i'm anxious and when i'm laying down to go to bed.

"Last year or so, I was referred to a psychiatrist (I think that’s the right word I’m sorry my medical lingo not great) to talk about my anxiety disorder.  My anxiety surges in amazing highs and lows, where one day I think I’m the best contender for Prime Minister, and the next I think I’ll be a crack head for the rest of my life. My therapist thinks my anxiety is chronic, and that I was probably born with it or developed it in early childhood. The psychiatrist said that while I definitely met the standards for having GAD, my level of day-to-day functioning does “not require intervention on our part.” Basically, he said I didn’t need any drugs, and that if I wanted to, I didn’t even have to keep seeing my therapist anymore. 
I don’t see my therapist anymore, and it’s been over a year since I’ve taken a psychiatric drug. My anxiety is still pretty much the same, and sometimes I really feel like I should be in therapy or medicated to help with it. But when I called back to my local mental health clinic, my anxieties described in the intake interview were “not serious enough to warrant our action.” 
Basically: does anyone else have any similar experience with this kind of thing? Honestly just hoping someone tells me I’m not crazy 😂",Anxiety
"Hi so im someone who has gone through a lot of anxiety and depression in my childhood... I don't know when it started just because for the longest time, I thought it was the norm. My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either.

"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing relatively well. I am the moderator here and I'd like to share a couple of the best solutions I have found to (potentially) overcoming the bulk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

My philosophy is that often a large chunk of the GAD is caused by limiting beliefs. Eliminating the limiting beliefs could potentially wipe out the entire disorder.

Here are the best (free) ways I know how to do this:

1. Faster EFT
2. Lefkoe Method

(There are other ways but you need to hire a practitioner for them. Actually, it's best you hire one for the methods above also, especially if you have big painful memories inside you that you just want to run away from. I am not trained in the above methods, I just believe in them and found them personally transformative. You can, of course, learn to do these yourself for free, read on if this resonates).

Faster EFT operates under the assumption that beliefs come from memories. If you dismantle your unwanted memories, your limiting beliefs vanish also. (Because they came from the memories). An example: someone unexpectedly beat you as a child (this happened to the founder of this method) you change the memory and no longer feel anxiety around people that remind you of that person. If you want to find out more about this method, Robert the founder has over 1000 videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SkillsToChange) showing how to do it, testimonials, troubleshooting tips etc.

The Lefkoe Method (TLM) is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety (for public speaking). It went down from 7/10 to 1.5/10 on average over a handful of sessions (if I recall correctly). TLM focuses on beliefs. Say you feel unworthy, then you may have a limiting belief of ""I'm unworthy"". You go through the one of the processes and realise you never saw evidence of that objectively because the world is 100% neutral at all times. The belief vanishes and you feel lighter immediately. If you want to find out more about this method, go to the r/TheLefkoeMethod sub, there is a pinned post where you can try it immediately. This one I found it quite hard to do, but well worth the time to get the hang of it.

Both of these methods are very powerful and you can do it for free! Profound results not unheard of, such as eliminating trauma from seeing someone killed to being unable to feel bad about it 10 minutes later. Check them out!",Anxiety
"I wanted to share my experience and possibly get some advice. Ever since I was little, I remeber having spells of intense fear and panic for no reason that would last for days at a time. I would get this feeling in the pit of my stomach and then my body would get hot and I would know that I was going through it again. Fast foward to my late teen years, I got put on Sertraline, which seemed to help a lot with the racing thoughts and overall feeling of panic and dread. Occasionally I would still get this feeling, but it would go away within a couple hours or maybe a day at most. After about 5 years on Sertraline (getting it from the same pharmacy) my family changed our prescriptions to come from an online pharmacy. Now, I’m not sure if this is why I’m spiraling and having these intense feelings of fear and distress, but I think the addatives in the pill may be different and that is why I’m going thought this right now. I’ll be at work, with heart palpitations, a tight chest and shoulders, sweating, and an intense feeling of fear and depression for no reason. It’s like my body is in a constant state of fight or flight and I can’t seem to escape it. 

I guess my point of this post is to ask if anyone else can relate to these random feelings of fear and eeriness. Sertraline really seemed to help me this last few years, so I’m hoping switching back to my original pharmacist will help elevate this distress. I’m trying so hard to stay strong, but this is hell. I am home in my bed, but for some reason I’m scared and afraid.. doesn’t help I live in the middle of the woods lmao. 

For those who experience these intense feelings, are there any medications that have reduced your panic and anxiety? Are benzos something to look into? I read that the long-lasting benzos such as clonazepam and Valium may be a good fit for GAD. Might be good to mention I also definitely have OCD… though never officially diagnosed. I fear my OCD leads to GAD and therefore leads to DPDR. Good lord I wish I had a different brain! 🧠 Thanks for reading.",Anxiety
"TW: mention of self harm. 

i’ve been having a rough 3 weeks with my anxiety. for some background, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at a young age. when i was in high school i was prescribed lexapro by a doctor who worked in the adolescent medicine department of the children’s hospital near me (on the hospital website it stated that she specializes in anxiety disorders and more). i was on lexapro for 3 years. those 3 years had to have been the darkest and hardest years of my life. i felt like a total zombie, struggled heavy with depression, terrible mood swings, my insomnia was at its worst, and i even developed suicidal thoughts which led me to hurt myself. throughout the time i was seeing this doctor, i would literally tell her the honest truth about what i was dealing with & she never took me off of the medication & just kept prescribing higher dosages. when i graduated high school and moved to college, i decided to stop taking the lexapro cold turkey & man when i tell yall i had never felt that amazing in my entire life. since then i would have my moments. i’d deal with my occasional panic attacks, when triggered, but it wasn’t until last fall (september 2023) where i started to have random anxiety attacks. it wasn’t severe, at first it was rough and i decided to go home for a few weeks but then i felt better and moved on. now fast forward to now. early december of this past year, i started to feel HEAVY feelings of anxiety, so heavy they felt as horrible as they did when i was first diagnosed (back then my anxiety was extremely severe). i ignored the feelings, but it wasn’t until 3 weeks ago on sunday january 12th where i just exploded. since then ive been having random anxiety attacks throughout the day, im not eating, and im not sleeping at night bc ill be up having anxiety attacks or my mind just won’t let me sleep. it’s been so bad that i haven’t been able to go to work. i moved back home this past school year so my mom has been helping me through this and we found me a new psychiatrist. i had my appointment today and she brought up the option of taking medication to try and help me. she mentioned how Sertraline is her favorite medication to prescribe her patients bc for the most part all of her patients have reacted very well & said it was a game changer. she also mentioned how she didn’t agree with how my last doctor approached my situation with the lexapro (which made me feel like maybe i could trust her), but after that experience i am extremely terrified to even try medication again….i did some research and even searched up videos on tiktok bc i rather hear about peoples experiences since i think that means more than research. so if anyone has been diagnosed with GAD and takes Sertraline (without any other medications), pls let me know what your experience has been like!! i really want to get better, im starting therapy next week first & i’ll go from there.

"Mine is not thinking too much of xyz which are bothering me. I learned it after years of exhausting overthinking coupled with suffocating anxiety.

Also when in immigration I had to make living for myself because I was alone in the country, I was doing things which were difficult for me both socially and psychologically. 

One example- I had one housemate at one point and she never was seen outside her room as there was a toilet and shower in it. Her boyfriend told me that she has social anxiety and she is gutted when she has to come out.
And I thought to myself wow that’s where I should be at but instead of it I am a delivery person with lots of socialising. Because I don’t have a boyfriend paying for my room, food etc.. Then I was recreation assistant and again with large people flow. I hated my days on the job but I was still doing it because I needed money.

Another example- oh how I hated school- I was too sensitive and even getting headaches from the noise levels during breaks. But homeschooling wasn’t and option, I haven’t thought about such option until covid lockdowns.

One more example- I have suffocating sensation from my anxiety. But I applied for the job during Covid and I worked in a mask, which also made my glasses foggy. As much as it was bothering me I kept working there because that was the plan. I would stop in my ways and grab the bread shelves I was loading, people walking around me, and I was gasping for air trying to make an inhale, sometimes for the duration of couple of minutes, and no one cared. So didn’t I. But those were low-key panic attacks.

So it was horrible to live through such daunting conditions for me, I developed burnout and went into major depressive episode after few years like so, but now I know I am capable to adapt and live however will be required…


And when something is bothering me, I pretent to myself that I sort of don’t have this problem.
I treat my struggles as a game and brush them off. Not escaping though- I acknowledge that I have it and kind of playfully challenge myself, asking, so what?

"hi, i was diagnosed with GAD when i was 8 years old, im now 20 and currently feeling the same way i would feel when my anxiety was at it’s prime all because i’m seeing scary things on the news & social media. when i was first diagnosed my therapist would tell me parents to try to avoid me from watching the news and certain movies/tv shows of natural disasters or anything that can set me off, so this isn’t new, but i thought that i may have already moved passed that trigger. as i grew up, i learned to just not let outer events affect me and to just chill, but for the past few weeks it’s felt like i’m 8 years old again dealing with the scariest and worst feelings of anxiety. 

today it got pretty bad, for i had to leave my long distance boyfriend to come back home after visiting him for 2 weeks and all i could think about was the fear of it possibly being our last goodbye all bc lately my social media has been flooded with passings of loved ones, natural disasters, talk of war, etc. i stopped going to therapy in high school because i just never found the right therapist, and it’s just so expensive. i’m not on any medications anymore either, i was on lexapro for around 3 yrs & it turned me into a total depressed suicidal zombie.

"Hi everyone, my name is Anna.

I am currently working with a team of scientists who have developed a new lithium salt — lithium ascorbate. Our research shows that it has the potential to become an alternative to currently used compounds, as it demonstrates significant effectiveness with lower toxicity.

Lithium is widely known as a first-choice treatment for mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. This has created an image of lithium as a ""last resort"" for severe cases.

However, lithium is an essential element for the normal functioning of all body systems and, most importantly, the brain. The human body requires 0.7 mg of lithium per day for proper functioning. Without it, the risk of various mental health conditions increases. 

The findings of our research have been published in an article in the journal *Molecules*. Below is a brief summary, and you can read the full text via this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2253).

What did we find out?

* Lithium ascorbate prevents the reabsorption of dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) by neurons, which helps increase their levels and prolong their action, resulting in a stable good mood;
* Lithium ascorbate increases cell survival under conditions of glutamate stress. It enhances the regenerative capacity and formation of new connections among neurons within the central nervous system; 
* Lithium ascorbate prevents glutamate stress, which leads to anxiety disorders;
* Lithium ascorbate is characterized by low acute and chronic toxicity; it is safe even when used in high doses.

According to the article, we can conclude that lithium ascorbate is a safer substance to support our mental health, with the same or even better effects than commonly used lithium carbonate.

If you're curious about how lithium ascorbate could revolutionize mental health support or have questions about its potential benefits, let's start a conversation! What are your thoughts on this next-gen lithium salt?

"I still don’t have my GAD and panic under control. I’ve been afraid to really venture out. Even though I’m trying to leave the house more often.

I feel this at home off and on but have panic attacks at stores, etc. About a week ago. I had a great day and came and went to Walmart without a panic attack. My point is I haven’t worked since August because of this anxiety and panic. I lost my full time 14 year job due to the supervisors wanting to demote me because of my anxiety. I left out of too much pride, and then I got a high school receptionist job a month later and had a panic attack when the student came back to school.

Just different dept and office. I used to be a court clerk for district court for 14 yrs but this job would be a secretary job for the local county road and bridge commissioner. And it’d be walking distance from me. I really want to apply but I’m so afraid. I NEED a full time job again. I’m afraid the symptoms of anxiety and panic will cause me to need to run to the bathroom or run out side and keep me from my job. I won’t have anywhere to “hide” anymore.

"Even if you make deep breaths. When you wake up, always. 

You’re on automatic. 

You cannot really be present. You feel you cannot see, literally see clearly. 

There’s also sometimes clear anxiety, some rumination, sometimes horrible. But this other aspect doesn’t ever change. Never. 

As if you could be on the other side of the world, and you really don’t mind because you can’t clearly notice things. Can’t Be really conscious. 

Be there. Feel, really feel. Enjoy. Have notion of time, space, the world, your family, the people. Know what you’re doing, look back and remember your childhood — any of these. As if you could die tomorrow and it would be the same. Also little reaction to pain. You can probably resist a lot of physical pain—because it feels as if you’re not there.

"Hello everyone. It is like i know what i want to do in life but my mind gets distracted in other directions therefore i have to give reasons to myself to not believe in distractions. If i cant think of reasons to eliminate distraction it will constantly be in my head. Just cant clear my mind, really confused, fighting my own thoughts. For instance i know i want to go for mba and prepare for cat but a thought of govt exams comes in my mind. Here i l know that at last i only want to prepare for cat but my mind gets tricked in thoughts of govt job like you’ll have good work life balance, you can earn under the table money. In contrast you,ll not be able to enjoy these things in corporate. But for sure in back of mind i know that these are just unusual thoughts and i’ll not go for govt jobs but unless i give myself solid reasons to eliminate the thought of govt jobs i cant move ahead. First i have to clear my mind from it. In total distractions come and i cant get them off unless i give myself solid reasons. Is it with anyone else.

"I've been living with anxiety since I remember. Officially I am diagnosed with GAD.  
I'm just after an ugly break-up. It's been only 3 months, and I decided to end the relationship but I'm now missing her - since I feel shit mentally, and now I'm also showing signs of depression (I would just be in bed all day), so I'm more missing the stability.

But it is for the better: she suffered a lot in her childhood with her parents divorcing at the age of 3. Kicked out of home at 18. Worked all kinds of jobs, but managed to obtain a college degree in finance. Kudos to her, I'm coming from an ivory tower, would not have been able to do what she had done.

She deserves to have a normal life, a partner who she can rely on, have children together, create a family. That's my silver lining.

I feel anxious everywhere I am, with everybody I'm with, from my family to friends to even my girlfriend. I always feel like I'm going to get a panic attack because my head tells me I need to 'run' from the situation. 

This incredible stupid anxious feeling is sucking the life out of me. I'm so damn frustrated with my self-sabotaging and not being able to have a single good day anymore. I fucking hate this and what I'm doing to myself. Why can't I just be happy and deal with stress like a normal person.

"I think i am suffering from mental illness. I think i am in a delusion. I know I am delusional. I think logically about delusions and come to fact that they are false. But deep down I still feel they are true I still believe them. I think about a particular career option and think it is easy and it is a trick or it has loopholes. So i can easily earn money from it. There is no need to struggle, hustle. People are earning from loopholes. But deep down i know i cant do this. This is not right. I am preparing for cat but due to overthinking i cant atudy. For example if i see a person doing cringe shit and getting views  from it i beleive this is the easy way to earn money. Recently i saw a mobile shop owner selling demo pieces and i got trapped in overthinking that it is some trick how he is selling mobile for such low prices. If i get to know that from which source he is getting mobiles for so cheap i can also earn money easily. Basically my mind believes in easy money game and then gets me into overthinking. I know my maths is good. If i see a teacher earning very much from coaching i also believe that i also should start a coaching and i can easy money and i should leave my preparation for mba. If i someone doing pranks or doing cringe things like dancing in public comes to my feed i believe that no talent is required for it and they are getting views so easily. So why should i study and afterwards go to job instead i should just make pranks in public which i know i cant. This is just not right. I have consulted a psychatrist but no improvement from medications. Doctor told me its ocd and gad. I think i cant explain to the doctor correctly. If this is happening to someone else please comment and dm me. If anyone knows what kind of disorder it is please tell. I cant study from last 2 years as my mind is trapped in this only. I know I want to prepare for my MBA. If i see a video of chess I get trapped in overthinking.

"Just venting Loooong post: Managed to lately get In my car more and try to leave my house. I drive more in my little hometown now. But I’ll walk into a small dollar store (won’t try Walmart yet) and I stay towards the front of the store for a few minutes and then run back out because I can’t breathe. My anxiety is 90 percent physical. Even when I’m at home it’s Lots of gasping for air, feeling like I can’t breathe deep, skipped heart beats, lump in throat feeling that’s just pure anxiety but makes you want to puke out that lump in throat feeling. Or cry it out but then I can’t breathe again. Feeling trapped in my car. I know for the most part I’m healthy as far as I know. Slight vitamin d deficiency, abnormal high iron in the 300s, thyroid is always normal. Thank god. I try to think of other things that could cause these symptoms to check in the new year when I finally have medical insurance. (Lost my job, well left my 14 year court clerk job back in June after the new supervisors wanted to demote me from my high rank I took so long and worked so hard to get to because I wasn’t “dependable” anymore without saying but because of my anxiety and panic attacks, they didn’t like that I had to run outside because I would hyperventilate a lot, but I still came into work every day and did my job. This is after she told me to go outside if I needed to 🤦🏻‍♀️ so she took it back. So much worse was going on in that office but they wanted to make an example out of me. The way I was treated because I’m too quiet to stick up for myself. I can not even begin to tell you all I did for that office, not to toot my own horn but I was a damn hard worker who genuinely cared about my job, my accuracy, I was so proud of my job. I trained and mentored so many new hires over the years that they asked me to, did every task I was asked, the job of 3 for a period of time, I left with close to a $3,000 check of unused vacation hours paid out, I’d make it a point to come into work and show that I wanted to be there whether I left early or came in late for appts. They knew I had anxiety and panic all of these years, why they chose to wanna demote me now even though my work was always done I have no idea, but I left on my own. It was a slap in the face to me and I was not going to be embarrassed. I had too much pride. Started a job as a high school receptionist shortly after had more panic attacks when the kids came back to school I couldn’t handle the busyness) idk what to do anymore. I don’t work yet because I get physically sick form just going to the store and driving. If I’m medicated and take my xan* I do ok. But I can’t pop one every time I want to try to leave the house. I’d love to do that but my dr already said he won’t prescribe long term. He won’t even up my dose a little more than 0.25 twice a day. Instead He gave me klon 0.50 to try. But I haven’t yet. I feel since he’ll eventually get me off of them there’s no point in seeing if it’ll help. A few days ago, I took my 10mg propranolol, 4mg zofran, and 0.50 xan along with my daily med of busprione just to make it through my mammogram appt that was 25 mins away. When it all kicks in I wish I felt that normal all of the time. I can eat, drive, and go into a restaurant, not sure about a store. I’m at 60mg buspirone for a month and a half now. I’ve been on this med since 2019 and it helped tremendously up until this year. I was never at 60 back then. Just got to that November 10. He’s added Prozac 10mg. I’ve been nervous to start. Even more that the pharmacist when counseling on it said she loves it for weight control, and depression but made a scrunchy face and said it may not be good for a person with anxiety as it’s known to make a person more nervous. Great! Just venting guys. I know what I need to do. Quit hoping for a miracle that my buspirone increase will finally help like it had been. Quit hoping my Dr will slightly increase my Benzo. And just quit hoping for a miracle. And start an ssri for the first time. My sleep isn’t great, i stay hydrated, but I don’t eat well because anxiety tenses me up so much I feel like I can’t even swallow properly. Sometimes I’m starving sometimes I have no appetite. But this has been such a depressing year depressed because of the anxiety and panic. I don’t even know what triggered the anxiety and panic to come back in April the way it did. So harsh. This is how I felt in 2019 when it first hit me. Maybe work was my trigger. My nephew came to live with me, it had been always been a quiet house just me and my pops. His toddler visits on the weekend. He’s a lot to handle that munchkin. Maybe the no more quiet time I was used to? That was when I was working and weekends were my only me time. But I was focused on helping with the toddler. I noticed my anxiety didn’t happen until 6 years after my mom’s death in 2019 she passed in 2013 and now a year after my sister in laws death who passed in 2023. Maybe now since im the only girl left in my immediate family im expected to be the go to. Idk about other families but ive noticed the daughters or the sisters are the go tos.

"I hate this time of year. Winter, the Holidays, New Years….all of it. I never understood why so many people love this time of year so much  when it does nothing but make me miserable due to my anxiety.

 On top of GAD, I also have other mental health issues, so that makes it all the more worse. These past few years have been fucking awful on me (2023-early 2024 were the worst years for my mental health.) , everything I feared would happen happened, and now I can’t help but worry that this year will be no different due to let downs. I’ve always feared the future, and the arrival of 2025 makes me uneasy, I hate how fast time goes by- I’d do anything to make it slow down for me.

I’ve told my therapist this, but she’s absolutely zero help. (She really never has been, I’m considering dropping her.)

"Hello fellow GAD ""enjoyers""!

My anxiety has flared up in the recent weeks, and thus read a lot about the condition just to understand it better. That's when I came across a company called Mind Medicine who is developing an LSD-based drug to tackle GAD. They have successfully passed the FDA's Phase 2 trial. Phase 3 trial should have started by now.

Oddly/interestingly, no new drug for GAD has been developed in the last 20 years or so, though there are at least 20M adults living with GAD in the US only (as per MM's website). I also read it somewhere that anxiety has rapidly increased in the population in the last couple of decades, so maybe there is a connection: it is now even more profitable to come up with a new drug.

I'd also recommend Dr. Gabor Mate's book of The Myth of Normal. Mate is describing how off our modern society is vs what thousands of years of evolution is wired into our brains. A good example he gives is of a Venezuelan tribe, living in the rainforest: their newborns are constantly wrapped around their mother's, and they won't touch the ground for 2 years. Their mothers smell, touch of skin, heartbeat is constantly there - 24/7. Plus the whole tribe is also present, from young to old. No kindergarten at the age of 6-month, no mother going to their 9to5. I don't say we should go back to prehistoric conditions. All I'm saying is no surprise mental illnesses are on the rise when we are so far off what nature intended for us.

I'm currently switching from Vortioxetine (Trintellix/Brintellix) to Paroxetine (Paxil/Rexetin) as Vortioxetine is just a mood-enhancer, only slightly easing anxiety symptoms.

"Hi everyone, I'm 28 and have been dealing with persistent, severe anxiety symptoms since childhood. I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, near-fainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hyper-vigilance that make daily life a challenge.

I've tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didn’t help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. I’ve also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 24/7 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally.

I’ve spent years undergoing medical tests (MRIs, blood work, specialist visits) to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and I’m being referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

"I want to hear from people who have this diagnosis. What does it feel like to you. How did it start, and how long has it lasted. What does your day look like.. I’m scared

I’ll explain my situation if anyone wants to read. I had panic disorder when I was a teenager. Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But I’ve never had “normal” anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but I’m not capable of sitting in it. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever had.

"Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent.

"Happened to me(27M, diagnosed with GAD) in April after I met this girl. Instant connection and instant chemistry. Pretty soon after I realised I had fallen in love... I've had crushes before... This was different. I could tell I had fallen in love and it was horrible. I did have waves of euphoria but they were followed by huge amounts of anxiety. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I had to keep moving so I can discharge all that energy. It was terrible. 

Finally when I couldn't take it anymore and I asked the girl on a date. To which she responded that she's engaged and that she's a lesbian.

I should have felt heartbroken, but I felt relieved. Like the nightmare was over and I could breathe again. I had closure.

I don't know if I want to experience that again because of the euphoria or I should avoid it like the plague because of the anxiety.

"im in a 2yrs relationship with my bf who has a GAD diagnosis. i love him with all my heart and try to support him the best i can. 
i am diagnosed with adhd. lately, we have been struggling a lot due to my emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. anytime i try to communicate, eg.  apologize, clear things up, try to get his pov etc he starts to build up a wall and doesnt want to talk about it. 
he said he has a tough time with anxiety and he doesnt have the capacity for our relationship struggles and that im triggering his derealisation with my behavior (my emotions and me trying to communicate). i dont want to make things worse for him and i understand that im not the easiest partner to put up with. i just dont know how to communicate, because if i ask him what possibly could make him feel better he says that he cant talk about it rn.

i asked him if i can do anything to support him in this difficult time but he doesnt want to talk about his inner world and is blocking and builds a wall. i just feel so disconnected to him and i dont know how to support him because he isnt communicating his needs. idk if he needs space or me just being there. idk whats going on in his mind and im just trying to understand his symptoms and the best ways to support him but i cant solve our relationship struggles on my own. i dont want to lose him and i love him so much.
he always talked to me about his feelings and this is the first time where he is not able to communicate so im very confused

"My girlfriend has had GAD for about 5-6 years. I have known her and been dating her for almost 1. I have a severe mental disorder myself, so I'm not dumb to treatment options and I'm very aware of what is HER vs what is her disorder. However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. 

 I'm not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, I'm not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot. 

In short, I'm here asking others with the disorder, who deal with similar frustrations to let me know what has worked for you. I'm looking for tips, tricks, exercises be it breathing meditation cathartic activities... anything really. She wants to break this cycle and I'm all for helping her on the journey.

Is it possible these breathing problems are 100% anxiety and the fact that I now have an inhaler at the ready has lowered my anxiety concerning breathing issues without me having to actually use it??

I’ve been having nonstop anxiety attacks for 3 months and have suffered from an array of physical symptoms that have never left. I’m now on one month of 20mg prozac and take xanax as needed, and have moved in with my family, which being separated from them in another country made the situation worse. I feel like now i’m in a much more stable position but I still feel like absolute shit. I get daily headaches in the back of my head and temples, my vision hurts and I can’t focus it properly, and my limbs feel extremely weak. Throughout this whole thing I also developed horrible health anxiety and i’m constantly thinking I have a serio disease such as a brain tumor or MS, or even about to have a stroke. I wanted to know if any of you have recovered from extended periods of anxiety and how long was this process, I just want to feel like myself again, everything seems so hard to do.

"I just don’t understand where I’m at. I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help?

"I truly hope this post is okay, I'm really needing some help and guidance. I'm currently in a long term relationship with my significant other (32, F) who is diagnosed with generalized anxiety, and depression. I knew about it all before I got into a relationship with her, so there was no surprises or anything. She was very honest with me about what she deals with ahead of time. 

We have been together for a very long time, and I fear she is at her worst point with all of it in her life currently.

She is really struggling with her anxiety, and her depression. She rarely gets out of bed during the week, leaves the house possible once a week. Nothing seems to bring her joy or happiness right now, and I have zero idea how I can help.

I really want to be there for her as much as possible, and I only want to help her, but I just have no idea at all how to do it. If I try to get her to talk about her feelings, or what she is feeling and thinking, she just tells me she is depressed and does not want to be awake. She is constantly anxious as well. Dealing with waves of anxiety throughout the day.

I love her so incredibly much, and I just feel completely helpless because I have not found any supportive tactic that has helped her at all whatsoever.

"background info: i'm a 17 year old female, been diagnosed with GAD and depression and have been taking 20mg of prozac since september.

so i guess this is kind of a question/experience. has anyone else experienced a strong urge to throw up while having anxiety/panic attacks? not in the ""i feel naseous, need to throw up"" way, but more bulimic tendencies like actually scheduling time to go to the restroom at school and making yourself throw up? 

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds. 

(i am not doing this anymore. mostly because my country is in lockdown and i'm at home with my entire family 24/7. our bathroom walls and foors are both made if milk glass and would make descreetly throwing up not very possible.) 

thankfully my anxiety levels have gone down and i'm not feeling that urge anymore, but i am concerned that it will come back if i'm in a stressful situation like that again. so i guess i'm just sharing this to ask if anyone else has had these feelings due to high anxiety. or if this could be a symptom not of my anxiety disorder, but potentially bulimia.

I’ve felt this for years now. I also have anxiety for other reasons, but this is awful at times. Anything that triggers the thought of throwing up - which can be a stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, or just hearing about someone who’s been sick - makes the anxiety worse. There are times when I’m perfectly OK and other times when the anxiety surrounding throwing up affects me for days or weeks until I can get my mind away from it. 

Today at work, I had a stomach ache, I kept focusing on the ache and it made it worse. My stomach felt like it was burning. My heart started racing and it made me feel like I could throw up. After a few mins, I got myself to calm down enough and the burning feeling in my stomach went away. 

It’s awful man.. anything that involves throw up or the feeling of it, I’m in straight panic mode. I can totally create the feeling in my head. One time I actually got sick in the middle of the night and to this day I think it was from making myself anxious about a feeling in my stomach...",Anxiety

My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts...

I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

"Hello fellow GAD ""enjoyers""!

My anxiety has flared up in the recent weeks, and thus read a lot about the condition just to understand it better. That's when I came across a company called Mind Medicine who is developing an LSD-based drug to tackle GAD. They have successfully passed the FDA's Phase 2 trial. Phase 3 trial should have started by now.

Oddly/interestingly, no new drug for GAD has been developed in the last 20 years or so, though there are at least 20M adults living with GAD in the US only (as per MM's website). I also read it somewhere that anxiety has rapidly increased in the population in the last couple of decades, so maybe there is a connection: it is now even more profitable to come up with a new drug.

I'd also recommend Dr. Gabor Mate's book of The Myth of Normal. Mate is describing how off our modern society is vs what thousands of years of evolution is wired into our brains. A good example he gives is of a Venezuelan tribe, living in the rainforest: their newborns are constantly wrapped around their mother's, and they won't touch the ground for 2 years. Their mothers smell, touch of skin, heartbeat is constantly there - 24/7. Plus the whole tribe is also present, from young to old. No kindergarten at the age of 6-month, no mother going to their 9to5. I don't say we should go back to prehistoric conditions. All I'm saying is no surprise mental illnesses are on the rise when we are so far off what nature intended for us.

I'm currently switching from Vortioxetine (Trintellix/Brintellix) to Paroxetine (Paxil/Rexetin) as Vortioxetine is just a mood-enhancer, only slightly easing anxiety symptoms.

"I’ve had anxiety for years. It’s become worse the last couple years, especially being a mom and such. In addition to anxiety, I have health anxiety, emetophobia, and depression. 

Lately, I’ve found myself feeling nauseous in waves; it comes and goes. My stomach doesn’t hurt but there’s a tightness that wraps around my mid section and then there’s nausea. I find if I have enough distractions or if I’m focused on something, I don’t feel the nausea as much. 

Anyone get this?",Anxiety

"My girlfriend has had GAD for about 5-6 years. I have known her and been dating her for almost 1. I have a severe mental disorder myself, so I'm not dumb to treatment options and I'm very aware of what is HER vs what is her disorder. However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. 

 I'm not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, I'm not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot. 

In short, I'm here asking others with the disorder, who deal with similar frustrations to let me know what has worked for you. I'm looking for tips, tricks, exercises be it breathing meditation cathartic activities... anything really. She wants to break this cycle and I'm all for helping her on the journey. Thanks for reading -Shewolf",Anxiety
My gf I swear is addicted to assuming 🙃. We go to protest which make me nervous so to keep me calm I say things that are familiar or talk about things that are simple and calming to keep me grounded and so I don’t feel like a balloon floating by everyone else. But instead of asking me why I do that she goes “you don’t seem like you want to be there like your head isn’t in the right spot. Would you even go if I wasn’t around? Would you go out of your way?” YES I WOULD IF YOU HAD BOTHERED TO ASK INSTEAD OF COMING AT ME LIKE IF YOU KNOW ME BETTER THEN I KNOW ME AND WHAT I GO THROUGH. As you can tell I absolutely HATE it when people assume but HATE it more when people got attitude behind it. Am I overreacting?,Anxiety

"Hi! Does anyone else’s GAD go from rumination to paranoia on really bad days? I’ve been diagnosed with GAD for almost a decade so most of the times I know how to cope and rationalize myself but these past few days its been BAD!!! Every single little thing that usually upsets me a bit suddenly makes me paranoid and I am litteraly living in my head thinking that every friend and coworker doesnt like me!

"I probably have GAD but haven't been officially diagnosed. I recently have been having bouts of being short of breath and the frequency increased to the point that I called my doctor and they've prescribed an asthma inhaler. I went and got the inhaler, and all of the sudden, for the first night in a long time, I'm not have the breathing trouble. But I haven't used the inhaler yet!

Is it possible these breathing problems are 100% anxiety and the fact that I now have an inhaler at the ready has lowered my anxiety concerning breathing issues without me having to actually use it??

Obviously, it's only one night, we'll see what happens in the future, but the power of anxiety is crazy if that's what's going on. Anyone have similar experiences?",Anxiety
"I'm in therapy for my GAD but I still feel so damn broken. 

I feel anxious everywhere I am, with everybody I'm with, from my family to friends to even my girlfriend. I always feel like I'm going to get a panic attack because my head tells me I need to 'run' from the situation. 

This incredible stupid anxious feeling is sucking the life out of me. I'm so damn frustrated with my self-sabotaging and not being able to have a single good day anymore. I fucking hate this and what I'm doing to myself. Why can't I just be happy and deal with stress like a normal person.

"Anyone else deal with this? I already follow the emetophobia page and it’s helpful. 

I’ve felt this for years now. I also have anxiety for other reasons, but this is awful at times. Anything that triggers the thought of throwing up - which can be a stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, or just hearing about someone who’s been sick - makes the anxiety worse. There are times when I’m perfectly OK and other times when the anxiety surrounding throwing up affects me for days or weeks until I can get my mind away from it. 

Today at work, I had a stomach ache, I kept focusing on the ache and it made it worse. My stomach felt like it was burning. My heart started racing and it made me feel like I could throw up. After a few mins, I got myself to calm down enough and the burning feeling in my stomach went away. 

It’s awful man.. anything that involves throw up or the feeling of it, I’m in straight panic mode. I can totally create the feeling in my head. One time I actually got sick in the middle of the night and to this day I think it was from making myself anxious about a feeling in my stomach...",Anxiety

"I hate this time of year. Winter, the Holidays, New Years….all of it. I never understood why so many people love this time of year so much  when it does nothing but make me miserable due to my anxiety.

 On top of GAD, I also have other mental health issues, so that makes it all the more worse. These past few years have been fucking awful on me (2023-early 2024 were the worst years for my mental health.) , everything I feared would happen happened, and now I can’t help but worry that this year will be no different due to let downs. I’ve always feared the future, and the arrival of 2025 makes me uneasy, I hate how fast time goes by- I’d do anything to make it slow down for me.

I’ve told my therapist this, but she’s absolutely zero help. (She really never has been, I’m considering dropping her.) 

Is anyone else just…genuinely terrified for the future? Like, do you just kind of expect things to go wrong because that’s what you’re used too? This has been an issue my whole life and I’ve never felt comfortable discussing it with others because they never understand.",Anxiety

"hi everyone!! I hope you're all holding up & practicing self-care during these confusing and difficult times.

I just got diagnosed w GAD, although I've always suspected it but invalidated myself before. I was also prescribed Citalopram (Celexa) 10mg to start with, and I wanted to know if others had experiences with this medication or any anti-anxiety medication. I don't want to get my hopes up too high...I know it won't fix all my problems but I'm afraid I might be expecting too much in terms of relief. I don't even really know what I am expecting if i'm being honest, I guess I just want to know what to expect in case.  I keep imagining this scenario where my Co-workers/friends/family notice I've changed for the better /  enjoy my company more, but I don't know if that is realistic...so I'd rather have that dream shattered rn rather than later lol. I am not too worried about symptoms / side effects because I can always switch meds if that is the case, my psychiatrist is super sweet so I'm not intimidated to bring that up.

"I’ve been suffering from GAD since I was 15, (i’m 19 atm) and even though it was manageable when I got diagnosed, the pandemic triggered my anxiety in ways I couldn’t imagine. I’ve been having nonstop anxiety attacks for 3 months and have suffered from an array of physical symptoms that have never left. I’m now on one month of 20mg prozac and take xanax as needed, and have moved in with my family, which being separated from them in another country made the situation worse. I feel like now i’m in a much more stable position but I still feel like absolute shit. I get daily headaches in the back of my head and temples, my vision hurts and I can’t focus it properly, and my limbs feel extremely weak. Throughout this whole thing I also developed horrible health anxiety and i’m constantly thinking I have a serio disease such as a brain tumor or MS, or even about to have a stroke. I wanted to know if any of you have recovered from extended periods of anxiety and how long was this process, I just want to feel like myself again, everything seems so hard to do.

TL:DR: I’ve been having nonstop anxiety attacks for 3 months and my body is wrecked. I want to know how long till it heals/recovers from chronic tension and anxiety

"background info: i'm a 17 year old female, been diagnosed with GAD and depression and have been taking 20mg of prozac since september.

so i guess this is kind of a question/experience. has anyone else experienced a strong urge to throw up while having anxiety/panic attacks? not in the ""i feel naseous, need to throw up"" way, but more bulimic tendencies like actually scheduling time to go to the restroom at school and making yourself throw up? 

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds. 

(i am not doing this anymore. mostly because my country is in lockdown and i'm at home with my entire family 24/7. our bathroom walls and foors are both made if milk glass and would make descreetly throwing up not very possible.) 

thankfully my anxiety levels have gone down and i'm not feeling that urge anymore, but i am concerned that it will come back if i'm in a stressful situation like that again. so i guess i'm just sharing this to ask if anyone else has had these feelings due to high anxiety. or if this could be a symptom not of my anxiety disorder, but potentially bulimia. 

any comments are welcome and appreciated :)",Anxiety

"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing relatively well. I am the moderator here and I'd like to share a couple of the best solutions I have found to (potentially) overcoming the bulk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

My philosophy is that often a large chunk of the GAD is caused by limiting beliefs. Eliminating the limiting beliefs could potentially wipe out the entire disorder.

Here are the best (free) ways I know how to do this:

1. Faster EFT
2. Lefkoe Method

(There are other ways but you need to hire a practitioner for them. Actually, it's best you hire one for the methods above also, especially if you have big painful memories inside you that you just want to run away from. I am not trained in the above methods, I just believe in them and found them personally transformative. You can, of course, learn to do these yourself for free, read on if this resonates).

Faster EFT operates under the assumption that beliefs come from memories. If you dismantle your unwanted memories, your limiting beliefs vanish also. (Because they came from the memories). An example: someone unexpectedly beat you as a child (this happened to the founder of this method) you change the memory and no longer feel anxiety around people that remind you of that person. If you want to find out more about this method, Robert the founder has over 1000 videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SkillsToChange) showing how to do it, testimonials, troubleshooting tips etc.

The Lefkoe Method (TLM) is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety (for public speaking). It went down from 7/10 to 1.5/10 on average over a handful of sessions (if I recall correctly). TLM focuses on beliefs. Say you feel unworthy, then you may have a limiting belief of ""I'm unworthy"". You go through the one of the processes and realise you never saw evidence of that objectively because the world is 100% neutral at all times. The belief vanishes and you feel lighter immediately. If you want to find out more about this method, go to the r/TheLefkoeMethod sub, there is a pinned post where you can try it immediately. This one I found it quite hard to do, but well worth the time to get the hang of it.

Both of these methods are very powerful and you can do it for free! Profound results not unheard of, such as eliminating trauma from seeing someone killed to being unable to feel bad about it 10 minutes later. Check them out!",Anxiety
"Even if you make deep breaths. When you wake up, always. 

You’re on automatic. 

You cannot really be present. You feel you cannot see, literally see clearly. 

There’s also sometimes clear anxiety, some rumination, sometimes horrible. But this other aspect doesn’t ever change. Never. 

As if you could be on the other side of the world, and you really don’t mind because you can’t clearly notice things. Can’t Be really conscious. 

Be there. Feel, really feel. Enjoy. Have notion of time, space, the world, your family, the people. Know what you’re doing, look back and remember your childhood — any of these. As if you could die tomorrow and it would be the same. Also little reaction to pain. You can probably resist a lot of physical pain—because it feels as if you’re not there.

"I want to hear from people who have this diagnosis. What does it feel like to you. How did it start, and how long has it lasted. What does your day look like.. I’m scared

I’ll explain my situation if anyone wants to read. I had panic disorder when I was a teenager. Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But I’ve never had “normal” anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but I’m not capable of sitting in it. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever had.

"Happened to me(27M, diagnosed with GAD) in April after I met this girl. Instant connection and instant chemistry. Pretty soon after I realised I had fallen in love... I've had crushes before... This was different. I could tell I had fallen in love and it was horrible. I did have waves of euphoria but they were followed by huge amounts of anxiety. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I had to keep moving so I can discharge all that energy. It was terrible. 

Finally when I couldn't take it anymore and I asked the girl on a date. To which she responded that she's engaged and that she's a lesbian.

I should have felt heartbroken, but I felt relieved. Like the nightmare was over and I could breathe again. I had closure.

"Hi everyone, I'm 28 and have been dealing with persistent, severe anxiety symptoms since childhood. I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, near-fainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hyper-vigilance that make daily life a challenge.

I've tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didn’t help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. I’ve also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 24/7 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally.

I’ve spent years undergoing medical tests (MRIs, blood work, specialist visits) to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and I’m being referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

"I just don’t understand where I’m at. I’ve been battling anxiety for 3 years now since college, and while I’ve made progress, I’m not so sure I have. I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help? I have so many good things going on in my life, I hate this. I feel so close to breaking through as well, but then so far.",Anxiety

"I truly hope this post is okay, I'm really needing some help and guidance. I'm currently in a long term relationship with my significant other (32, F) who is diagnosed with generalized anxiety, and depression. I knew about it all before I got into a relationship with her, so there was no surprises or anything. She was very honest with me about what she deals with ahead of time. 

We have been together for a very long time, and I fear she is at her worst point with all of it in her life currently.

She is really struggling with her anxiety, and her depression. She rarely gets out of bed during the week, leaves the house possible once a week. Nothing seems to bring her joy or happiness right now, and I have zero idea how I can help.

I really want to be there for her as much as possible, and I only want to help her, but I just have no idea at all how to do it. If I try to get her to talk about her feelings, or what she is feeling and thinking, she just tells me she is depressed and does not want to be awake. She is constantly anxious as well. Dealing with waves of anxiety throughout the day.

I love her so incredibly much, and I just feel completely helpless because I have not found any supportive tactic that has helped her at all whatsoever. So I am here, asking for ideas, thoughts, things that your significant others do to help you. I want to be as constructive and supporting as I possibly can. Any and all help would mean so much.",Anxiety
"Some background: I'm diagnosed Bipolar (I'm on lithium), OCD, and GAD. My anxiety gets so bad some times that I'll be unable to function in a normal situation. (I once stood at the door of a party and stared at a wall for 10 minutes straight clutching a box. When I finally moved, I perched onto of a chair and curled up around my water bottle. Or I'll refuse to go into buildings my body deems unsafe.) 

Seeing as I live in the New York-  New Jersey area,  I should say life that last month has been atypical.  I'm temporarily displaced from my daily routine and I had to form a new schedule.  And I'm finding in this new, uncertain schedule, my anxiety is getting worse.  

My psychiatrist and I started an approach 2-ish years ago, to control the bipolar disorder.  And that has leveled off.  But now that we are here, in quarantine (shelter in place) I'm so anxious.  Does anyone have any tips on how to talk to my psychiatrist? I 'see"" her on Monday. I've started journaling when I have panic attacks and what triggered them and if it's related to an OCD episode or not.  But is there anything I should be including? I rarely talk fo her about anxiety, and if we do it's not really a problem.  I know reddit wont know what my psychiatrist will ask, but if you could help me prepare for the questions so I'll have appropriate answers, that would be awesome.  



Some of the fears focus on: 
Interpersonal relationships (mainly I just entered a new relationship and I'm head over heels for him and I'm terrified I'm not enough. And my best friends leaving me because I'm ""crazy."" As I put it.) 

My life in general (am I in the right field, how do I maximize my career, am I doing the right thing?) 

Being/doing enough (this one is very very steady in my life.  My parents always pushed me to do more and often punished rest.  So now that in home 24/7, I spend the day from 10am-5PM cleaning and doing housework and trying to progress my future. And then I make dinner for my family, clean and walk the dogs.

"Hi everyone This is my first reddit post so I’m not sure if This is the right spot to post but I have generalized anxiety disorder. It started a year ago when I was working as a waitress. I would get super dizzy nauseous and my heart would start racing. I thought it happened because I had a high stress job but I started to feel the symptoms out of work at stores, family events, driving, being alone in public etc. I got to the point where I started to isolate myself from everything. 
       I quit my job and made my boyfriend go into stores for me and getting takeout. He came and sat in the parking lot while I was in classes. Since then I’ve been seeing a therapist and taking buspar and propranolol. I’ve been pretty good about going into stores now with my boyfriend and I can go into gas stations sometimes if I’m feeling good. I just think I’m at the point where I want to hang with my friends and they kind of understand how I’m feeling but I’m nervous to spend time with them without my boyfriend or go and do anything without him for that matter. My therapist wants me to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own but I get panic attacks. 
    I get a light headed heart racing feeling when I drive so I always worry about that happening. It’s the scariest experience. I vape which I know doesn’t help it but does anyone have any advice on how I can break out of my shell and become more social again?

"Honestly, I hate the thought of going back to therapy.

The last therapist I had talked about mystical forces and his office was in an old church. Surprisingly, that didn’t end up being a great match.

The one before him quit scheduling appointments for me because I “don’t have real problems”. Okay.

But I know I need to do something. I’m holding in a lot of pain and I don’t know how to get rid of it. Maybe therapy. Maybe a medication. It needs to be something, I know that.

Im trying to do my research so I don’t end up where I started.  Kinda difficult to pick the person that can get my brain back on track from a google search though, let me say that.

Whoever I find, I hope they work quick because the only way this is possible is by running out my HSA and hoping I never get sick sick and need it.

Possibly the worst part of anxiety and depression is being crazy, but still sane enough to know that what you’re doing is fucked up.

"Hey

Hoping for some advice. 

Was on cipralex for 7 years and it allowed me to be happy and live life. Then it stopped working! I was on a high dose. 

Since then, have tried:

Fetzima- gave me heart palpitations and high BP
Lyrica- kept breaking through despite upped doses
Propranalol- just made me tired, no other effects 
Trintellix-just didn’t feel good on it after 2 months. No real change to my mood. 

Currently on 300mg of Trileptal which is a mood stabilizer, and not doing so well. 

My thoughts are to try another SSRI such as Zoloft or Prozac, given how well Cipralex worked for me.  Or, try another SSRI, perhaps Pristiq, cymbalta or Effexor. 

I don’t like cocktails of meds, as I find it’s impossible to know what’s doing what. I think my last cocktail made me worse. 

I generally react OK to these meds..

"Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent.

I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either.

"I wanted to share my experience and possibly get some advice. Ever since I was little, I remeber having spells of intense fear and panic for no reason that would last for days at a time. I would get this feeling in the pit of my stomach and then my body would get hot and I would know that I was going through it again. Fast foward to my late teen years, I got put on Sertraline, which seemed to help a lot with the racing thoughts and overall feeling of panic and dread. Occasionally I would still get this feeling, but it would go away within a couple hours or maybe a day at most. After about 5 years on Sertraline (getting it from the same pharmacy) my family changed our prescriptions to come from an online pharmacy. Now, I’m not sure if this is why I’m spiraling and having these intense feelings of fear and distress, but I think the addatives in the pill may be different and that is why I’m going thought this right now. I’ll be at work, with heart palpitations, a tight chest and shoulders, sweating, and an intense feeling of fear and depression for no reason. It’s like my body is in a constant state of fight or flight and I can’t seem to escape it. 

I guess my point of this post is to ask if anyone else can relate to these random feelings of fear and eeriness. Sertraline really seemed to help me this last few years, so I’m hoping switching back to my original pharmacist will help elevate this distress. I’m trying so hard to stay strong, but this is hell. I am home in my bed, but for some reason I’m scared and afraid.. doesn’t help I live in the middle of the woods lmao. 

For those who experience these intense feelings, are there any medications that have reduced your panic and anxiety? Are benzos something to look into?

"Hi everyone, my name is Anna.

I am currently working with a team of scientists who have developed a new lithium salt — lithium ascorbate. Our research shows that it has the potential to become an alternative to currently used compounds, as it demonstrates significant effectiveness with lower toxicity.

Lithium is widely known as a first-choice treatment for mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. This has created an image of lithium as a ""last resort"" for severe cases.

However, lithium is an essential element for the normal functioning of all body systems and, most importantly, the brain. The human body requires 0.7 mg of lithium per day for proper functioning. Without it, the risk of various mental health conditions increases. 

The findings of our research have been published in an article in the journal *Molecules*. Below is a brief summary, and you can read the full text via this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2253).

What did we find out?

* Lithium ascorbate prevents the reabsorption of dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) by neurons, which helps increase their levels and prolong their action, resulting in a stable good mood;
* Lithium ascorbate increases cell survival under conditions of glutamate stress. It enhances the regenerative capacity and formation of new connections among neurons within the central nervous system; 
* Lithium ascorbate prevents glutamate stress, which leads to anxiety disorders;
* Lithium ascorbate is characterized by low acute and chronic toxicity; it is safe even when used in high doses.

According to the article, we can conclude that lithium ascorbate is a safer substance to support our mental health, with the same or even better effects than commonly used lithium carbonate.

If you're curious about how lithium ascorbate could revolutionize mental health support or have questions about its potential benefits, let's start a conversation! What are your thoughts on this next-gen lithium salt?

"TW: mention of self harm. 

i’ve been having a rough 3 weeks with my anxiety. for some background, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at a young age. when i was in high school i was prescribed lexapro by a doctor who worked in the adolescent medicine department of the children’s hospital near me (on the hospital website it stated that she specializes in anxiety disorders and more). i was on lexapro for 3 years. those 3 years had to have been the darkest and hardest years of my life. i felt like a total zombie, struggled heavy with depression, terrible mood swings, my insomnia was at its worst, and i even developed suicidal thoughts which led me to hurt myself. throughout the time i was seeing this doctor, i would literally tell her the honest truth about what i was dealing with & she never took me off of the medication & just kept prescribing higher dosages. when i graduated high school and moved to college, i decided to stop taking the lexapro cold turkey & man when i tell yall i had never felt that amazing in my entire life. since then i would have my moments. i’d deal with my occasional panic attacks, when triggered, but it wasn’t until last fall (september 2023) where i started to have random anxiety attacks. it wasn’t severe, at first it was rough and i decided to go home for a few weeks but then i felt better and moved on. now fast forward to now. early december of this past year, i started to feel HEAVY feelings of anxiety, so heavy they felt as horrible as they did when i was first diagnosed (back then my anxiety was extremely severe). i ignored the feelings, but it wasn’t until 3 weeks ago on sunday january 12th where i just exploded. since then ive been having random anxiety attacks throughout the day, im not eating, and im not sleeping at night bc ill be up having anxiety attacks or my mind just won’t let me sleep. it’s been so bad that i haven’t been able to go to work. i moved back home this past school year so my mom has been helping me through this and we found me a new psychiatrist. i had my appointment today and she brought up the option of taking medication to try and help me. she mentioned how Sertraline is her favorite medication to prescribe her patients bc for the most part all of her patients have reacted very well & said it was a game changer. she also mentioned how she didn’t agree with how my last doctor approached my situation with the lexapro (which made me feel like maybe i could trust her), but after that experience i am extremely terrified to even try medication again….i did some research and even searched up videos on tiktok bc i rather hear about peoples experiences since i think that means more than research. so if anyone has been diagnosed with GAD and takes Sertraline (without any other medications), pls let me know what your experience has been like!! i really want to get better, im starting therapy next week first & i’ll go from there.

Then I was recreation assistant and again with large people flow. I hated my days on the job but I was still doing it because I needed money.

Another example- oh how I hated school- I was too sensitive and even getting headaches from the noise levels during breaks. But homeschooling wasn’t and option, I haven’t thought about such option until covid lockdowns.

One more example- I have suffocating sensation from my anxiety. But I applied for the job during Covid and I worked in a mask, which also made my glasses foggy. As much as it was bothering me I kept working there because that was the plan. I would stop in my ways and grab the bread shelves I was loading, people walking around me, and I was gasping for air trying to make an inhale, sometimes for the duration of couple of minutes, and no one cared. So didn’t I. But those were low-key panic attacks.

So it was horrible to live through such daunting conditions for me, I developed burnout and went into major depressive episode after few years like so, but now I know I am capable to adapt and live however will be required…


And when something is bothering me, I pretent to myself that I sort of don’t have this problem.
I treat my struggles as a game and brush them off. Not escaping though- I acknowledge that I have it and kind of playfully challenge myself, asking, so what? 

(Of course it isn’t foolproof and doesn’t work during full-on depressive episode).",Anxiety

"Long story short, 29 F, diagnosed with GAD and CPTSD in 2018. Currently no health insurance. I was prescribed Fluoxetine 20 mg BID and  Buspirone 5 mg AS NEEDED in 2023 by a Nurse Practitioner at a regular physical exam that I had mentioned my worsening anxiety and suicidal ideations.  I had previously been prescribed Fluoxetine 30 mg BID and Alprazolam 0.5 BID OR as needed, which worked for a while, was presribed by my last psychiatrist but had lost insurance coverage and could no longer see her. My question is, is Buspirone actually effective as needed? I've been overall good with my anxiety and stuff but EVERY time I get my period I have horrible anxiety and moods swings. I'm looking for something to take off the edge or give me something since I don't have health coverage currently. Everything I have found online says that it needs to build up in my system. So, why would it be prescribed to me to be taken as needed?? ",Anxiety

"So I only joined and started contributing to Reddit recently, if anyone looks up my profile, you can see I mostly posted in cUTI and anxiety topics. I have the worst health anxiety and GAD so I've obviously always been googling everything before Reddit as well. And while there are tons of useful tips and shared experiences I can find here, I also noticed that reading about other people's stories sometimes creates even worse scenarios in my head. If a comment is not reassuring, my anxiety spikes again. After all, we have no clue who's posting and saying what, all our experiences can be vastly different.
So I'm kind of thinking about deleting this app because I tend to check it out now every time my phone's in my hand, like when I mindlessly scroll social media (probably should delete those apps too). And I can genuinely feel that's not great for my mental health.
Anybody feels anything similar? What do you think?",Anxiety
"hi, i was diagnosed with GAD when i was 8 years old, im now 20 and currently feeling the same way i would feel when my anxiety was at it’s prime all because i’m seeing scary things on the news & social media. when i was first diagnosed my therapist would tell me parents to try to avoid me from watching the news and certain movies/tv shows of natural disasters or anything that can set me off, so this isn’t new, but i thought that i may have already moved passed that trigger. as i grew up, i learned to just not let outer events affect me and to just chill, but for the past few weeks it’s felt like i’m 8 years old again dealing with the scariest and worst feelings of anxiety. 

today it got pretty bad, for i had to leave my long distance boyfriend to come back home after visiting him for 2 weeks and all i could think about was the fear of it possibly being our last goodbye all bc lately my social media has been flooded with passings of loved ones, natural disasters, talk of war, etc. i stopped going to therapy in high school because i just never found the right therapist, and it’s just so expensive. i’m not on any medications anymore either, i was on lexapro for around 3 yrs & it turned me into a total depressed suicidal zombie. 

i guess im just looking for reassurance that this isn’t just something that happens to me and i guess tips on how to try to move past this? i’m a 20 yr old college student who’s also in a sorority studying marketing soooo deleting social media isn’t rlly an option. i’ve tried blocking countless news accounts on all of my socials, yet i keep finding these terrible things. it also doesn’t help that it’s most of these topics are normal conversation at the moment. :,) ",Anxiety
"Hello everyone. It is like i know what i want to do in life but my mind gets distracted in other directions therefore i have to give reasons to myself to not believe in distractions. If i cant think of reasons to eliminate distraction it will constantly be in my head. Just cant clear my mind, really confused, fighting my own thoughts. For instance i know i want to go for mba and prepare for cat but a thought of govt exams comes in my mind. Here i l know that at last i only want to prepare for cat but my mind gets tricked in thoughts of govt job like you’ll have good work life balance, you can earn under the table money. In contrast you,ll not be able to enjoy these things in corporate. But for sure in back of mind i know that these are just unusual thoughts and i’ll not go for govt jobs but unless i give myself solid reasons to eliminate the thought of govt jobs i cant move ahead. First i have to clear my mind from it. In total distractions come and i cant get them off unless i give myself solid reasons.",Anxiety

"Hi everyone, my name is Anna.

I am currently working with a team of scientists who have developed a new lithium salt — lithium ascorbate. Our research shows that it has the potential to become an alternative to currently used compounds, as it demonstrates significant effectiveness with lower toxicity.

Lithium is widely known as a first-choice treatment for mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. This has created an image of lithium as a ""last resort"" for severe cases.

However, lithium is an essential element for the normal functioning of all body systems and, most importantly, the brain. The human body requires 0.7 mg of lithium per day for proper functioning. Without it, the risk of various mental health conditions increases. 

The findings of our research have been published in an article in the journal *Molecules*. Below is a brief summary, and you can read the full text via this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2253).

What did we find out?

* Lithium ascorbate prevents the reabsorption of dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) by neurons, which helps increase their levels and prolong their action, resulting in a stable good mood;
* Lithium ascorbate increases cell survival under conditions of glutamate stress. It enhances the regenerative capacity and formation of new connections among neurons within the central nervous system; 
* Lithium ascorbate prevents glutamate stress, which leads to anxiety disorders;
* Lithium ascorbate is characterized by low acute and chronic toxicity; it is safe even when used in high doses.

According to the article, we can conclude that lithium ascorbate is a safer substance to support our mental health, with the same or even better effects than commonly used lithium carbonate.

If you're curious about how lithium ascorbate could revolutionize mental health support or have questions about its potential benefits, let's start a conversation! What are your thoughts on this next-gen lithium salt?

"Hello. I know what i want to do in life but still cant come out of intrusive thoughts(distraction). For example if i see some cringe content creator(such as one doing cheap pranks in public or doing dance in public) and he/she is getting views(fame) for that then i feel the thing they are doing dont require any hard work or struggle. Basically it feels like they are earning easy money. And i gets distracted. For me to come over this distraction i have to give reasons to myself that it is only distraction. It feels like i have so many choices to earn money in life very easily. I am consulting a psychatrist from last 6 month he told me its gad and ocd but there is no improvement from medications.

Also i resarched a lot but my type of ocd dont fit in any category. I cant find anyone facing similar problem

"Hi! Has anyone here had oral conscious sedation at the dentist for a root canal or possible extraction or both? I have had iv sedation before for 2 extractions 2 farthest back upper teeth. I don’t remember much but at one time lifting my hand to cover my face. The dentist called me that evening to say all went well but I was a bit resistant even with the iv sedation. But that he thinks I can do the root canal I need with just pills. This was a year ago. My anxiety was much more controlled then. At this moment it is not controlled and I wonder if pills would be enough. Depending how my appt goes tomorrow I’ll be told if I need the root canal or extraction. Or both, root canal and/or extraction for a tooth up front and one wisdom tooth extraction that’s fully erupted upper left. I also don’t have insurance right now so I really would hope the pills work because it’s much cheaper. Idk if they remember me from a year ago or not but I’m going to remind them I’m THAT anxious patient. I need my rescue med ,Xanax just to physically get to this appt tomorrow. 😩 I have GAD and panic disorder.",Anxiety
"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing relatively well. I am the moderator here and I'd like to share a couple of the best solutions I have found to (potentially) overcoming the bulk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

My philosophy is that often a large chunk of the GAD is caused by limiting beliefs. Eliminating the limiting beliefs could potentially wipe out the entire disorder.

Here are the best (free) ways I know how to do this:

1. Faster EFT
2. Lefkoe Method

(There are other ways but you need to hire a practitioner for them. Actually, it's best you hire one for the methods above also, especially if you have big painful memories inside you that you just want to run away from. I am not trained in the above methods, I just believe in them and found them personally transformative. You can, of course, learn to do these yourself for free, read on if this resonates).

Faster EFT operates under the assumption that beliefs come from memories. If you dismantle your unwanted memories, your limiting beliefs vanish also. (Because they came from the memories). An example: someone unexpectedly beat you as a child (this happened to the founder of this method) you change the memory and no longer feel anxiety around people that remind you of that person. If you want to find out more about this method, Robert the founder has over 1000 videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SkillsToChange) showing how to do it, testimonials, troubleshooting tips etc.

The Lefkoe Method (TLM) is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety (for public speaking). It went down from 7/10 to 1.5/10 on average over a handful of sessions (if I recall correctly). TLM focuses on beliefs. Say you feel unworthy, then you may have a limiting belief of ""I'm unworthy"". You go through the one of the processes and realise you never saw evidence of that objectively because the world is 100% neutral at all times. The belief vanishes and you feel lighter immediately. If you want to find out more about this method, go to the r/TheLefkoeMethod sub, there is a pinned post where you can try it immediately. This one I found it quite hard to do, but well worth the time to get the hang of it.

Both of these methods are very powerful and you can do it for free! Profound results not unheard of, such as eliminating trauma from seeing someone killed to being unable to feel bad about it 10 minutes later. Check them out!",Anxiety

"I still don’t have my GAD and panic under control. I’ve been afraid to really venture out. Even though I’m trying to leave the house more often. My daily symptoms are heart palpitations, shortness of breath and this lump on throat feeling that makes me feel like I’m choking / want to gag. I feel this at home off and on but have panic attacks at stores, etc. About a week ago. I had a great day and came and went to Walmart without a panic attack. My point is I haven’t worked since August because of this anxiety and panic. I lost my full time 14 year job due to the supervisors wanting to demote me because of my anxiety. I left out of too much pride, and then I got a high school receptionist job a month later and had a panic attack when the student came back to school. Now in my small hometown, a few blocks from my house is a job opening. Good pay and good health insurance. It’s for the county I used to work for that I’d have to commute to. Just different dept and office. I used to be a court clerk for district court for 14 yrs but this job would be a secretary job for the local county road and bridge commissioner. And it’d be walking distance from me. I really want to apply but I’m so afraid. I NEED a full time job again. I’m afraid the symptoms of anxiety and panic will cause me to need to run to the bathroom or run out side and keep me from my job. I won’t have anywhere to “hide” anymore. Like I have been doing at home. Before this opening came up. I was thinking of doing something like delivering for Amazon. Where there would be less public interaction. Idk what to do.
