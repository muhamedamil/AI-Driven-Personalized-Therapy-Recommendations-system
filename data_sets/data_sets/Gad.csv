0,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
1,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,

2,"I’m listening to all romantic songs in my YouTube playlist. My father has gone out, telling me that he’ll be back in 15 minutes. Now imagine a normal 21 year old here, for her/him it would be normal. But right now I have imagined all possible worse case scenarios happening to my dad (I’m not proud of them but they don’t stop coming), I can feel my heart beat faster and pounding against my chest. I try to tell myself that its okay and it will be, and the best distraction for me to not dwell into all the worst things I have imagined is calling my boyfriend, which is every time and most of the times he is not available. I don’t usually tell him that I’m a nut case. But we talk about every other thing but my anxiety. Sometimes when I’am sleepless and on a verge of panic attack, I tell him mild things I think about. Not all. Just a bit here and there.
I have to share: is something I read about in an psychology article. Otherwise before him, I never told anyone about.
In India only some people know about having anxiety. And some live with it. I haven’t seen a psychiatrist yet, it’s a costly affair including medicines. I haven’t self diagnosed myself. But if you lived inside my mind, you’d know something is wrong with me.
Sometimes, when I’am having a panic attack, I cut. Not deep, just abrasions. It feels so good to turn mental pain into a physical one. I cannot describe the relief that surges in after doing it. I don’t want to die or kill myself, if you are worried about it. I just cannot cap my feelings sometimes. And I really don’t want anyone calling me, “overly sensitive”, “attention- seeker”, etc. I just started telling people like my best friend, but even she calls me a nut case and wacko. She says it’s all in my head. Like I don’t know. I know that even my boyfriend cannot understand what I feel, I don’t push him much.
My anxiety has doubled itself in past few years. Now even flight trips and regular college tests trigger panic attacks.
It’s bad. I really don’t want to feel and think sometimes at all,",GAD
3,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

5,"For most of my life my anxiety corresponded to CPTSD. It would get triggered when I was around certain people or expected to do certain things. Because my CPTSD was so deep, the anxiety was triggered mostly by relationships and intimacy. My mind would suddenly tell me that I was going to be suffocated (emotionally) by the friend or potential beau and then I would get anxiety about the impending suffocation. I would feel trapped by relationships in circumstances that are completely benign and normal - like going to the movies with a new boyfriend in 8th grade. Instead of just going in to watch a movie next to him and possible hold his hand (whoa), I had a panic attack and spent the entire two hours on the pay phone talking to a friend. It was awful because I didn’t know what was going on and had basically resigned myself to being broken, to the fact that I would never be able to have a relationship because I could never get past the initial stages. This anxiety is NOT generalized anxiety.
Then I got into a relationship with a person (15 years later) who cheated on me and didn’t feel the need to help mend the trust issues surrounding that when we got back together. I was put on medication for Generalized Anxiety and Severe Depression. I should have been put on the regime of “Break up with the guy who won’t meet you half way and blames you for all of it.” This also, is NOT Generalized Anxiety, even though that’s what they diagnosed me with. This is a normal reaction to a crap situation.
Again, this did not feel like Generalized Anxiety because I would feel fine for days and then be triggered by a trust breach or some other interpersonal trigger.
Last year, however, my body gave up. Rightly so, I was in four accidents over the course of just about one month, including being thrown from a horse in a different country and having had a car crash with my dogs in the car. I’d also had Lasik just before all of these and was very nervous about it. All that to say, my nervous system was shot. I was having such a hard time with my whiplash and scapula fracture that I stopped sleeping. I thought it was just pain and the healing process. But I had severe generalized anxiety. I actually wasn’t aware of this until I tried smoking a little weed on New Years Eve a couple months later, and the anxiety suddenly shut off. For 4 hours, I felt no anxiety, no fear of people nudging me, no worry of being suffocated, no negative self talk, and no physical, jittery panic.
So I have felt what it feels like to have severe anxiety one day, and absolutely none the next.
For me, anxiety feels like having that extra cup of coffee you shouldn’t have had, then walking outside and seeing a car crash or having someone surprisingly grab you from behind and brusquely yelp, AHH!
It’s that feeling constantly. So, when someone without anxiety sees a car crash, or drinks too much coffee, or is scared by someone else, generally the person can rely on their body to get over the scared feeling after a little while. Not when you have anxiety. It’s constant. Sometimes you don’t know what’s triggered it, and sometimes it lasts for days. It’s exhausting. You’re well aware that other people or public situations may trigger the anxiety and you become embarrassed about it, which triggers it tenfold. You feel like your nervous system has it out for you.
One time during this severe anxiety episode my boyfriend and I were at a resort where they played music at the pool all day. Our room was unfortunately right above the pool. 7am until 6pm the DJ played techno or dance music with the bass cranked. For me, it had the effect of nails on a chalkboard or someone thwapping the top of your head with flat fingertips over and over again. It became so intense that I found myself huddled in the shower with as many doors closed between me and the sound as I could close. I was exhausted and trapped and awake. Luckily, we were able to move rooms.
Anxiety feels like you’re “turned on” all the time.
If you were to plug headphones into a jack on an amp, you would hear the reverb sound of electricity as a dull electronic hum. Generalized Anxiety is feeling that hum in your body all the time.
It’s also psychologically exhausting. It makes you not trust yourself because it’s your own thoughts that can also make it worse or make it last for days. Negative self talk plagues a lot of people, but if you have generalized anxiety you are acutely aware of them and fall victim to them even more. One thought about your lover possibly lying to you or your not being able to pay a bill can open the floodgates of anxiety for hours. Just like when you are sitting in an older house, and, when someone turns on the shower upstairs, you hear the rumble of water moving through the pipes above your head; when a negative thought hits, the well of cortisol and adrenaline bursts and you can feel it course through your arms and legs, your face and stomach, becoming instantly frazzled, frantic, and exhausted.
Generalized anxiety suggests a dysfunction in your parasympathetic nervous system. Your sympathetic nervous system is constantly turned on, and your parasympathetic system has failed to counterbalance it for you.
So throughout the course of a day, a normal person can have excitement and thrills and worries and troubles, but they don’t even notice that the body is able to take those “ups” and bring them back down. General anxiety makes it unpredictable and at times impossible to come down from these “ups”, positive or negative.
Anyone who’s reading this and has not ever felt this level of anxiety, please empathize with those who have. They are not copping out or creating a psycho-somatic illness. They are trying and probably have tried everything they can possibly think of to lessen the pain and exhaustion, to just feel nothing for once. Just know that they are fighting an inner war, and may only need someone to say,
I can’t fathom your pain, but
I’m proud of your courage.
I’m proud of you for not giving up.
You’ll figure it out one of these days.",GAD
6,"Living life with GAD is almost like being sucked up in a black hole everyday.
My first wish to god is that PLEASE never let anyone go through this hell ever again.
Living life with GAD is almost as though you have all thoughts and efforts always thinking about the worst in every aspect of life with happiness never in sight. There is no motivation towards things that we enjoyed on a daily basis. Therefore, depression is a constant companion as well. Plus the burden of seeing people happy around weighs us down. It is a wretched condition.
Antipsychotics are not doing any magic to me. They are just helping me in keeping me afloat. My biggest anxiety is about my health. I always feel like I am having a stroke. It is taking the pleasure out everyday. But I am fighting it. The worst part is that no one around can understand us.
Hope the world understands anxiety better in the coming days.",GAD
7,"I hail from a country that does not understand the term general anxiety disorder. It is unfortunately considered as a normal thing and is labeled as stubbornness..
There are broadly three types of attachment behavior... Anxious, secure and avoidant. Typically all people are combinations and it would be wrong to label them or generalize just one type in a person because it also depends on circumstance and situation that a person is in at a particular moment. However, in order to explain the three types, I shall generalize the three types...
Consider this situation... there is a baby in a room playing with his mother. His mother suddenly leaves... Here's how the three types of children would react
Anxious: This child would cry loudly when his mother comes back. when comforted, he would continue to cry angry about being left alone in the first place! It is difficult to deal with this kind of child
Secure: This child would cry when his mother leaves but is comforted very easily
Avoidant: This baby acts as if nothing happened, though experimental results of his heart rate show that he is affected internally
Having explained the three types of attachment behavior, let's go on to when anxiety is identified
Anxiety signs can be identified during childhood. A perfectly normal child with caring parents can show signs of anxiety. This is because the child is born with the disorder. The cause of this could be genetic (from parents or ancestors) or congenital (from birth)
During the course of a person's life, there are many things that s/he faces. These have an effect on the mind. One of the effects could be anxiety. Any form of abuse or trauma physical/emotional/sexual that affects the person's mental state could result in anxiety. Peer pressure, pressure due to academics, humiliation by teachers/bosses affect also result in anxiety.
Now that we have discussed possible causes, I come to answer the crux of your question.. what is it like to have general anxiety disorder?
An anxious person can never be fully controlled of her / his emotions. In the sense, you don't know what her/his next reaction is going to be. A seemingly normal person might react in a violent way to a simple comment or joke that may not even have been directed towards him/her. Most often, since these people have very low self-morales, the emotional outburst is followed by a string of apologies. Often loaded with intensity. The person who faces this outburst is often at a loss for words and does not know how to react. As a result, these people facing the outburst get scared of the anxious person...
Seems scary right? However, there are ways to treat general anxiety disorder. For both innate and acquired. However, one needs to be willing to work on oneself. I have explained a step by step way of doing so:
1. Accept that you have general anxiety disorder: Until and unless one accepts an issue, one can never overcome it. One needs to be honest with oneself
2. If uncontrollable, take professional psychologists' help to overcome the root cause of your anxiety: Most often the born anxious people are likely to face more severe symptoms of GAD. And these are the people who get affected by other people's behaviour toward them in a more intense way. It is important to identify the root cause of anxiety
3. Work on letting go of the root causes: Let go... this is a term very difficult to implement. It is even more difficult for anxious people. So an anxious person needs to take extra efforts to let go of the past. Forgive and forget. Each person can do this in her/his own way. Take up a new hobby to improve self-worth, resort to meditation, play sports or games... but importantly, try to keep your mind out of the activity.
4. Understand the importance of silence and proactivity - stop, take a step back: Anxious people react rather than respond to situations. This makes their behavior go out of hand. When someone says something to you, stop. don't say anything. Think of a what if situation... if you said this... things would go out of hand, do you want that? no. So just don't say anything.
5. Learn to be assertive: This in my opinion is the toughest. In the previous step, I said silence was important. However, the silence must not be taken for granted or be read as 'you are weak'! Say what you want to say to the person calmly. with no intensity. Be gentle, but firm. Rehearse it many times if you must.
6. Make steps 1-5 a part of your daily life routine. In order to do this, you must tell yourself, I want my loved ones to be happy with me and not scared!!
Before completing my answer, I would like to add the difference between people suffering from general anxiety disorder (GAD) and people who might get anxious in certain situations. People with GAD react to any situation, be it home, work or anywhere else. The intensity becomes higher each time. On the other hand, people who get anxious in certain situations might react that way due to fear. For instance a mother might be anxious about her child's health, so she may react abnormally. But that is a one-time thing.
If you feel you have GAD or have been diagnosed with it, do not fear. It is treatable and it is your choice to lead a happy and normal life by working with yourself!",GAD
8,"I am 42 and have had generalized anxiety disorder since I was a toddler.
What's it like for me? Well, imagine having a brain that is in constant overdrive. You cannot stop worrying about things you can't control. You have no ability to live in the moment; your brain is always thinking ahead. The idea of ""relaxing"" is pretty much foreign to you.
You worry about things that will never happen. You worry about your job, your love life, your health, your friends, your parents. Despite the fact that 99% of the time the things that worry you shouldn't, you don't learn from experience.
Anxiety has a horrible consequence in your life. It never really goes away -- when I'm on medication or during high points in my life, it's still there as ambient noise. When i am off medication and I hit a bad point in my life, it becomes horrible. I cannot sleep and will stay up for 48 hours at a time, and I can't eat.
That's what anxiety is like.",GAD
9,"I am a 49 divorced man with two great children and a good job that is not too demanding and that I generally enjoy. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder at 29 but likely have had it all my life. At its worst, I have a feeling of dread that is always with me in some form. For me it almost always a fear loss.
Like a strong feeling like my dog will die. Not right now, but even 15 years from now scares me. I just can't seem to accept the fact that he will die and that I will die. Then I waste tremendous amounts of energy trying to solve the unsolvable. I ruminate and ruminate. I actually lost a pet two years ago and grieved normally and moved on. I have also lost grandparents with whom I was especially close. These actual experiences with death were easier to deal with. Even, if I have learned from these experiences my anxiety appears to be the same.
I have been on medication for 20 years and in therapy for 30 years. The medication has helped to some degree. I would say my feelings of dread seem controllable most of the time and I feel like I can be a good father, son and employee. But, then I have episodes that creep up on me like this weekend. Nothing bad was happening in my external world. As a matter of fact, I just got a bonus and was able to fix some damage to my car. I woke up Saturday morning with a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. This is the same feeling that I have had thousands of times before but it always feels new and dangerous.
My only thought is to make it go away. It feels life threatening. But, I don't know how to get rid of it. Nothing has ever really helped me get out this state except the passage of time. I've tried to explain it to family and friends. My wife was as supportive as she could be but when it's a bright beautiful day at the beach and your acting like your best friend just died, where do you go from there.
I also want to say that I always had the belief that this would go away if I had the right job, the right wife, the right friends, etc. But, it doesn't. Those factors probably do affect regular stress and happiness but not the core anxiety. I wish I had a solution. It ebbs and flows and I really need to appreciate the times that it is only a background nuisance. The last time I experienced a spike like this was in December and I was snapped out of it by the untimely death of a co-worker.
I was living in my head then this horrible external event happened. Living in the external world, even the undesirable and tragic parts is better that being tortured in your own head.",GAD
10,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
11,"To have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder is to live everyday with constant anxiety. What makes it ""Generalized"" is that the subject or ""cause"" of the anxiety is arbitrary. It is normal and natural to experience anxiety about certain things in our lives. Public Speaking and job interviews tend to top the lists of most common causes of normal anxiety. When you are anxious about those things, your mind is on overdrive working through all the possible scenarios and embarrassments, and you may also experience physical discomfort like dry-mouth, excessive sweating, a pit in your stomach, and nausea, among other things. It is considered to be a pretty uncomfortable experience, to say the least. However, most people only think about anxiety within the context of the thing causing it (that speech, for example), or that time your loved-one was in that car crash and you didn't know anything about their condition until you got to the hospital (and what a nightmare that whole experience was). You might have even experienced, or heard anecdotally, that the ""not-knowing"" was the worst part, because at least once you had some details you could begin the process of coping with the reality. Well, that terrible state of ""not-knowing"" is the essence of anxiety. It can be sort of an odd thing to think about being in that state without the understandable triggering event, but what an anxiety disorder is, in very simple terms, is when that trigger is MUCH more sensitive than normal, and in many cases can get stuck in the ""on"" position. Those feelings are caused by chemical reactions in your body and brain as a response to your brain's processing of a certain situation in the physical world. In that way, you can see that there is a ""pairing"" aspect between a state that your brain perceives and the feelings then associated with that perception. In a generalized anxiety disorder, there is an unnaturally elevated presence of the feelings (could be thought of maybe like a leaky ""seal"") and so the brain will then have to pair up things on it's own because it doesn't know what else to do (it is programmed to have those feelings associated with some undesirable ""state""). So with GAD it is the pervasive presence of the feelings of anxiety due to a chemical imbalance that is the cause of paired thinking. Let's go back to that car crash example. Someone you don't know calls you and says ""are you the brother/sister/wife/husband/parent of X? they have been in a high speed auto collision and are being airlifted to Hospital Y, that's all I can tell you."" and then they hang up. At this moment, whatever else is happening in your life has stopped immediately, your mind cranks up into over drive an the only thing you can think about is this person. ""will they be okay? What if they die? What will I tell their friends? What will I do? No, no, don't think like that, they'll be okay. What if they never walk again? Do I need to take anything with me to the hospital?"" Try if you will, to really imagine this, what it would feel like, if you haven't had the misfortune of actually experiencing it. The rest of the world seems to go on like normal, but everything else is secondary to this over-arching ""thing"". Few people, I would think, would take the time to dress their hair up or ponder over which pair of shoes to wear with their outfit... Additionally, let's say, on the way to the hospital your pal calls you to ask for some advice on an up-coming meeting. I'd venture it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to re-focus your attention towards the details of your pal's queries while you're currently wondering whether or not your loved one is going to die. I wanted to really focus on this example because one of the most crippling aspects of an anxiety disorder is that it literally hijacks your brain into spending a lot of time and energy worrying about things that make no sense to worry about. I was diagnosed with a severe generalized anxiety disorder 12 years ago. I've been taking medication for about 10 years now so I'm getting better (and yes it takes 10 years or longer, depending on the severity and type, to ""heal"" from an anxiety disorder because it is such a complex thing, the brain). You can tell now that I have been able to successfully compartmentalize the disorder from myself and my identity. However, even after I was able to rationally defeat certain worries in my head, I was still not able to stop the intrusive worries. To someone who has not been diagnosed or is unaware of their condition, GAD is basically a living nightmare where you are always overwhelmed with the fear of some great unknown... and your mind will generate subjects to attach the worry to. For example, I used to worry constantly that I was suicidal, or could be suicidal... that makes no sense... someone who is actually suicidal is considering ending their own life, but I was only worried about how bad it would be to consider ending my own life, while at no point actually considering it. See? My brain concocted an artificial paradox that couldn't be empirically tested beyond constantly inwardly harassing myself (as opposed to, say, worrying that my pants would be unzipped at tomorrow's meeting and everyone would see it... as I could take measures to ensure that my pants were zipped, by zipping them...) My example is relatively severe, some people can just be excessively worried about things that are normal to worry about, but to such an extent that it interferes with normal life activities. However, things like ""excessive"" and ""normal"" can get fuzzy in many instances and mental disorders can intermix with each other with varying symptoms being more or less prominent depending upon the individual. Which is why all disorders exist on a spectrum and can be complicated to diagnose. This was just the little abridged version of my personal experience (very abridged), but maybe, hopefully, someone somewhere could be able to benefit from my take on it.",GAD
12,"I tend to feel like I’m in a war zone.
There’s rapid fire all around me. I can’t trust anyone. My heart is pounding, my eyes darting around in fear. All you have to do is make it to the door, Aspen. Just make it to the door.
I stretch my hand out for the door, but it seems to get farther and farther away the closer I get. A nasty voice whispers in my head, You’ll be late. They’ll hate you. You’re a failure. Remember when you. . . ?
I kneel to the ground, clutching my head in my hands. I can’t do this. The voice is right. I’m a failure.

Okay, so that’s a little bit of an exaggeration (but not too much of one).
The littlest things can set off my anxiety. Anything from someone scaring me to loud, crowded places to one-on-one confrontation.
I’ve got friends who say, “Wow, Aspen! You’re so alert all the time and your reflexes are so good! I wanna be just like that!”
The only thing I can say in response is: No. You don’t.
I mean, sure, I have good reflexes and I’m very alert, even when I’m exhausted. I also end up staying up half the night freaking out about a thing I said wrong four (4) years ago. I also have a very, very short attention span. I can bounce from topic to topic to topic to topic in a matter of minutes.
Oh, so I read this cool book last weekend. It was about-
Oops. See? It’s even worse in face-to-face situations.
I talk over people a lot because I’m always afraid I’ll forget what I’m going to say. (Having alters makes it so much harder because someone will front and have no idea what the hell is going on.)
Anyway, that’s just the basics of my anxiety. It’s much more complicated than that, but if I type anymore I will forget what I’m doing.
Toodles!

13,"What does it feel like? I don’t know. I’ve always had it, I think. In elementary school, I had tons of possible escape plans for a variety of scenarios because I was just so terrified that I would be the one caught in a fire, I would be the one kidnapped or stuck alone in the woods or in a car accident or plane crash… It goes on. There is also a lot of social anxiety, and at times I convince myself I am actually schizophrenic or bipolar or GENERALLY DOOMED (dun dun dunnnnnn) and I’m a bit of a hypochondriac (one painful twinge = sh**, I have cancer), and I overthink pretty much everything. One time, a few years ago, I even thought I might be a sociopath. Luckily, I realized that that was far from true (as a note: I rarely act on these thoughts).
I want to walk you through the thought process.
Sooo here’s a very recent diary entry of mine (well, part of it) describing some anxious thoughts that I normally ignore (sorry for the length, feel free to skip it):
“Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, and I think I hear voices whispering at night, just under the fan's white noise, but I can never make out what they're saying. At the same time, I think I'm just stressed and that white noise automatically makes the brain thinks voices are being heard even when they're not. It's just a processing error.
Other times, I think I'm going crazy because I'm pretty sure I see bugs out of the corner of my eye, little flickers in my peripheral, but it could always be my hair or – if I'm wearing my glasses – refraction by the lenses, or it could just be basically anything besides non-existent bugs and I am just being paranoid, as usual.
Sometimes I think I hear someone walking around my house at night and one time I heard my doorknob jiggle just slightly and I went out into the hall to investigate. But again with the white noise. Processing error, crisis mode in the frontal cortex, misinterpretation of the facts, what the f*** ever. Point is, It Is Not Real.
I am just primed for fear, always ready because I'm terrified of dying and I feel close to it since that local kid died.
(it's like sometimes I get close and then I go back to a normal place, a normal distance from the idea of death, and then I think of Elise or something else and I'm back looking into the dark.)
I can die, I can die any moment now and there would just be a black. A darkness. As this one kid said, a kid that I talked to last week, he was all, ""You don't even exist to know you don't exist... I can't imagine it,"" in reference to death and it was like a raw scrape, those words, only I didn't really notice the impact at first – I can't stop thinking about it and I DON'T WANT TO DIE! I don't want that dark.
It's not even dark. There's no color, no shade, no nothing, no nothing to even talk about because all the bright lights, the sparks in your head, the electrical impulses, they stop and so you stop and that's where it ends, that's where You dissipate, everything that was YOU just slows to a stop. The ingredients are still there but it just doesn't function anymore, junked up carnival ride being disassembled for parts.
It's absence versus thin air. It is the lack of something that should be there versus an empty space. Absence versus thin air! Absence versus thin air! Over and over in my head! If I were to go and die, there'd be an absence in a few heads: the heads of my family, my friends, people I knew.
But for me: thin air.
Nothing else! There's nothing else! It's all useless, everything that was you is useless. You get recycled because you're broken, deteriorating, and there's no fixing it!
You're dead! You're dead and those words hold no meaning, nothing has meaning, nothing and I really don't want to ever reach this state, ever exist in a place where I can't freak out about not even existing, can't ever know what happened to the memory of who I was as a person or what even happened to the rest of the human race, how we all died off, what it looked like – felt like – when the Earth was swallowed by the sun.
I feel really close to it.
I know I'm not, but I'm also aware that so much is just out of my control and a jet engine could fall into my room and crush me, or I could get hit by a car or I could slip and hit my head or I could fall down the stairs and break my neck or someone could walk into my house for some fun rape-and-murder or I could be caught in a terrorist attack or a natural disaster or a nuclear explosion or I could get cancer or, god da**, I could have a stroke–”
So many run-on sentences! That is how the thoughts go. I’m lucky I can type so fast.
I guess, in short, I feel like one giant contradiction. Not sure if this is how it is for other people with GAD (maybe this is how everyone feels), but yeah. I’m constantly soothing myself and ramping myself up at the same time. I’m terrified and I’m perfectly calm. I’m irrational and logical. I’m a fire and I stamp myself out, haha.
Again, sorry for the length. Honestly, I am just eager to share my own experience. I don’t really talk about this with actual people and… yeah, I don’t know.
Sometimes I dislike that I feel this way almost all the time, other times I think it’s kind of a gift. I think many people feel that way about their mental illnesses.",GAD
14,"I’ve had severe anxiety since I was in third grade. My anxiety is also accompanied by disassociation, which means I go periods of time where I feel disconnected from reality (often during panic attacks). I would describe my GAD as persistent. It feels like a game of whack-a-mole except instead of endearing/annoying rodents, you’re trying to beat down fears. And the worst part about these fears is that you can often recognise they’re irrational. For instance, I know that being afraid of vomit (one of my triggers) is totally ridiculous, but I can’t control it. It wreaks complete and utter havoc on your life/travel plans when you’re petrified of flying/driving/sailing/riding trains for fear of being ill. And I find I’m afraid of almost everything. Sometimes GAD means you won’t even come into contact with a trigger but will still panic. I often find myself overwhelmed with anxiety sitting down in a comfortable and familiar setting. And panic attacks are terrible. My worst have probably been in cars, because I or whoever’s can’t just pull over now, can I? But I still have the power. I could do it, but at the same time, I can’t. To me, being strong isn’t not having these urges. It’s overcoming these hurdles as best one can. So I continue driving, despite the fact I’m hyperventilating, then crying, then wailing. Of course, I will pull over if my anxiety morphs into disassociation or otherwise prohibits the safety of my driving.
What does it feel like having a panic attack?
Usually my panic attacks start with me being in an unfamiliar situation or position of stress. Sometimes there is a trigger, or something that causes my anxiety. Then, I start getting nauseous and experience acid reflex symptoms, because anxiety impacts your physical health. My breathing feels ineffective, like my chest is a balloon and someone keeps popping it. So I start to take bigger, frenzied breaths. However, this often isn’t a conscious thought process. It will just happen as my mind occupies itself with being useless. I start to tense and feel intensely endangered and fearful. I will start crying lots of the time, and usually wail. Huge siren wails, as if I’m attempting to impersonate a harpooned whale. Generally, this feels terrible. Accompanied with my disassociation, having panic attacks feels like dodging in and out of impending doom.
Having GAD and letting it run rampant is not healthy and can hold you back. Even with GAD that I actively work on controlling, I often am simply incapable of functioning in situations where I’m exposed to triggers. A part of me will always struggle to hold my tipsy friend’s hair back as she is sick, or if I choose to have kids someday, comfort them when they’re ill. I will probably always have fears needing whacking down throughout the day. I’ll need to pull over due to my anxiety at least once more in my lifetime.
Living with GAD has taught me a lot about myself and the people I surround myself with. GAD has desperately tried to sabotage my life, but I have learned to control how I respond to it. I have come to appreciate those moments where I don’t feel burdened. I really truly love my life, even if that includes mental illness.
My Tips for Thriving with GAD:
Understand and accept your weaknesses. Don’t put yourself in situations where you know you’ll be anxious without formulating a plan and support system.
Find a good support system. These are the awesome friends and family members who you can rely on when you need someone to be there for you.
Respect your boundaries. If you don’t feel comfortable talking about GAD with someone and it isn’t totally essential, don’t. Your thoughts and fears are still allowed to be private and entirely your own.
Know when you need to speak up. This rule overrides the aforementioned suggestion. Speaking up might not be particularly comfortable, but if it’s what’s going to allow you to recover (like talking to a therapist or taking a break from a stressful situation), I highly encourage you to go for it.
Distract yourself. Put together a bombass playlist with music that relaxes or consumes your attention. May I recommend Swim by Jack’s Mannequin for this playlist? Download a breathing app or something. Do what you got to do.
Find someone who can help. I’m talking professional help here guys. Therapy is nothing to be ashamed of. I’ve been going since third grade, and, yes, it’s taken a toll on my bank account, but not going takes a toll on my quality of life so…Often if you’re a student, schools offer help.
Establish routines for being in new places and just in general.
Understand that you are not a freak. We often internalise what media and society circulates: that mental illness is something to be ashamed of. Not allowed. Sure, anxiety can be something private, but I refuse to allow you to be ashamed. That’s an order. Love thyself.",GAD
15,"Well, it’s a nighmare when you have a down. You are shaking, can’t sleep or eat. You feel disconnected from the world. GAD is the fear of the unknown, the future ! But … my GAD make me the person I am today ! :) I’m happy even when I’m having bad day sometime. Of course I cry sometime because i’m human and anxiety is hard on me sometime too. I’m studying to be a social worker because I want to help people like me. It’s a long life condition that you have to accept, to embrace. It’s like having diabete, you are not doing to cry everyday because you have diabete ! You go on with your life and learn everything about anxiety. Read book, blog, listen conference.
I’m born this way or maybe I learn it from my father who are anxious all the time when I was a baby ! My dad is a nervous wreck ! I don’t blame anyone for my disorder. The brain is the most complicated organ and I love to understand more about it ! I often thanks my anxiety because she push me to do something that i’m afraid of. I’m finishing my first years of social work bachelor and goddamn I had anxiety many time during this years ! But look where I am now !? I finished my first years ! I’m so proud of myself !
I really thing that mental issues can help you to be more happy than anybody in this world. Why ? Because you know what suffering is ! You know that when you are feeling good, you appreciate every moment of it ! When i’m climbing a mountain, I almost cry because nature is so beautiful from the top ! The diagnosis never define who you are, it’s only pushing you in the right direction when you learn how to live with it !",GAD
16,"Experiences fluctuate with circumstances and self awareness. Shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, lump in the throat, hands go numb, can’t think straight, wanting to run from whatever is causing these highly uncomfortable symptoms. I have gone to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. My body tingles and my skin crawls all at the same time. If I can catch myself at the beginning of feeling anxious I can sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I can talk myself out of having a full blown anxiety attack. It takes practice. Thoughts of worry, doom and gloom, and then a strong feeling that something bad is going to happen can be overwhelming very quickly. I force myself to BREATH; sitting up straight and taking in some slow deep breathes. Then tell myself to STAY IN THE MOMENT and concentrate on what I can do at that very moment. Not what I should or should not have done yesterday nor what I have to do tomorrow. If left to their own demise my thoughts can chase me around in circles until I am exhausted and wishing I could disappear. Anxiety, for me. is a symptom of FEAR and I have too many fears to count. Like I said it takes self awareness and practice as a way to help make anxiety manageable. But to be honest I don’t know if I will ever be at a point in my life where I can be without my anti anxiety medication for those times when I can’t control it on my own.",GAD
17,"I’ll use a scenario that I experienced last year which explains this, at least for me.
A close friend of mine invited me to a video-game lock in at our school, and I’m all hyped for it. The teacher hosting the lock-in got tons of pizza, doughnuts, soda, and all the sweets someone with a sweet-tooth could ask for. I hang out with my friend and tag along with him whenever I can. Feelings of being clingy start rising, but it doesn't change me getting “drunk” from Sprite (aka so hyper that I start acting like I’m drunk even though I don’t drink alcohol.) I’m alert to my surroundings, staying in the sidelines and out of everyone’s way, often keeping a chair available nearby.
A couple hours pass by and I’m watching my friend play Smash Bros with other people. I’m a blanket burrito and keep the blanket tightly wrapped around me, feelings of security finally reaching me. It’s around midnight now, so I decide to do something I’d never do; lay down on the floor, using my arm as a pillow, and rest.
Next thing I know, one of my friend’s other friends stood above me, a huuuuuuuge grin on his face as others gather around and start giggling. I’m half-awake and my brain is scattering for answers of what that familiar marker smell was. The guy held up a mirror and the reflection slapped me awake.
Sharpie. I got Jigglypuffed (my face was drawn on while I passed out, the term is an inside joke to Pokemon).
My whole body flushed and I retreated into my fluffy security blanket, terrified of what was happening. Ashamed that I let myself do such a thing. There was black marks all over my face from the marker, I had no idea I fell asleep. My friend came over and tried his best to get me out of it, but I was already escaping into my own world away from the now loud and blurry party.
Some time later, I finally calm down after going outside and getting some fresh air, but I don’t stop throwing death glares at the guy who drew on my face while I was passed out and vulnerable. My stomach starts doing flips inside me as I catch my breath, feeling the tingling feeling slowly going away from my legs and fingers.
After an hour or so, I regain my composure and return back to the party, still keeping the blanket wrapped around me. I go back to the spot and both my friend and Mr. Evil are playing games. I spend some of the time giving him death glares (which he did comment on and my friend explained that now would not be the best time to talk to me. Wise choice.)
To my surprise, I ended up falling asleep again. Likely from being exhausted from the previous anxiety attack. With my friend being a barrier between me and Mr. Evil, safety slowly got me to sleep a couple more hours. I woke up again and no marker smell. Instead, something much worse.
As soon as I woke up, I jumped up and sprinted across the crowded room and quickly shut the door behind me as I went outside. Even though I don’t remember having a nightmare, my instincts told me that it was not safe in there and I made a grave mistake. I felt nauseous as hell, even though I didn’t eat much. My lungs felt clogged, like there was a boulder on my chest. I can’t breathe. I can’t see well. I cannot cough up what is making me sick. I prayed that no-one saw me or made fun of me behind my back for sitting on the edge of the stairwell in the 50 degree weather with only a blanket to keep her warm. Too many feelings to count swarmed me all at once, mostly rage and shame. To this day, I have no freaking clue why I did that.
The feelings remained for the rest of the lock-in. I stayed outside, unable to go back in without getting an overwhelming force try to push me back outside, back to ‘safety’. Or else something just as bad as the Sharpie incident would happen again.
I ended up having to go home a little early, and my friend helped me over to my mom’s car. I made sure with him that I wasn’t a burden to him or anyone else. I was miserable for weeks after that.
I know it sounds more like social anxiety, but imagine situations like that happening for a wide variety of things, including everyday things like eating and simply moving from Point A to Point B, even within your own home. I’m alert of my surroundings 24/7, very rarely getting a break. The slightest sound can make me jump.
Here’s a few pictures that I often go back to whenever someone asks the same question you have:
And to sum it all up:",GAD
18,"You avoid getting out of your room until the guests leave. And your parents wonder how they brought up such a disrespectful brat.
You are sitting in a crowded room with no one giving a crap about you. But in your head, all you can think of is that the spotlight is on you and you are being judged left and right.
You walk with your head held down. You are too scared to meet the eyes.
Public speaking is scarier than a suicide dive off the Burj Khalifa.
A couple of hours at a party among strangers is more exhausting than a round trip around the earth twice.
If you had to choose between death and approaching your crush, you would voluntarily dig a grave and bury yourself in it.
Your phone is vital. You can pretend to be doing something on it if you happen to be sitting alone in a crowded room.
You are petrified of walking into a room full of people. And if you are made to stand in front of them, your heart forgets it has to pump blood and soon you find yourself losing your balance and in the worst case, falling down unconscious.
You rehearse “hello” with every ring your phone makes while calling someone.
You don’t like people calling you. And you have made the “sorry mate, I was asleep” excuse so many times that a few people think you are in a perpetual state of sleep when you aren’t with them.
You try and pretend to be normal while talking to someone from the opposite sex but one can hear your galloping heartbeats even from Pluto.
Winning a Nobel Prize seems easier than small talks.
98% of people who see you everyday have never heard your voice.
Your dream vacation is the one you spend locked inside your room surfing the internet.
A lot of people unfamiliar with social anxiety might think the above symptoms relate well with “shyness”. Well, they are poles apart. Shyness is a trait, social anxiety is a struggle.
“Shyness” is a part and parcel of a shy person. That is how they are. They accept it and learn to live with it eventually. Some break out of their shells as they grow older. Social Anxiety on the other hand is different. It is not a character trait of a person. It is picked up by the person along the journey of life. A person just can’t decide one morning that he or she wouldn’t be anxious anymore. It just doesn’t work that way. Social Anxiety is a disorder. And it takes a lot away from a person. Other answers on this thread do more justice to the question.
Social Anxiety is different from “introversion”. Introversion is your way while social anxiety gets in your way. You learn to live with introversion at some point of your life, you might even transition to an ambivert or an extrovert, but with social anxiety, you know there is something wrong with you. And unfortunately, the mainstream barely relates with you. It’s worthless sharing your concerns with someone. The most enlightening and frequent advise I ever got from people was “stop caring”. Yeah, as if there is a switch that turns caring off or on.
Never ask a socially anxious person why they are this way. They have been looking for an answer to this question all their lives.
Edit: Due to the amount of attention this answer garnered, I earned a lot of non-Indian followers overtime, some of them indulged in psychiatric study, some of them victims of social anxiety who could relate and some who felt I write on this topic often.
But I would request the readers to not follow me on this answer alone. My answers are strictly India centric, relating more to academic examinations in India, stuff that you will hardly relate to. I appreciate the appreciation. Thank you so much!
It will be four years of me writing this answer in a few months. Things have been better for me. Of course, it is hard to forget how I was robbed off a normal life, about the fun I missed out on, about how I was never the one to approach the friends I have today, all thanks to social anxiety. It illusion-ed me into believing that I was an introvert when I am more of an ambivert. I like being with people, chilling out with them, having fun. I like attention. But thanks to social anxiety, I have always been an outcaste. I am still not comfortable in my own skin. I still carry those deep insecurities 24*7. But guess what, over time it has only gotten better. And if I compare myself to when I had written this, I’d barely be able to recognize myself. Felt like adding this edit for all the depressed, anxious teenagers. There is light at the end of the tunnel. It won’t always be this way. Never be afraid to seek help.",GAD
19,"I had it from 11 y.o. or so. It is a constant gut feeling you get but it is weird. I get excited about certain things or apprehensive about others. There is a subtle difference although hard to pin down. It is not social anxiety as I am extrovert and love people. My parents exacerbated it and my friends calm it down.
Over the years I have found it is always minimized when:
I have a job I like with a good employer. There is a sense of worthwhile goals with some freedom.
My relationships are good, I have several solid friends and we talk. No negative people are in my life.
A good girlfriend who I can talk with.
Some financial security: I fear losing my income a getting into difficulties (not happened yet). I am not quite there yet.
Holidays in the sun, active, new experiences.
I play golf or do something I enjoy, outdoors or a concert. Usually sun and outdoors, warm. Play is important, just as a kid.
Then it fades. It gets worse when these are not present. You could say that I have general insecurity disorder which is alleviated by lifestyle. My childhood was rough and it helped when I avoided my parents, who were not healthy people and painted a dark image of life. I have had some poor employment which was boring for me and I could not see the point of it. I have also worked in places that are unfriendly with lousy management. I have also had some poor partners who were not helpful, lonely periods, job changes and SAD.
I would say it is an ongoing nervous feeling which is up and down, can be intense but low level or absent for periods. Fear of ending in a bad place is there but some of it is linked to not being where I like to be or feel I should be. In general fear rules.
I will say that it went entirely a few times and I felt great. I cannot reproduce that feeling. It was like heaven. Maybe that is what real people experience.
There is chance I have ADHD and anxiety but the former does not fit so well as I have never lost a job through poor work planning etc. I do like well-organised, ethical workplaces and management. I have moved a lot but usually from bad workplaces, as did others so not only me.
It may be that the condition is restlessness and leads to poor or hasty decisions. On the whole a problem that is hard to circumnavigate but lessened by loads of excercise.",GAD
20,"Having GAD is like, feeling restless all the time. Waiting for that one moment , that one person that one medicine which would literally make everything all right.
You know that everything is fine out there but no! You’re mind ain’t got any chills.
The first thought about anything that you get is a strong negative thought.
Anxiety in psychology works kinda like friction in science .Your thought process will always be in a counterattack to what you are supposed to be doing .
My worst thoughts that I have daily are:
As soon as I wake up the first thing that i literally think is why isn’t everything fine yet? Why do I still feel so vague ,so rough about my life ?Will I be able to enjoy and accomplish the day successfully? Will something happen today?
When I am on my way to office in the cab, Am i fine? Is this how my life was supposed to be ? I hope we don’t get into an accident ? i May forget who I am , where I am going ?
When I am working, is this even real ? What’s happening with my life ?why can I feel relaxed ? What if I forget or make any mistake in the work assigned to me?
When someone is talking to me or asking me question, how am i able to understand what he says ? What if I do something wrong ? I become so conscious about my facial expression. I become conscious about myself .
Life changes an der you start hating it. You forget what normal felt like , you start craving to become like you were .
How is possible that a person who was fine just few months back is now so restless.
Example:
You are walking to your house and you will literally feel this.
What if I forget the way?
What if I faint and don’t reach my home ?
What if I suddenly stop walking?
Any possible intrusive thought related to that event will hit you up.
The fact that these thoughts are rubbish is well known by you but the intensity and the power they hold is more strong.
You know you will somehow find a way to skip that thought but how long will you skip such thoughts ?
In My words life as a whole will not matter because you will not have time to think about that, all you will end up realising at the end of day is that more than being in any situation you were in your head.
And believe me you will stat giving self explanatory sentences to yourselfvwd in your head or to others .Because you first fear is ’i hope they don’t think I am crazy’.
You observe things more carefully and you’re mind is literally always analysing .It somewhere sets itself on finding out things that will make you anxious.You know you just need to distract yourself but no matter how much you try it’s an infinite loop.
There is one poisitive things to be noted: Believe me or not you will become more logical with you answers and thinking.
It’a just that’s it’s happening so fast that evrything is just unevenly scattered hence there are thoughts one by one with no relation among them.",GAD
21,"What is generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)?
Everyone gets anxious sometimes, but if your worries and fears are so constant that they interfere with your ability to function and relax, you may have a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a common anxiety disorder that involves constant and chronic worrying, nervousness, and tension. Unlike a phobia, where your fear is connected to a specific thing or situation, the anxiety of GAD is diffused—a general feeling of dread or unease that colors your whole life. This anxiety is less intense than a panic attack, but much longer-lasting, making normal life difficult and relaxation impossible. Generalized anxiety disorder is mentally and physically exhausting. It drains your energy, interferes with sleep, and wears your body out.
If you have GAD you may worry about the same things that other people do, but you take these worries to a new level. A co-worker’s careless comment about the economy becomes a vision of an imminent pink slip; a phone call to a friend that isn’t immediately returned becomes anxiety that the relationship is in trouble. Sometimes just the thought of getting through the day produces anxiety. You go about your activities filled with exaggerated worry and tension, even when there is little or nothing to provoke them.
Whether you realize that your anxiety is more intense than the situation calls for, or believe that your worrying protects you in some way, the end result is the same. You can’t turn off your anxious thoughts. They keep running through your head, on endless repeat. But no matter how overwhelming things seem now, you can break free from chronic worrying, learn to calm your anxious mind, and regain your sense of hope.
The difference between “normal” worry and GAD
Worries, doubts, and fears are a normal part of life. It’s natural to be anxious about an upcoming test or to worry about your finances after being hit by unexpected bills. The difference between “normal” worrying and generalized anxiety disorder is that the worrying involved in GAD is:
excessive
intrusive
persistent
disruptive
Signs and symptoms of GAD
Not everyone with a generalized anxiety disorder has the same symptoms, but most people experience a combination of emotional, behavioral, and physical symptoms that often fluctuate, becoming worse at times of stress.
Emotional Symptoms of GAD include:
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of GAD include:
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of GAD include:
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD

There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD
23,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD

25,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.
Hope I could help!",GAD
26,"Generalised anxiety disorder is not usually taken seriously. However, if one suffers from its symptoms then you take do the following things:
Get enough rest: rest is extremely important to get over anxiety especially if it is stress induced. If you are constantly engaged in hectic work then make sure you get enough rest by getting sleep of 6–7 hours.
Prepare yourself in advance: what I mean by this is that for many people, anxiety is triggered by a certain event or circumstance. If you are able to identify that stimulus or situation which provokes anxiety, then prepare yourself in advance for facing it.
Practise deep breathing : although very common, this technique is actually very helpful to overcome anxiety. It helps to calm the nerves. All you have to do is take a deep breath in and hold it for 5 seconds. Then exhale slowly. Try to hear the sound of your body when you breathe.
Take care of unfinished business: unfinished and incomplete tasks can actually induce anxiety and make problems seem even bigger than they are. Therefore avoid piling up of work. Finish an important task as soon as it arrives. Apply this method especially at your workplace.
Ask yourself- what is the worst that can happen?
This is a practical approach. Whenever you feel anxious due to the occurrence of an event, ask yourself- what is the worst that can happen? Once you have written down the answer, you will feel much better because you have already guessed the possible outcomes. There is no stress related to ambiguity. Next, write down the ways in which you can make things better. Pick the best option and proceed.
Spend time with your pet: spending time with pets has shown to help patients deal with anxiety. Now you need not hug them and cry but spend time with them and take care of them. If you don't have a pet then just help stray animals to get your mind off your troubles.
Show gratitude but don't expect it in return: this may sound idealistic but it is also very practical. Consider your acts of kindness as simple transactions you are the giver and you only are the receiver. What this means is that when doing something helpful, you must find satisfaction in the joy it brings you. You show kindness because it makes you feel better. Do not expect others to reciprocate your generosity. This way, you will not feel bad because you were not expecting anything in the first place and if your behaviour is reciprocated, then it will be a pleasant surprise.",GAD
27,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common anxiety disorder that involves constant and chronic worrying, nervousness, and tension. Unlike a phobia, where your fear is connected to a specific thing or situation, the anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder is diffused—a general feeling of dread or unease that colors your whole life. This anxiety is less intense than a panic attack, but much longer lasting, making normal life difficult and relaxation impossible.
Here are some ways that can help to deal with generalized anxiety disorder-
Connect with others
Talk it out when your worries start spiraling
If you start to feel overwhelmed with anxiety, meet with a trusted family member or friend. Just talking face to face about your worries can make them seem less threatening.
Learn to calm down quickly
Look at anything that relaxes you or makes you smile: a beautiful view, family photos, cat pictures on the Internet.
Listen to soothing music, sing a favorite tune, or play a musical instrument. Or enjoy the relaxing sounds of nature- ocean waves, wind through the trees, birds singing.
Light scented candles. Smell the flowers in a garden. Breathe in the clean, fresh air. Spritz on your favorite perfume.
Slowly eat a favorite treat, savoring each bite. Sip a hot cup of coffee or herbal tea. Chew on a stick of gum. Enjoy a mint or your favorite hard candy.
Give yourself a hand or neck massage. Cuddle with a pet. Wrap yourself in a soft blanket. Sit outside in the cool breeze.
Go for a walk, jump up and down, or gently stretch. Dancing, drumming, and running can be especially effective.
Practical Coping Strategies
Eat Well- Foods do not cause anxiety, but making good food choices can help us keep our mind and body healthy. Eating things like sugary snacks and processed foods can lead to quick highs and lows in our blood sugar that can influence feelings of restlessness and fatigue.
Exercise- Moving your body can be a great way to manage stress. Exercise helps to boost our endorphins and relieve tension.
Get Enough Sleep- According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only 1 in 3 adults in the United States get the recommended seven hours of sleep at night.
Breathing- Shortness of breath can be a common physical symptom of anxiety, along with a tightened chest and muscle tension.
Although the choice is eventually yours, it’s advisable to always talk to a professional before thinking about going the other way.",GAD
28,"Anxiety is a negative, hurried and stressful response to a situation. The mind is not ready to accept any new nerve jangling situation because it is already occupied with multiple negative thoughts running into continous loop.
I would call it a part of obsessive compulsive disorder. For instance, you were in love with a really cute, humble girl. she was more than life. Those late night talks, date inside church, lovely gifts, standing with you during the thick and thins of life.
Always motivating you to excel and extremely supportive with your family. If there is a heaven on earth, its here. She is more than nymph. You love her forever even beyond death and all of sudden, she decides to break up with you.
Your relationship has reached the saturation point and collapsed. Your life support system is no more with you. You would cry even being a man and beg her to come back in life. suddendly heaven becomes graveyard.
Whole day and night you are constantly thinking about her, same thought with various permutation and combination. What, if, when , then, else, you are running your own emotional flowchart. And your family tell you to focus on career and help them financially.
A simple thought will give your severe panic, anxiety and tension. I am alone , shattered with broken relationship and now how will I help my parents in livelihood. I am in no frame of mind. Hope you are getting the point.
Anxiety is nothing, but over occupied mind with thoughts sucking all your energy reservoirs. Realization is the key. NLP (Neuro Linguistic Program) has been instrumental in resolving teh stress, anxiety and depression.
A friend of mine tried for few months and he came out completely new. Acceptance is the only answer, once you accept the good and bad part of life and let it go and focus on other aspects, life willbe easy. Create, operate and destroy is the universal law of nature. There is nothing good or bad, someone can be important, but not all the time.
Simple theory is whatver happened, happened for the good. Attachment with entity is the main reason behind our sorrow. So let it go.",GAD
29,"Here are a few things that have helped me:
No marijuana or any other psychoactive substance.
Minimize caffeine intake. This one is tough because caffeine does help me focus, so I keep it to a minimum and follow it up with water, which leads to
Stay hydrated.
Choose food wisely. Eat small meals at a time. Chew each at least some bites mindfully, and thoroughly, thinking about where that food came.
Go for walks, in nature, and don’t bring my phone. I have a watch for the time.
There are other things I do to take care of my physical being, like meditation and stretching, that when they are part of my daily rituals, I do even better.
tl;dr (for the rest of this): I monitor my thoughts, and choose to discontinue thoughts I deem unhelpful or contrary to my values.
Treating my physical body with love and respect is important and helpful, but the cognitive work I have done has provided the most relief. I spent many years thinking that external circumstances caused my anxiety. I did my best to avoid any situation that I deemed stressful. I rarely went to restaurants, concerts, or generally any social setting where I had to interact and negotiate with anybody, or where there were too many rules. As I got older, I got better at managing life (due greatly to the influence of my first wife), and I began to slowly recognize that I was feeling anxious even when my circumstances weren’t particularly stressful. Then one day, I had a particularly catalyzing event that made this truth undeniable, that my anxiety might be triggered by some external event, but the actual experience was some sort of chemical imbalance within me.
I was going to a festival with my daughter to deliver some supplies to a friend, and in exchange I would get in for free. The whole trip, everything was going perfectly. We were perhaps going to be 10 to 15 minutes later than I said, but the supplies weren’t need until later anyways. Traffic was perfect. We hadn’t forgotten anything. We had enough money to be comfortable. On the drive I began feeling intensely anxious. I kept looking for reasons why. Parking was going to be horrible because we were getting there late. At the time we were arriving, we’d probably have a 15 minute walk from the car in the heat. But we could drop the supplies at the gate no problem, then park. Did I remember what to bring? Yes I had everything. As we passed the volunteer parking lot right next to the entrance, the person at the gate recognized my daughter, called out her name, and waved us into a parking spot. We had gate side parking, in the shade, free passes, plenty of money, time with my daughter, friends, great music, a place to camp, all at one of my favorite festivals (because it’s small but exciting). I couldn’t find a single external reason to blame for feeling anxious. I had to accept that my anxiety is a state of being not dependent on circumstances. I had to accept that there is something wrong with me. That acceptance has made it much easier to make progress. Life is just life. I’m the one freaking out. This set the stage for the next step in reducing the impact of anxiety attacks on my life.
When I had to accept that external events were not causing my anxiety, and in fact were triggering them less and less as I got older and gained experience, I became more willing and able to examine my thought patterns. I love to let my mind wander. I love to fantasize. I write songs and stories and skits, and the wandering mind is a part of my creative process. One day, in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, I was driving along, fantasizing about how I could blow up the Goldman Sachs building. I was dreaming up ways of I could make it happen and maybe even get away with it. I noticed what I was thinking, and another part of myself asked out loud, do I really want to be thinking about that? It goes so completely contrary to my core values. I’m a pacifist. I don’t want to hurt anybody, even if they theoretically deserve it, which they almost never do. Why am I thinking about this? I could have made up the excuse that I was just fantasizing a plot line for yet another story I won’t write. What I really was doing was feeling powerless about the international financial crisis, and the fantasizing was a coping mechanism. I was also aware of how anxious I was feeling. The anxiety was causing me to latch on to the crisis as an excuse for what I was experiencing. I was driving too fast. I was twitchy and sketchy, fast breathing, things I experience when I’m anxious. The crisis wasn’t affecting me. I’m poor. I have no investments. I live in a poor county. I was almost completely unaffected by the financial crisis. Nothing much in my life changed. I was looking for an excuse as to why I was anxious, and the thoughts were adding to my anxiety, in a feedback loop.
So I started thinking about positive things, things were going good in my life, things I could do something about, and lo and behold, my anxiety lessened. It didn’t go away completely, it just had less influence over me. So that day, I made an agreement with myself. I’m going to start monitoring my own thoughts, and regularly ask myself, do I really want to be thinking about this? If the answer was yes, then think away. But if the answer was no, then think about something else. Typically, I would sing a song in my mind as a transition, then turn my thoughts towards something positive. It took me a couple of years to get good at it.
I still have panic attacks. I still am reluctant to put myself into certain situations even though it would benefit me. I avoid tasks that can trigger my anxiety, because it sucks. It feels awful. I hate it. But when it does happen, I know that it is a chemical, or perhaps electrical, imbalance within me. It’s as if I’m on a drug, and I will come down. I just have to ride it out, and meanwhile, think about things I like to think about. Think about things I have control over. I almost never take meds anymore. Only when it’s really bad and I have to function.",GAD

31,"Personally, I have taken a very long route in using mindfulness and a little bit of CBT and noticing my black-and-white thinking or catastrophize Ing and my discomfort with uncertainty or anything being attached to “what if’s” and the future.
I feel like that small summary and calculates a lot of it, but mindfulness is an ongoing journey and meditation. The formal practice is very hard at first, but if you start really really small and time yourself and maybe combine it with some body movement stretching on the floor and a special place that you put a side for your practice. Eventually, it will become a game changer. But that also involves acceptance acceptance is really key here and I mean and not just an ordinary way, but sometimes you’ve got a dig really deep for the most profound acceptance you can because if you consider all of the outcomes.. if your stomach or your nerves Start getting the best of you, I would recommend to consider “what is the very worst thing that can happen right now”? And then adding on “ What is the likelihood that that will happen statistically proportionally?”. But ladder is less important because no matter how bad it is or even if it is a likelihood, the important thing is that you learn to accept yourself in all of those scenarios and your imperfectly perfectness And perfectly imperfectness. I find that a lot of people who suffer with generalized anxiety also overlap with some people who have CPTSD. And so if this is not happening, I would also be open to considering that. I just had this because I find that a lot of people are practising too many things and so not specializing and considering the other possibilities.
also, if you have insomnia as a side effect, I highly recommend using acceptance with this as well, and if it’s about creating a good relationship between you and your bed. Doing specific hygiene every day if you have generalized anxiety disorder, you might be also to a highly sensitive person and HSP. And so given these conditions, you have a nervous system that is aroused with more stimuli and, absorbs stimuli differently than 80% of the population. A traumatized system is going to do the same and spoil spiral out and upwards in a way that is very unpleasant. For example, some people when they get tired of getting sleepy, they become more wired and distressed. I went through that for a very long time and the only way out is acceptance in my experience and from what I have heard from others.",GAD
32,"Counseling and therapy. I think this is the best way to really learn to manage GAD
Avoid caffeine! Avoid stimulants and high sugar foods.
Exercise.
Journal about why your anxious when your anxiety is bad. -This will allow you to release and work through some of the anxiety as well as keep a catalog of times and things that make you anxious which can be helpful when trying to find coping mechanisms or trying to identify your triggers.
Learn breathing techniques that work for you.
Find a support group.
Eat a healthy diet.
Maybe try some natural supplements like fish oil.
Don't be to hard on yourself, understand that you have GAD and it's not easy and it will be okay.
Practice positive talk. If you're anxiety makes you think ""I'm going to fail” or “""what if this happens” Always try to counter that with a positive thought like, “""what if I do good” or “""what if I have a lot of fun”
You can try scents. Like calming aromas lavender. Or stronger scents like peppermint to help jolt your brain out of an anxiety loop. Biting into a lemon or jalapeno can also help get your brain back on track.
Do some research on what GAD is and what is happening in your body. Understanding it will help you feel more in control and just give you some ease about what you're going through.
A good therapist will help you understand what your body is doing when you have GAD. They will help you identify things that trigger your anxiety and help you find ways to cope with anxiety. It takes time and work, but if you really try, you can really manage your anxiety better. It's not an overnight thing, but the sooner you start, the sooner you start improving and then the sooner you'll have days where you'll realize you didn't have anxiety when you normally would or that your anxiety wasn't as bad as usual and those are great feelings.

Exercise? Yeah, it's a game-changer. Nothing like a good sweat sesh to kick those anxious vibes to the curb. And let's not forget about the simple stuff, like getting enough shut-eye and eating decent grub. Your body and mind need fuel to fight the anxiety monster, so don't skimp on the basics.
Oh, and don't even get me started on the power of hobbies. Whether it's strumming a guitar or painting a masterpiece, finding something you love can do wonders for your mental health.

I can empathize with what you have been experiencing. I would suggest first making an appointment with a Clinical Psychologist. With that aside, there are both medicinal approaches and non-medicinal ones (I am rather biased toward the latter approach).
As for the various therapies, it all depends on what works best for *you*. The thing is, never give up trying if one approach doesn’t work. You could consider the following:
Talk therapy - with a trained Psychologist
CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) - with a trained Psychologist
Meditation - includes Mindfulness and/or Vipassana meditation
Pranayama, which would go well with meditation and yoga.
Various types of Yoga which would require a proper instructor. Having attended ISHA’s “Inner Engineering” program, I can recommend it (the only issue here is that it requires a commitment of 40 days of doing the Yoga Kriya twice a day - takes about 45 minutes).
As for medicinal approaches, there are many. I am not a fan of any of them (unless your anxiety is severe enough that it prevents you from functioning normally). Usually the anxiety medications come with a host of side-effects and the efficacy of the different classes of drugs are highly individualized. Jeff Hammerbacher has covered the medicinal categories well enough and I don’t want to regurgitate it :)
I would recommend starting off with Talk therapy with a Psychologist before trying the other approaches, for one major reason: It may bring you closer to the root of your anxiety and help you identify what the source of your worries are. From there, you can work on dealing with the triggers that lead to this anxiety.
Wishing you all the best :)",GAD
35,"It is absolutely possible to cure anxiety. What worked for me was learning Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) and Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). There are other methods like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), PSTEC (Percussive Suggestion Technique) and more.
What it boils down to is finding out what’s underlying your anxiety, which is usually beliefs you’ve formed early in life, and changing it.
So, ask yourself, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?” What do you have to believe about yourself, other people, interacting with other people, the world, and life in general, in order to feel anxious?
Write down everything that comes to mind. Do this exercise for a couple of days because you might get new answers on different days. Keep doing this until you can’t come up with any new responses to the question.
I usually recommend starting with EFT because it’s pretty simple to learn and the emotional change is fast and profound. Emotional Freedom Technique is a natural method of neutralizing negative emotions and thought patterns by using acupressure and talking through (basically venting) what is upsetting you.
Go on Youtube and look up EFT for beginners and look for the video by Jessica Ortner. EFT is going to look strange. It involves tapping certain places on your face (acupressure points) multiple times and saying things related to the issue. Just give it a try. If you want, you can also look up EFT for anxiety and follow along with some videos.
After you learn the EFT process (it’s not hard), apply it to everything you wrote down when you asked, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?”
Also, you can use it whenever you’re feeling anxious, upset or any other negative feeling like angry, sad or anything else.
Something most people have an issue with when they are new to EFT is not knowing what to say when they tap. The best way I’ve found to get around that is to imagine you’re talking to a close friend about whatever is bothering you and just vent as you tap. Get all of your thoughts and feelings out about the situation as you tap through each of the points. You will find that this works very well.
If you’re interested, I would be happy to work with you on your anxiety. I’ve helped a lot of people overcome their challenges. Just let me know!",GAD
36,"When anxious, you believe that something near you or in front of you has the power to destroy your life, which triggers a fight or flight response inside your body.
For example, people with social anxiety assume other people as a threat to their respect or existence.
A matter of danger.
‘The interaction would only bring negativity to me.’
Be it people, dark, exams, interviews, phone calls, doorbells, animals, heights etc you perceive it as an immediate threat.
You need to correct yourself with firmness and intensity-
“No, this can't destroy me. It doesn't have the power to destroy me, it's not so important, it's perceived by me as a threat and not a real threat.”
The foremost rule is to be able to handle negative outcomes, losses and wounds. The self-belief to overcome any loss, the perceived strength to be able to deal with the odds of life.
‘Okay, if something goes wrong, I will handle it.’
‘I have the required abilities to handle mishappenings.’
‘I don't care, I know I can deal with life.’
Understand that your perception is biased and influenced by notions, limited experiences, overthinking and overestimating.
A lizard peacefully spotting insects on a wall won't swallow you.
A person can reject you or your words, they can't destroy you, their rejection can’t destroy you, there would surely be a way out, you will surely meet more people, get fresh opportunities.
Be relived by the thought-
‘What will be will be.'
‘What has to happen will happen.’
‘Destiny shall unfold itself.’
‘Every action, event or situation is a way to take me to my destiny, be it negative, positive or neutral.’
‘If I lose something today, it's a step toward finding something new.’
Silent your mind for a few seconds by taking a deep controlled breath and focussing on your relevant action at the moment. “I need to do this and I shall do it well. That's it, that's all I can do.”
Close your eyes and think about what's good in life, realise that life is good, and realise that you are powerful and capable.
Always have an overall vision towards life, how you want to live your life overall, as a doer, as a strong personality, as a hero of your life, as someone who never stops, who faces every storm head-on.
Focus on learning through each event, especially the bitter ones, they teach you a lot for the future, a person rejecting or mistreating you would tell you a lot about psychology, your mistakes, and their attitude.
If you focus on learning, you observe each event from the sky, as a third person, without being directly involved with it. It reduces anxiousness.
Note down all positive interactions with that stimulus or matter: your and other people’s. This will help in correcting the flaws in your thoughts.
Celebrate the smallest of achievements of overcoming your fear, any positive interaction, any non-negative interaction, or any strong fight you gave to that event. Uplift yourself.

37,"Before one attempts to deal with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)[1], it is important to understand what it’s all about. GAD is a common anxiety disorder that involves chronic worrying, nervousness and tension. The feelings are less severe than in a panic attack but more lasting. This results in making normal life difficult and relaxation impossible.
The best thing to do when one experiences symptoms similar to GAD is to consult a mental health care professional who can assess the symptoms and recommend the necessary course of therapy and/ or medication. Early medical intervention can help cure this disorder and will also help confirm whether one even has this illness or not.
Along with this, one can also try the following:
Think about what stresses you and seek to minimize it or keep away from the negative triggers.
Stay connected with supportive friends or family members.
Don’t sit idle. Engage in interesting activities throughout the day to avoid overthinking. Stay busy.
Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises.
Sleep for at least seven to nine hours with minimum environmental or technology intervention.
Limit caffeine, alcohol, soda and nicotine.
Do not believe that worry or thinking too much can abstain one from making mistakes.
Remember, a stitch in time saves nine! So, take the first step and keep going till you become better than what you were yesterday. With an unwavering determination, one can easily fight anxiety issues and can lead normal and productive lives.

Hello
If you are diagnosed for GAD or generalised anxiety disorder, this diagnosis must have been done by a mental health professional, like a Psychiatrist or a Psychotherapist. Both these professionals can treat GAD.
I suffered from depression with anxiety and I am taking treatment from a Psychiatrist. For the last 11 years I am stable, but I have to take prescribed medications everyday, for lifetime.
I suggest you try CBT or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, the clinically proven drug-free treatment for depression and anxiety. For this you have to consult a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist for taking CBT talk therapy sessions, one every week, till advised. This talk therapy can also be done via videoconferencing apps ZOOM, Skype, Google Meet, etc.
For more information on CBT you can watch videos of Dr David D Burns, M.D. on YouTube, where he talks about what is CBT and the need of developing CBT and how this treatment is better then medicines. You can also buy his book “Feeling Good-The New Mood Therapy” which is a self-help book, in which techniques of CBT are given, to be done at home by readers to alleviate anxiety.
All the best.",GAD
40,"Whether it's generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, or just nerves, here are some techniques that will help you get it under control.
Rhythmic breathing. Breathe through your nose using your abdomen and count four in, hold four, four out. .
Visualization. Picture your neck relaxing, your forehead relaxing, your scalp relaxing and finally your eyes relaxing. As you do this your whole body melts away.
Affirmations. While doing these exercises say to yourself, ""I am calm and confident."" Repeatedly day this as you drift off to sleep. Use this trigger anytime you feel anxious.
Practice meditation. (It's very simple. Google for a method you like and practice. Many communities and colleges have groups who meet to practice.
Yoga. Pick a few poses that give you a good overall stretch. Nothing feels better than a well-led meditation after the gentle exertion of a yoga session.
Exercise. Daily exercise will not only relieve anxiety and restore self confidence, but it improves mood.
For any of these to work, practice religiously for three weeks and by then ethey will begin to become habits. with
To be effective, they need to be reflexive. At least the body response does. To facilitate that, associate a trigger with the relaxed state you hope to achieve.
A trigger is anything you can easily attach to the body state you are seeking. I find tactile and auditory work best for me.
Tactile can be as simple as touching thumb e rrlaced dtste.nand forefinger with the intention of stress draining out of your body. Use the techniques suggested above until the end state becomes familitar enough for you to drop immediately into the desired state.",GAD
41,"As a psychologist, I recommend a multifaceted approach to managing generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Therapy, particularly cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), is foundational for addressing the underlying thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety. Medication, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, can be helpful for many individuals in reducing symptoms. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, adequate sleep, and a balanced diet play a crucial role in managing anxiety. Mindfulness techniques, stress management strategies, and building a strong support network further complement treatment. It's essential to tailor interventions to each individual's needs and preferences, emphasizing a holistic approach that addresses psychological, biological, and social factors contributing to GAD. Regular monitoring and adjustment of treatment plans in collaboration with a mental health professional are key to long-term success in managing generalized anxiety disorder.",GAD

44,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

When people say anxiety is uncontrolled worry, it’s not like you are consciously realizing something as stressful and so you are worried about it. It’s not like “Oh, I’m worried I did that wrong” it doesn’t come from rational thought. GAD for me is just sort of there like a layer on top of my personality. So I am me and can act accordingly but in the background everything is stressing me out. Sometimes it’s less sometimes it more. Occassionally for whatever reason I have a day where the background stress is overwhelming and I can’t overcome it. These are days I usually have to call out of work. I mean every morning is a struggle, but some days it’s not a struggle I can win. As for how it feels physically, you know that feeling you get when you suddenly hear something really bad. Where it feels like your soul just drops out of your body and you don’t quite know how to comprehend what you’ve just heard. Thats what GAD feels like for me, in the background of my mind all day everyday, like someone is telling me really bad news constantly. Thats on medication. Without medication I have many days where I do not function. I developed GAD after as a result of my brother passing away. Prior to that I was a strong minded, confident, assertive man. I don’t know what I am anymore.",GAD
54,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible.

What is generalized anxiety disorder?
Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Many people may worry about things such as health, money, or family problems. But people with GAD feel extremely worried or nervous more frequently about these and other things—even when there is little or no reason to worry about them. GAD usually involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread that interferes with how you live your life. It is not the same as occasionally worrying about things or experiencing anxiety due to stressful life events. People living with GAD experience frequent anxiety for months, if not years.
GAD develops slowly. It often starts around age 30, although it can occur in childhood. The disorder is more common in women than in men.
What are the signs and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder?
People with GAD may:
Worry excessively about everyday things
Have trouble controlling their worries or feelings of nervousness
Know that they worry much more than they should
Feel restless and have trouble relaxing
Have a hard time concentrating
Startle easily
Have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep
Tire easily or feel tired all the time
Have headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains
Have a hard time swallowing
Tremble or twitch
Feel irritable or ""on edge""
Sweat a lot, feel lightheaded, or feel out of breath
Have to go to the bathroom frequently
Children and teens with GAD often worry excessively about:
Their performance in activities such as school or sports
Catastrophes, such as earthquakes or war
The health of others, such as family members
Adults with GAD are often highly nervous about everyday circumstances, such as:
Job security or performance
Health
Finances
The health and well-being of their children or other family members
Being late
Completing household chores and other responsibilities
Both children and adults with GAD may experience physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath that make it hard to function and that interfere with daily life.
Symptoms may fluctuate over time and are often worse during times of stress—for example—with a physical illness, during school exams, or during a family or relationship conflict.
What causes generalized anxiety disorder?
Risk for GAD can run in families. Several parts of the brain and biological processes play a key role in fear and anxiety. By learning more about how the brain and body function in people with anxiety disorders, researchers may be able to develop better treatments. Researchers have also found that external causes, such as experiencing a traumatic event or being in a stressful environment, may put you at higher risk for developing GAD.

60,"Hi, thank you for writing to us.
GAD can be very troublesome to live with. GAD causes you to worry about situations endlessly and uncontrollably. Chronic Anxiety Neurosis can be another name for it. The person with GAD has no control over his/her anxiousness. They constantly worry and fear about situations that are not that huge and sometimes even about things in future. They seem to express a feeling of helplessness and inability to calm themselves. It is very different from regular anxiety, which goes away after some time. This is much more serious than that and can cause several problems in daily life.
Symptoms- The commonly observed symptoms of people with Generalized anxiety disorder is irritability, fatigue, difficulty in sleeping and sometimes insomnia. Another common symptom is difficulty in concentrating because anxiety and constant worry doesn't leave you alone. Anything you do, there is a continuous tension building up in the thought process. Repeated stomach aches and diarrhoea is also experienced. Increasing heart rates, muscle tension, sweaty palms, shaking, numbness in some body parts are also the symptoms to keep in mind.
Causes- There can be several reasons why a person develops GAD, and having it transferred through genes is one of them. Childhood trauma is a reason for developing it. Also, the most common reason is the environment. If you are in a stressful environment for a long time, such as in a workspace or have illness issues, then you are likely to develop it. Excessive use of tobacco and caffeine will make anxiety more serious.
It can be treated through cognitive Behavioural therapy and medications.
I hope this helped.

61,"Anxiety is a natural body reaction as a protection us from danger.
GAD is when that stress reaction gets turned on and stays on chronically, rather than the usual stress reaction of see a bear, run away, get to safety, relax.
In today's world we face fewer bears, and more chronic stressors such as work, relationships, finances etc. leading to more chronic activation rather than the typical brief activation this system was designed for.",GAD
62,"That’s a broad question.
Anxiety ranges in intensity from a stressed-out overwhelmed feeling to a full-blown panic attack that sends you to the emergency room for a heart check.
Different types of anxiety include
generalized anxiety (GAD),
panic,
social anxiety,
phobias such as fear of flying,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Anxiety is both emotional and physical.
You feel the emotion of anxiety and you feel the physical sensation of being anxious.
Your body and mind are connected, and each affects the other: your biochemistry can alter your mood and your mood can alter your biochemistry.
Anxiety is heightened fear. When fear provokes the fight, flight, or freeze response, it commands your body to perform specific chemical processes that are meant to keep you safe in times of danger. Some of the resulting physical changes are felt as the symptoms of anxiety.
Anxiety’s physical manifestations are different for different people. One person might sweat, another person might have diarrhea, another constipation. Your particular body and the intensity of your anxiety will determine your symptoms.
For more on the emotional and physical symptoms of anxiety, and anxiety books and other resources, check out this post:
What are Anxiety Symptoms?
We feel anxiety emotionally and we feel anxiety physically. Anxiety symptoms can be both emotional and physical. It can drive you to act in a demanding or irrational way as you attempt to get relief from the fear. Or it can narrow your world as you reduce your exposure to situations that stimulate the fear.

63,"Here’s an average school day:
A.L = Anxiety Level, 0% being completely calm and 100% being anxiety attack.
6:45 AM - Wake up and hope that my legs aren't paralyzed from social anxiety. If so, I have to wait two to three hours for it to go away. [A.L: 30% normally, 50% if woke up from nightmare]
7:00 AM - Try to block out my mother’s and sister’s arguing to hurry up when both of them are on their computers/tablets, or when my sister refuses to get up and my mom has to get her dressed. Music with noise-canceling headphones usually do the trick.
7:30 AM - After telling me when she gets home later that afternoon and checking to see if my legs are paralyzed, mom takes my sister to school, I stay on the sofa listening to music.
10:40 AM - Nine times out of ten, my legs heal and I’m able to slowly walk around the house. I get dressed, wash up, and get out the door with my messenger bag by 10:45.
10:50 AM - Deep breaths as I walk the half mile to school, listening to music as I go down the sidewalk. Because my brain didn’t remind me about the medicine (sometimes even if I get a miracle and remember), every time a car passes by, one or more of the following thoughts goes through my head:
“Pedophile.”
“If the car pulls up beside you, run.”
“Please don’t get near me.”
“Don’t be a crazy person and try to run me over.” (Even though I’m on the sidewalk.)
“Just keep walking.”
11:00 AM - If I left correctly and paced myself correctly, I arrive at a ten-foot-long crosswalk that is at the entrance to the student parking lot. My school, like any high school, has a lot of rude teens. I stop at the crosswalk, look both ways and down the road to check for cars, and speed-walk to the other side while holding my breath as if I was trying to commit a crime. [
[Off chance I get there at 11:02 - Cars fill the entrance as each driver tries to get onto the main road. I can feel their judging eyes on me as I approach the crosswalk. I could feel their annoyances as they only want to go to lunch and don’t want to wait a second longer because some crazy walker girl decides to come to school at this exact time. I make my first step, making eye contact with the driver as my pace speeds up and I run to the other side. Although, if I wait long enough, someone else could be on the other side of the crosswalk. The pure blessed coincidence lets me know that it’s safe to cross without getting yelled at, as I’m not the only one crossing. I make it to the other side and take a deep breath. I survived.]
11:05 - I meet up with a couple friends and we chat and play around during lunch hour. It often starts with me going up to our second-floor meeting spot and me apologizing for being out of breath and tired. They both nod and say it’s okay, as both of them know about my anxiety. It’s only during this time when my defenses are lowered. [A.L: 20%, 40–70% if trigger passes by.]
12:03 - Bell rings, I say goodbye and go to my first class (everyone else’s fifth class). I happen to have something called “Office Aide”, where I get to help out the administrators in the discipline office. For me, it’s a social exercise. Whenever I’m not called to do something, I hang out in the staff lounge and listen to music (bonus points if I’m the only one there, excluding the occasional admin or two). Occasionally I get to deliver papers from one office to another, or manage the printer for a teacher who needs copies.
However, there is one activity that is the most common, and by far what I hate the most: Pass delivery. Which requires organizing the passes from nearest to farthest away, mentally highlighting the fifth period classes for each student, and checking every ten seconds to make sure they are in correct order and I didn't make any mistake. Then it’s opening the door and having 20–23 pairs of eyes following my every step and action, while I have to keep my eyes on the teacher, who I just interrupted their lesson with something from the office. As soon as I give the teacher the pass(es) and explain what they’re for in short sentences, I do a 180 u-turn and bolt right through the door. Once I get through, I take a breather and go on to the next classroom. Repeat as needed.
The next couple classes are easier. The teachers know I have GAD and give me permission to listen to concentration music to block out all the other background noises from other classmates.
After school, I meet up with my friends again, chat, and then head home. Repeat 11:02 behavior except everyone wants to go home and are even more reckless. Honking makes me jump and bolt to the other side, only crossing the crosswalk when others are crossing at the same time as me.
Same paranoia with walking home as in the morning.
3:00 PM - I unlock the house door and collapse on the sofa after taking off my bag and changing out of my collared-shirt uniform to something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m being lightly choked. Start slow work on writing and homework, as well as completing all necessary assignments for online classes-
5:00 PM - A weird taste gets in my mouth as I wake up from accidentally passing out and having no memory how I got to the sofa or how I managed to fall asleep. Realize the time and panic for a little that I only have 30 minutes before mom and sister come home.
5:30 PM - Chaos ensues. Katie starts shouting and pulling my very-tired mother to go play with her on Minecraft or Roblox, not caring that she’s been working a min-paying job for seven hours. I have no-where to go to escape. My mom retreats to her room to nap, while my sister puts on her earphones and shouts for mom to go to her. I end up being the middle-man and play messenger until I remind mom that she’s a mother. I put on my headphones and lower my 70% anxiety with more music and watching videos.
This continues until my grandmother likely comes over and I have to hide, least a panic attack would be triggered and I’d be punished by her for not fully calming down in 15 minutes and that I’m “crazy”. (She’s no help is my point.)
10:00 PM - House is blissful. Mom and sister are asleep, I’m on the sofa again either typing stories, reading and answering Quora questions/articles, playing Sims 4, or researching psychology.
4:00 AM - Insomnia holds me hostage. I have stared at the ceiling for hours. Every little sound I hear wakes me up like a monster is trying to get into the house. I have a light on in the living room to keep me out of the dark and so I have full sight of my immediate surroundings. AC unit kicks in every once in a while, my mind often mistaking it as some madman trying to invade the house by going through the vents, same with creaking of the door or leaves bouncing along the ground outside by the wind.
This repeats every day. It changes very little during weekends and school breaks; Everything around me is terrifying, leaves scare me, people remind me that I don’t belong in this world, and my family is just another obstacle for me to overcome along with my anxiety. I write a lot as a result; writing is my escape path. I wish I can write more, but I don’t want to annoy you with long things to read. ^_^
That’s my daily life with anxiety. I have my good and bad days, and every day is very draining. My family tell me to be more social, that I should be this or that like what other teenage girls do. I ignore all that crap and focus on taking care of myself and know where my limits lie. I have GAD because of my surroundings, but now I try not to let my surroundings summon what it created.

Genetics: People with a family history of anxiety disorders are more likely to develop GAD.
2. Brain chemistry: Imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, may contribute to the development of GAD.
3. Environmental factors: Traumatic events, chronic stress, and significant life changes can trigger or worsen GAD.
4. Personality traits: People who are naturally more anxious, perfectionistic, or have a tendency to worry may be more prone to developing GAD.
5. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders, heart disease, and chronic pain, may increase the risk of developing GAD.
6. Substance abuse: Alcohol and drug use can contribute to the development of GAD.
7. Childhood experiences: Traumatic experiences in childhood, such as abuse or neglect, can increase the risk of developing GAD later in life.
It is important to note that not everyone who experiences these factors will develop GAD, and not everyone with GAD will have experienced these factors. GAD is a complex disorder and each person’s experience may be different.

Condition Generalized Anxiety Disorder (gad)
There are a variety of treatments available for controlling anxiety, including several effective anti-anxiety medications and specific forms of psychotherapy. In terms of medications, buspirone (Buspar) is known to be quite effective for treating GAD. However, it seems to be less effective in managing many other disorders that often co-occur (are comorbid) with GAD. Therefore, specific members of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) classes of drugs, which are also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for effective treatment of GAD, are prescribed more often. Examples of SSRI medications include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro). Examples of SNRI medications are duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq). Although buproprion (Wellbutrin) is known primarily as an antidepressant, preliminary research suggests that it may also be helpful in the treatment of anxiety. Benzodiazepine medications like clonazepam (Klonopin) and lorazepam (Ativan) are sedatives and are therefore more useful in stopping severe anxiety symptoms, like those that occur in panic disorder or in posttraumatic stress disorder, rather than the ongoing worry that is usually associated with GAD. Although alprazolam (Xanax) is often used to treat panic attacks, its short duration of action can sometimes result in having to take it several times per day. Another benzodiazepine, diazepam (Valium), tends to be used less often due to concerns about its length of action and addiction potential. Medications from the beta-blocker family (for example, propranolol [Inderal]) are sometimes used to provide rapid relief of the physical symptoms associated with a panic attack. Some individuals who suffer from severe panic attacks may benefit from treatment with neurontin (Gabapentin), which was initially developed to treat seizures, or may benefit from a neuroleptic medication like risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), or lurasidone (Latuda). Zolpidem (Ambien) has been found helpful in treating the insomnia that can often be a symptom of anxiety. Before SSRIs and SSNRIs became available, medications from the group known as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were often used to address panic disorder. Although TCAs have been found to be equally effective in treating panic attacks, SSRIs and SSNRIs have been proven to be safer and better tolerated. Therefore TCAs are used much less often than they used to be. When used in the appropriate person with close monitoring, these medications can be quite effective as part of treatment for panic disorder. For individuals who may be wondering how to avoid panic attacks using treatment without prescribed medications, natural remedies may be an option. While treatment like hypnosis and herbal

80,"Being stressed or anxious about one's future is not unhealthy, or pathological. As a matter of fact, it’s the opposite as everyone feels some level of anxiety in certain situations (before an exam, during a first date, getting up to give a speach, learning something new, etc.). Normal levels of stress and anxiety keeps us on our toes, sharp, alert, and ready for whatever comes our way next. Even excess levels of stress is not so bad, if it's intermittent. This usually happens when inconvenient, and unexpected occurrences pop up, or we're trying to multi task. This person will usually feel better after going for a walk or practicing some deep breathing exercises.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder, as well as other anxiety disorders, become a major problem when they greatly impair your ability to carry out daily tasks and be a functional member of society. This is why they call it a disorder. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD, is the person who is so preoccupied with anything and everything which needs to get done, that abnormally high levels of anxiety and stress build to the point where he/she gets nothing done. They cannot “take one step at a time,” and well meant planning and structured thought patterns become disorganized and thrown into chaos because they can't control the anxiety. So where as before, anxiety was our friend, now with GAD, anxiety has become the enemy. It's like having a little fire under control, you can use it too your benefit by keeping warm or cooking meals. However, when the fire grows out of control, and is a cause for destruction, now you need to go get help. Look at your anxiety as a thermostat, something that is not controlling you, you are able to control it. That's the difference between having anxiety, and having an anxiety disorder. GAD is also not at all good, because having it, often leads to alcohol and/or substance abuse.

Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.

95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
89,"Thanks for the A2A.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD
90,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
91,"Your heart races. Your body temperature rises. Your hands may shake. Your stomach may churn.
Your thoughts start spiraling to the worst could that happen, and suddenly you feel so unequipped—like everything’s going to fall apart, and you won’t be able to handle it.
It can feel so powerless when anxiety takes over, almost like your brain and body are being hijacked, and there’s little you can do to feel safe or in control.
Except that’s not actually true. Though anxiety can have both physical and mental symptoms, and we can’t just will it away, there are things we can do to calm ourselves.
I know because, like most of us, I’ve been there many times before, and I’ve coped both poorly and well.
I’ve panicked about panicking, believed every anxious thought, judged myself as weak, and tried to numb my feelings.
I’ve also breathed deeply, observed my thoughts, treated myself with compassion, and chosen to embrace my feelings—more and more often as I’ve gotten older.
Anxiety is common. It’s natural. It’s human. But we don’t have to let it control us.
These are some of the thoughts were and also because this reminded me just how common anxiety is.
Next time you’re feeling anxious, remember these comforting thoughts:
1. This will pass, and more quickly if you don’t resist it.
It's a wave I must let hit me and ride until it passes. Fighting it prolongs it and turns it into a riptide.
If you just let the current carry you to where it will for a little while, the river will eventually spit you out. Just go with it and it's going to be okay.
2. You can and will get through this—and this can make you stronger.
I verbally acknowledge and remind my inner child that it's okay, and “Adult Ria” will take care of it. That's where the anxiety arises from. I know as an adult that my success rate of surviving any crises I've faced is 100%. My little inner “Ria” gets scared and feels anxious, afraid, and insecure, so I just tell him that I have it in control.
I can handle whatever happens. I always have, one way or another. If things don't work out the way I expect then that's okay too. The anxiety will pass and I will be stronger afterward.
3. You are safe.
I breathe and repeat to myself: “I'm safe. I'm okay. I can take care of myself. I am powerful. I am significant.” Repeating it helps me refocus.
The situation isn't life or death. I'll live to see another day despite the outcome.
My mantra: “It's just adrenaline. It can't hurt you. It will pass.”
4. Your body is trying to protect you.
I’m not a dying zebra! I watched a Discovery programme that said stress is a natural part of our fight or flight response, which is helpful if you’re on the savanna running from a hungry lion.
Anxiety is my body's way of trying to protect me. My body has good intentions. It's just a little misguided. I'm grateful for my body's protection.
5. The past and future cannot hurt you in the present.
I try to think about what is causing me anxiety, and it is typically a thought or thoughts about the past or future. I remind myself that I am okay in this moment, and all we ever have is this moment. It helps me.
6. Thoughts can only hurt you if you give them power.
Since mine stems from thoughts that then spiral, I remind myself that thoughts are just that. They do not have to have meaning attached to them if I do not let them. Let them come in and out and give them no power, no meaning. Do not fuel them but let them come and go. They do not have to be reality, and most times they are not a reflection of reality or my true self, just plain old thoughts, and I do not have to react to every single one.
7. Worrying will not change the outcome.
I remind myself that my worrying will not change the outcome—never has and never will. Then I focus on what I'm grateful for, things that are beautiful and wonderful in my life right now. And lastly I repeat this: “I let go and I trust that I am being taken care of.”
8. What’s worrying you is temporary.
I try to remind myself that whatever is causing my anxiety is temporary and if I'm patient, it will be resolved.
I try very hard to remember that for most situations, they will pass whether I get all stressed out or not.
9. You have everything you need.
I try to remind myself that I have what I need: air, water, food, clothing, shelter. Then I remind myself to keep things in perspective and that I can choose how I am.
10. You’re stronger than you think.
I get anxiety over little things and I have to remind myself of how much I have overcome. I can get through the little stuff. Sometimes you just have to push through the discomfort of the situation and see it will be fine.
11. There's a lot going right.
I concentrate on what positive is going on right now this minute. I am safe, I have a good job, a family that loves me, and the ability to help people. I keep going until I feel the tension fading. Then slowly but surely I can clear my head enough to take on what lies ahead of me.
Things could be worse. I have my health. I try to count my blessings.
12. You are loved and supported.
I think of all the people who love me. I picture their faces and I imagine myself surrounded by a bubble of love, and as I'm breathing deeply I'm breathing that love in and out.
13. Things often aren’t as bad as they seem.
Four by four, how will I feel about this? Will it still seem huge and overwhelming looking back in four days, four weeks, four months, four years? It helps me to put things in perspective .
I ask myself: What are the most important things in my life, and then focus on that. What I am stressing about usually isn't one of the important things.
14. You can calm yourself by focusing on your breath.
Give your brain a simple task. Sit and breathe. Stare at a wall. Put yourself in time out and inhale slowly. You are not wasting your time. Thoughts will float into your mind. Let them keep floating. Re-align your spine as you sit. And breathe. Take ten minutes if you can. If you can't, even a minute is better than nothing.
Inhale for four counts, hold for seven counts, exhale for eight counts.
Breathe. If that doesn't work I run. It forces me to regulate my breathing. This will calm my body down forcing my mind to calm down as well.
15. Trust can sometimes be the antidote to anxiety.
Trust and anxiety are mutually exclusive so focus on trust, whatever you can trust at the moment, and anxiety moves out.
16. It helps to focus on what you can control.
“One step at a time.” I tend to become anxious because I worry and overthink things that I can't control and may or may not happen in the future. So I started to think this in my head whenever I notice the feeling creeping up. To take action one step at a time on something that I can control and let the rest run its course.
17. You don't need to have everything figured out right now.
Sometimes it's not enough to take it day by day. Sometimes, it's hour by hour, or even minute by minute. And if I breathe and stay calm, I can make better decisions to effect positive change with the situation with which I'm dealing.
18. Getting it out can help you let it go.
Write it down, get it off your chest, relax, make a plan of attack. Do something instead of worrying. Don't let it take away today's peace. Nothing stays the same!
19. You deserve your own love and compassion.
Anxiety can often come from a place of judgment of the self. Stop, breathe, and surrender to self-compassion.
20. You are not alone.
Know you're not alone. Others are struggling with something as well. We're all in this together!",GAD
92,"Treatment for generalized anxiety typically involves a combination of therapies:
Psychotherapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a common approach that helps individuals identify and modify negative thought patterns and behaviors contributing to anxiety. Other types of therapy, such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) or mindfulness-based therapies, may also be beneficial.
Medication: In some cases, doctors may prescribe anti-anxiety medications or antidepressants to help manage symptoms. These should be discussed with a qualified healthcare professional.
Lifestyle changes: Engaging in regular exercise, practicing relaxation techniques (such as deep breathing or meditation), maintaining a balanced diet, and getting sufficient sleep can contribute to overall well-being and reduce anxiety symptoms.
Stress management: Learning effective stress management techniques, such as time management, setting realistic goals, and engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation, can help alleviate anxiety.
Support network: Building a strong support system of friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and understanding. Sharing your feelings and experiences with others can be helpful.

94,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.

No marijuana or any other psychoactive substance.
Minimize caffeine intake. This one is tough because caffeine does help me focus, so I keep it to a minimum and follow it up with water, which leads to
Stay hydrated.
Choose food wisely. Eat small meals at a time. Chew each at least some bites mindfully, and thoroughly, thinking about where that food came.
Go for walks, in nature, and don’t bring my phone. I have a watch for the time.

tl;dr (for the rest of this): I monitor my thoughts, and choose to discontinue thoughts I deem unhelpful or contrary to my values.
Treating my physical body with love and respect is important and helpful, but the cognitive work I have done has provided the most relief. I spent many years thinking that external circumstances caused my anxiety. I did my best to avoid any situation that I deemed stressful. I rarely went to restaurants, concerts, or generally any social setting where I had to interact and negotiate with anybody, or where there were too many rules. As I got older, I got better at managing life (due greatly to the influence of my first wife), and I began to slowly recognize that I was feeling anxious even when my circumstances weren’t particularly stressful. Then one day, I had a particularly catalyzing event that made this truth undeniable, that my anxiety might be triggered by some external event, but the actual experience was some sort of chemical imbalance within me.
I was going to a festival with my daughter to deliver some supplies to a friend, and in exchange I would get in for free. The whole trip, everything was going perfectly. We were perhaps going to be 10 to 15 minutes later than I said, but the supplies weren’t need until later anyways. Traffic was perfect. We hadn’t forgotten anything. We had enough money to be comfortable. On the drive I began feeling intensely anxious. I kept looking for reasons why. Parking was going to be horrible because we were getting there late. At the time we were arriving, we’d probably have a 15 minute walk from the car in the heat. But we could drop the supplies at the gate no problem, then park. Did I remember what to bring? Yes I had everything. As we passed the volunteer parking lot right next to the entrance, the person at the gate recognized my daughter, called out her name, and waved us into a parking spot. We had gate side parking, in the shade, free passes, plenty of money, time with my daughter, friends, great music, a place to camp, all at one of my favorite festivals (because it’s small but exciting). I couldn’t find a single external reason to blame for feeling anxious. I had to accept that my anxiety is a state of being not dependent on circumstances. I had to accept that there is something wrong with me. That acceptance has made it much easier to make progress. Life is just life. I’m the one freaking out. This set the stage for the next step in reducing the impact of anxiety attacks on my life.
When I had to accept that external events were not causing my anxiety, and in fact were triggering them less and less as I got older and gained experience, I became more willing and able to examine my thought patterns. I love to let my mind wander. I love to fantasize. I write songs and stories and skits, and the wandering mind is a part of my creative process. One day, in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, I was driving along, fantasizing about how I could blow up the Goldman Sachs building. I was dreaming up ways of I could make it happen and maybe even get away with it. I noticed what I was thinking, and another part of myself asked out loud, do I really want to be thinking about that? It goes so completely contrary to my core values. I’m a pacifist. I don’t want to hurt anybody, even if they theoretically deserve it, which they almost never do. Why am I thinking about this? I could have made up the excuse that I was just fantasizing a plot line for yet another story I won’t write. What I really was doing was feeling powerless about the international financial crisis, and the fantasizing was a coping mechanism. I was also aware of how anxious I was feeling. The anxiety was causing me to latch on to the crisis as an excuse for what I was experiencing. I was driving too fast. I was twitchy and sketchy, fast breathing, things I experience when I’m anxious. The crisis wasn’t affecting me. I’m poor. I have no investments. I live in a poor county. I was almost completely unaffected by the financial crisis. Nothing much in my life changed. I was looking for an excuse as to why I was anxious, and the thoughts were adding to my anxiety, in a feedback loop.
So I started thinking about positive things, things were going good in my life, things I could do something about, and lo and behold, my anxiety lessened. It didn’t go away completely, it just had less influence over me. So that day, I made an agreement with myself. I’m going to start monitoring my own thoughts, and regularly ask myself, do I really want to be thinking about this? If the answer was yes, then think away. But if the answer was no, then think about something else. Typically, I would sing a song in my mind as a transition, then turn my thoughts towards something positive. It took me a couple of years to get good at it.
I still have panic attacks. I still am reluctant to put myself into certain situations even though it would benefit me. I avoid tasks that can trigger my anxiety, because it sucks. It feels awful. I hate it. But when it does happen, I know that it is a chemical, or perhaps electrical, imbalance within me. It’s as if I’m on a drug, and I will come down. I just have to ride it out, and meanwhile, think about things I like to think about. Think about things I have control over. I almost never take meds anymore. Only when it’s really bad and I have to function.",GAD
96,"Generalized anxiety disorder (or GAD)[1] is marked by excessive, exaggerated anxiety and worry about everyday life events for no obvious reason. People with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder tend to always expect disaster and can't stop worrying about health, money, family, work, or school.
Anxiety is the feeling of fear, worry, or unease, which most people experience occasionally. The stressful or unfamiliar situations and events that cause these feelings are what people call anxiety triggers.
Sometimes the worry/anxiety comes from inside, rather than outside. You can stress yourself out just by worrying about things.

[1] Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)",GAD
97,"Since I cannot take any medication for my anxiety disorder, I practice meditation. I use a free app on my iPad called Insight Timer that has thousands of guided meditations and soothing music. There’s even a free class that teaches how to meditate. The problem with anxiety is that when I feel panicked my breathing becomes rapid, causing more anxiety. Meditation helps me slow down and focus on taking deep breaths, in through the nose, hold for a few seconds and release it. Doing this over and over for the length of time I choose my meditation teaches me how to acknowledge my thoughts then let them go, each time bringing them back to the breath. It’s been very effective and I can now manage the extreme emotional feelings in my life on a daily basis. Additionally i see a therapist and attend a 12 step recovery program because I became addicted to benzodiazepines used to treat my anxiety disorder.",GAD
98,"The most effective solution for dealing with anxiety for me personally was waking up early. Iam not a morning person but once i tried this, i was surprised how good this made me feel. It helped me find peace and calm myself down. Having so much time in my hand I could do small things that made me happy and I felt a sense of accomplishment just by waking up early. I feel the most anxious during the night- so sleeping early really helped me tackle it to a great extent.
Meditation was another thing I tried when my anxiety was at its peak. Trust me- for someone who thinks a lot, it is no joke to shut your mind down and focus on your breathing. I could concentrate for very few minutes in the beginning but my thoughts kept spiraling back. So listening to some meditation music while i meditate helped me increase concentration. It helped me analyse my recurring thoughts and gave me more clarity about them.
Mostly during such times I don’t feel like interacting with anyone- thinking that nobody will really understand how i feel. It’s great if you can talk it out and rant everything going on in your mind to someone who cares to listen. Taking it all out really helps. If you’re someone who is not comfortable with addressing this with anyone, then you can try writing down all that is going on in your mind. Once you take it all out in any manner, you will feel relieved.
If you feel like you are stuck between your thoughts and feel very helpless, just do SOMETHING. Take a walk, call up your friends and talk about something random, play with your pet - just do something to break that cycle that is going on in your head. Do anything that will distract you even for sometime. Take action without overthinking anything. Just go for it.
Being positive and thinking right is almost impossible during such times. One of the main reasons i avoid talking to people during this time is because they may feel bad/ give some positive shit which is not what I want. You know yourself the best- try starting small and appreciating small wins. Having a motivational self-talk session/ looking in the mirror and giving yourself some positivity might help. Appreciate yourself for how far you have come and remind yourself about your strengths.
Try to get a balance of the basic things that need to be right- Sleep, food, health and water level. Once you get these things in check it will show better results over time.
Having any kind of physical activity or a workout routine will help you fight anxiety. Doing this releases endorphins which trigger a positive feeling in the body. It will also help you reduce stress, improve sleep and help in fighting with anxiety and depression.
If all the above things do not help and you are still stuck with being anxious, then there is just one way out. Confrontation. Ask yourself what is troubling you and analyse your thoughts. Address it and not run away from it. You have to feel the anxiety, be curious about it and seek answers and find out what is really going on. There will always be an underlying message or something you’re trying to run away from and are too weak to confront that. No matter how much you run away from it, sooner or later you will have to face it. This is a long process and you need to be strong and have patience to tackle it.
Lastly, know that YOU ARE NOT ALONE. This feeling is just temporary. Think of it as your body’s way to communicate something with you. We feel this only when we have lost perspective and when we are lacking inspiration. We have to just find ways to get out of the drama going on in our heads and gain perspective. Anxiety is something most of us go through at different levels. We are just too weak to talk about it. It is a part of being human- you are not alone.",GAD
99,"Whether it's generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, or just nerves, here are some techniques that will help you get it under control.
Rhythmic breathing. Breathe through your nose using your abdomen and count four in, hold four, four out. .
Visualization. Picture your neck relaxing, your forehead relaxing, your scalp relaxing and finally your eyes relaxing. As you do this your whole body melts away.
Affirmations. While doing these exercises say to yourself, ""I am calm and confident."" Repeatedly day this as you drift off to sleep. Use this trigger anytime you feel anxious.
Practice meditation. (It's very simple. Google for a method you like and practice. Many communities and colleges have groups who meet to practice.
Yoga. Pick a few poses that give you a good overall stretch. Nothing feels better than a well-led meditation after the gentle exertion of a yoga session.
Exercise. Daily exercise will not only relieve anxiety and restore self confidence, but it improves mood.
For any of these to work, practice religiously for three weeks and by then ethey will begin to become habits. with
To be effective, they need to be reflexive. At least the body response does. To facilitate that, associate a trigger with the relaxed state you hope to achieve.
A trigger is anything you can easily attach to the body state you are seeking. I find tactile and auditory work best for me.
Tactile can be as simple as touching thumb e rrlaced dtste.nand forefinger with the intention of stress draining out of your body. Use the techniques suggested above until the end state becomes familitar enough for you to drop immediately into the desired state.",GAD
100,"I found a ARNP that prescribes benzos. Best and cheapest fix. Other’s are lavender oil (Amazon), Ashwaganda, tylenol or advil, and check Healthline.com. A whole list of supplements for GAD. I used to take propranolol and now atenolol. For high blood pressure but used for GAD as an alternative for benzos. Get a pet, preferably a dog. They know and are soothing. Also use a HUGIMALS Weighted Stuffed Animal and a weighted blanket I was gifted but hot. Listen to Happiness Frequency: Serotonin, Dopamine, Endorphin Release Music, Release Negativity on YT on a loop and Tansy Forrest on a loop and Nicolas Wright on YT on a loop for night time sleep for nightmares. Have C-PTSD and easily triggered so my anxiety is through the roof.",GAD
101,"There is no quick, easy cure to anxiety.
But there’s so many ways to help ease it. I’ve been struggling with it my entire life and it never, ever just goes away. It just gets easier.
That quote has been my mantra for years.
Here’s some things you can do to make it easier:
-Practice breathing techniques. There’s so many online to try; my personal favorite is to breathe in for 8 seconds, hold for 7, let go for 7.
-Try medication or CBD. I use to drink CBD water and it helped calm me, but I got depressed from it, so I stopped using haha. It may work for you!
-See a therapist or try online therapy, sites like 7Cups.
-Try therapeutic ‘fidgets.’ Scented putty (lavender is the best), fidget spinners, weighted blankets, chewing jewelry, or fidget cubes may work for you.
-Whenever you’re having anxiety, think of the happiest place you’ve been at. Mine is a lake in the summer. I think of this and I pretend I’m there.
-Look around and find five things you can touch, four things you can see, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Feel free to mix it up, but this will help ground you and get you used to your surroundings.
Anxiety is tough but you’re never alone. Keep working at making your life easier and it WILL get better <3",GAD
102,"There is no real 100 percent cure for GAD. I’ve struggled with GAD for a long time but have found many ways to help manage it. The most effective ways to manage general anxiety in my own experience are medication such as SSRIs or SNRIs, moderate exercise such as brisk walking, jogging, swimming etc, cognitive therapy techniques such as labelling and challenging negative anxious thoughts, mindfullness meditation such as bringing your attention to the present moment and concentrating on slow deep breathing, healthy diet with limited amounts of sugar and caffeine which can both aggravate anxiety, good sleep patterns. I hope some of these techniques help you to manage your anxiety!!",GAD
103,"When anxious, you believe that something near you or in front of you has the power to destroy your life, which triggers a fight or flight response inside your body.
For example, people with social anxiety assume other people as a threat to their respect or existence.
A matter of danger.
‘The interaction would only bring negativity to me.’
Be it people, dark, exams, interviews, phone calls, doorbells, animals, heights etc you perceive it as an immediate threat.
You need to correct yourself with firmness and intensity-
“No, this can't destroy me. It doesn't have the power to destroy me, it's not so important, it's perceived by me as a threat and not a real threat.”
The foremost rule is to be able to handle negative outcomes, losses and wounds. The self-belief to overcome any loss, the perceived strength to be able to deal with the odds of life.
‘Okay, if something goes wrong, I will handle it.’
‘I have the required abilities to handle mishappenings.’
‘I don't care, I know I can deal with life.’
Understand that your perception is biased and influenced by notions, limited experiences, overthinking and overestimating.
A lizard peacefully spotting insects on a wall won't swallow you.
A person can reject you or your words, they can't destroy you, their rejection can’t destroy you, there would surely be a way out, you will surely meet more people, get fresh opportunities.
Be relived by the thought-
‘What will be will be.'
‘What has to happen will happen.’
‘Destiny shall unfold itself.’
‘Every action, event or situation is a way to take me to my destiny, be it negative, positive or neutral.’
‘If I lose something today, it's a step toward finding something new.’
Silent your mind for a few seconds by taking a deep controlled breath and focussing on your relevant action at the moment. “I need to do this and I shall do it well. That's it, that's all I can do.”
Close your eyes and think about what's good in life, realise that life is good, and realise that you are powerful and capable.
Always have an overall vision towards life, how you want to live your life overall, as a doer, as a strong personality, as a hero of your life, as someone who never stops, who faces every storm head-on.
Focus on learning through each event, especially the bitter ones, they teach you a lot for the future, a person rejecting or mistreating you would tell you a lot about psychology, your mistakes, and their attitude.
If you focus on learning, you observe each event from the sky, as a third person, without being directly involved with it. It reduces anxiousness.
Note down all positive interactions with that stimulus or matter: your and other people’s. This will help in correcting the flaws in your thoughts.
Celebrate the smallest of achievements of overcoming your fear, any positive interaction, any non-negative interaction, or any strong fight you gave to that event. Uplift yourself.

104,"Hi
Few tips are helpful:
Talk to Someone
Anxiety can lead us to believe that we are alone in our experience and no one will be able to relate. This is not true. Find a trusted person to talk with about your challenges. Share with important people in your life the experiences you are struggling with and don't be afraid to open up conversation. Being open about your challenges can also allow other people the space to share their struggles.
Recruit Support
Finding a support system is important when we are struggling with anxiety. There are a variety of support resources available, both in-person options and online, that can be of great help. A community of people who not only understand but can offer tips and suggestions for helpful coping strategies can be valuable.
Laugh
Anxiety tends to rob us of joy and gets in the way of us being able to have fun. Remember to nurture your longing to have fun and laugh. You can find humor in books, on television, or online sources. Taking a moment to laugh and have fun can offer a gentle reminder that the anxiety is not in charge.
Emotional Coping Strategies
Try these strategies for coping with intrusive thoughts, constant worry or fear, feelings of uncertainty, apprehension, dread, or overwhelm.
Mindfulness
There are varied practices of mindfulness that can help with anxiety. Using techniques like mindfulness, prayer, and deep breathing can help slow down our anxious processing of thoughts and emotions. By slowing down we are learning to be more present rather than hyper-focused on trying to anticipate and prepare for the future, which is what anxiety makes us focus on, even when there are no threats present.
Learn Your Triggers
As you practice slowing down and becoming more mindful, it will be helpful for you to pay attention to the situations that seem to trigger your anxiety. Although it won't always be an option to avoid those triggers, being aware of them can help you gain clarity and take steps toward managing stress in those specific situations.
Learning cognitive ways to challenge your anxiety can help, such as diffusing anxious thoughts and calming the need to keep asking ""what if.""
Practice Acceptance
Remember that anxiety is not something you are experiencing because you are flawed in any way. Anxiety is influenced by a host of factors such as genetics, neurobiology, family history, and life experiences. There is no one cause of GAD and it is something that many people experience.
As impossible as it may seem, it can be helpful to learn to accept the journey and embrace it as an opportunity to learn and care for yourself in healthy ways. Accepting your emotions can Improve health Identifying the emotions is the Step to achieving this.
Keep a Positive Attitude
There is no need to lose hope for better living. Many people challenged with anxiety, such as with generalized anxiety disorder, lead full, productive, and joyful lives. The key is taking time to learn what strategies work well for you, stay connected to others, and remain positive.
Find inspiration through quotes, verses, music, nature, social connections, etc. We are surrounded by positive examples of hope and inspiration.
Practical Coping Strategies
Practical coping can ease physical symptoms like insomnia, digestive troubles, and more. They can help with emotional symptoms as well.
Eat Well
What we put into our bodies can influence how we feel physically and emotionally. Foods do not cause anxiety, but making good food choices can help us keep our mind and body healthy. Eating things like sugary snacks and processed foods can lead to quick highs and lows in our blood sugar that can influence feelings of restlessness and fatigue.
Exercise
Moving your body can be a great way to manage stress. Exercise helps to boost our endorphins and relieve tension. Try something new or go with an old favorite activity you enjoy. Any way that you choose to exercise will be of benefit.
Keep a consistent schedule and try to incorporate exercise three to four times per week or more. You may also try massage or Progressive muscle relaxation to help ease muscle tension that is often experienced with anxiety.
Get Enough Sleep
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only 1 in 3 adults in the United States get the recommended seven hours of sleep at night. Although it can be difficult to sleep when we experience anxiety, creating a reliable nighttime routine can help us relax and prepare for quality sleep. Things like progressive relaxation, reading, and turning off electronics at least one hour before bed can help you prepare your mind and body for rest.
Breathing
Shortness of breath can be a common physical symptom of anxiety, along with a tightened chest and muscle tension. In those moments we often forget to breathe and take rapid, shallow breaths. Practicing how to take Slow abdominal breath can help.
A Word From Verywell
Things to keep in mind as you walk through your journey with generalized anxiety disorder is that you are not alone and you can live a full life. Although anxiety and worry may be an obstacle for you now, and even feel uncontrollable at times, there are resources, trained professionals, and coping techniques available to help. Learning how to navigate your triggers, reaching out for help, and keeping a positive attitude all help.
Taking care of yourself also involves talking with a professional who can put a Plan of treatment in place. Talking with a counselor or other mental health provider on a regular basis can be helpful as well, to know that someone understands your experience and can help you learn to effectively navigate challenges as they arise.

105,"I feel like a lot of parents say no but honestly phones. I read to help me escape but if you want to make friends the easiest way would be start small. Find One person you feel comfortable with and spend time with them getting to know them talking more, and then slowly add another person into your group someone or you also feel like you can trust and that you’re comfortable with. Continue this cycle and slowly start adding people that you generally enjoy this will help you socialize more and be less anxious in public.

106,"I really love my Instagram feed. Most of what I see is about anxiety and how to manage it (and pups.)
A couple of months ago I came across something that took my breath away.
A guy was saying -
The next time you feel anxious, locate the anxiety in your body. Where do you feel it?
Your shoulders? Your neck? Your chest?
I feel it in my chest. I feel a tight feeling - like I can't breathe.
So, he says, place both your hands on this place.
So I put both my hands on my chest.
Breath into it. Deep breaths. Deep breaths.
Then, say to your anxiety the following:
You belong here.
See how that feels.
This made me cry because it got me thinking how much I am at war with some of the things I feel. I don't want them here. I want to be carefree.
Suddenly saying ""you belong here"" shifted something in me. Like I can just let her be here. She can keep me company if she wants to.
Managing anxiety is incredibly hard. It requires a lot of work and even life design.
But maybe a good first step is to make it more of a partnership and less of a war.",GAD

108,"I have gone through the anxiety and depersonalization disorder and overcame successfully….
METHODS I USED TO OVERCOME :
From my experience i can tell you clearly and directly these type of disorders are the results of wrong thinking or overthinking , wrong lifestyle,“narrow perception of REALITY”, or you can say wrong believe system ,and these things took me to these disorders , i worked on my “believe system” and “lifestyle” and it is kind of “reprogramming or updating the previous software of mind” .
• First of all if you have a panic attack then 1000% you are not going to die .
• Hyperventilation : With anxiety disorder that choking feeling you got , you only got that feeling because you take breath very short, take consciously deep breathes, first the breath should go in your diaphragm and then into lungs , in this way the body will return to the right pattern of breathing.
• Now getting rid of depression , “DO MEDITATION DAILY” AT MORNING, i started doing meditation with “headspace app” after ten days of doing meditation with “headspace app” you can do it easily by yourself without app, if you can do meditation daily no stress can even touch you .
• EXERCISE daily at morning, well i am not a gym freak , i do not go to gym, i do it at home after doing meditation , take break for 15 minutes and thanks to the Universe , thanks for the resources you have , thanks the universe to giving you a right direction , thanks for everything , see the sun thank the sun , PRACTICING GRATITUDE is very important ,
and radically FORGIVE EVERYONE , after doing that do push-ups but do it more than 10 and every day increase the limit , do 10 squats , go for running everyday , exercise is very important for recovery it makes brain and body healthy .
• DIET : Avoid junk food , and DO NOT SMOKE PLEASE! the smoking addiction was hard to tackle , do not fall into any addicition that will wrose the recovery , drink juice , eat fresh fruits , DRINK 7 GLASS OF WATER DAILY NO MATTER WHAT ,
“ have good diet to win this fight” ,
eat almonds , dry fruits , whatever that “fruit” is eat it .
Now with a pen and paper plan the next day accordingly and follow through , to wake up early morning i use Mel Robbin’s 5 sec rule , when alarm rings i visualize in mind rocket is launching and countdown has started and start counting backwards 5 4 3 2 1 and WAKE-UP rocket launched , and
“if you wanna change yourself , start off by making your bed in the morning” so clean-up your bed this is your first task and go complete other tasks .
Drink a glass of water , look in mirror ,smile , say “ i am who i have been looking for” with great feel , wash the face , and go follow the routine you have made . Be mentally strong enough to follow the routine , start will be difficult and if you keep following you will adapt in few days.
Read books as much as you can , be a learner , consider your past as a “school” which taught you many great lessons of life , learn from your personal experience from your mistakes , failures and success , from others experience from their failures and success , listen to highly successful people .
Its all about “Mindset”",GAD
109,"There are so many possible answers to this. People find different ways to cope with their anxiety. I can tell you I have severe anxiety along with ptsd. Some of the ways I’ve found to help me has been counting. Not just normal counting but by 3s or any number. I’ll count to 100 and then go back down to 0. It’s been a good way to calm down. Positive self talk is a huge one. Even when you’re telling yourself you can’t do something, override that voice and tell yourself that you can. Keep repeating that you can.
In the end anxiety is just a big, bad bully that’s all bark and no bite. You’re in control, even though your anxiety is going to make you feel like it’s in control - it never will be. Any hold it has on you is a facade and it just hopes you’ll never realize that.",GAD
110,"If you’re unfortunate enough to be an individual that’s prone to go into panic attacks as a result and not knowing what to do about it. First time it happened to me was not ideal to say the least. Was on my way to a location over an hour way to deliver medical equipment when suddenly I began to lose feeling in my arms. Barely managed to pull over safely just in time because as I did they went limp. Idk how else to describe it other than when your foot falls asleep except it was both arms from shoulder blades all the way down.
I had no idea what was going on, thought maybe I was having a heart attack but that’s supposed to just be one arm, so figured possibly a stroke though again that’s typically one sided. Turns out I was hyperventilating which basically just means you’re not giving your lungs enough time to process each breath in order to do what it needs to do to feed your blood properly. Which is why rapid breathing causes people to pass out and incidentally which I had never heard of personally can cause you to lose feeling in your arms or legs.
I struggled with this in fear of how to anticipate stress with this development as was in my late twenties and had never experienced any anxiety like this before, was very concerning and confusing because I’ve always had anxiety, introverted tendencies and been in all kinds of situations, house fire, car accidents, attacked without Warning, cornered & jumped, mugged, stalked, harrassed, threatened, chewed out, singled out, made an example of, had to defend myself with force, attacked with a bat, use to rock climb/parkour, forced to perform physically, jumped off cliffs, atracked by a swarm of wasps, arrested, malested, tramautized, ptsd even chocked to the floor by my own father till i pissed myself once.. Had never even passed out, none of that had prepared me for or had any bearing in terms of serving me to effectively navigate the situation. Second time it happened i was just walking across my apt to take a load of laundry down. When completely without warning, lost feeling in both my legs, collapsed to the floor. My friend was convinced i was faking, even came over & kicked me before he realized i wasnt fuvckin round.
Id say whether you get panic attacks or not the worst thing about anxiety is the helplessness. Not knowing what to do. Luckily the solution regardless of the severity is the same. Learn to be mindful of youre breathing, practice controlling your breathing. Then eventually by doing this youll begin to start recognizing when you're starting to get like this, with practice you can stop it in its tracks entirely. Before i learned this had 4 incidents in total over a 4–5 year period. Hasnt happined since i mastered my breathing which no matter how. Much ive practiced never do i feel confident that its going to work, because thats what anxiety does to you, magnifies your doubts an insecurities, thats the final hurdle is pushing yourself to ignore what your head is telling you and focusing on doing what you are able to do in order to regain control of the situation. The reason this was such a challenge, in my experience was because i just somehow completely oblivious towards and unaware of how i was breathing. I mean how often do you actually think about the way you're breathing? The body does it for you. Ppp",GAD
111,"Not to understand what triggers your anxiety or when it does trigger.
GAD is a lame diagnosis in my opinion because it means that you have anxiety but the doctor doesn’t know where it comes from.
You know you can get a formal diagnosis and find out what triggers your anxiety. First take the time to find a good psychologist/Therapist that specializes in trauma. If you don’t think the first therapist you meet you feel comfortable with try someone else. I have had a few dumb ones. Find one that’s been in practice for at least 20 years. ( They have lots more wisdom) When you find a therapist that you feel very comfortable with tell them about you GAD and ask them “I want to know why I have anxiety? “ tell them you want to know who you really are. Then start from the beginning of your first memory, what it was like grow up and how you felt as a child, did you have or see anything that scared you or didn’t make sense.
If you can feel comfortable enough to tell them everything and spill it all out on the table then You will be farther ahead that most people that think nothing is wrong with them but they’re always grumpy or the drink, smoke too much or never come out of the house. You will be much more confident and self assured to tackle any situation. You will grow as a person and be ahead in the maturity area than most people your age. It would be a very wise, intelligent and brave thing to do because You are Worth it. You matter. Make it happen!",GAD
112,"I was going to say that the scariest thing about generalized anxiety disorder is the lack of ability to control anxiety once it starts.
Now that I think about it, I actually find physical/psychosomatic symptoms of GAD to be a bit scarier than that because they are even less predictable.
I've had rather severe pains in my back several times after having had anxiety attacks.
They always come on after I assumed the anxiety attack had passed.
I've come down with illnesses shortly after having had anxiety attacks as well.
I'd only just recently learned that anxiety can manifest as physical symptoms beyond anxiety attacks.
I think not being able to predict whether or not I will develop muscle pains or fall ill is the scariest aspect of living with generalized anxiety disorder…for me, anyway.",GAD

I'm very cautious about taking my medication for GAD because it can be quite addictive and lead to chemical dependency. I have disassociation with my CPTSD sometimes. Though it has only happened twice, IF I AM DRIVING, IT'S REAL BAD. I gotta pull over until it passes ot I'll lose familiarity with my arms, legs, feet, and hands.

I was the new girl in town, the school I started going to was very small and everyone there knew each other since like Kindergarten! Anyways, in my English class we had done some essay on our favorite songs and why. Well I decided to pick my favorite song at the time, which was “Hold on Till May - By Pierce The Veil”. (My post hard core stage LOL) But, this song had helped me to not commit suicide, so it really made an impact on my life, and the song was something very dear to my heart,(still is). And when I went up in front of the class to do my presentation, I just started looking around the room frantically, turning red, started practically hyperventilating IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS, and started to cry my eyes out and ran out of the room cause I felt so overwhelmed and nervous I had no choice but to run. Fight or flight mode. So I skipped school for the rest of the day, then come to find out the next day at school my English teacher had asked me what that was all about and that if I had anxiety that bad I could of just let him know aside from everyone and I wouldn’t of had to do my presentation! COOLEST ENGLISH TEACHER EVERRRRR.",GAD
118,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
119,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
120,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

121,"The scariest aspect of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is the persistent and excessive worry about everyday situations, often accompanied by physical symptoms like tension, irritability, and restlessness. It can severely impact daily life and relationships, leading to avoidance behaviors. Effective treatment typically involves therapy, medication, or a combination, tailored to individual needs. For more insights on managing anxiety disorders, you can explore my Quora Profile.",GAD

123,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
124,"Here’s an average school day:
A.L = Anxiety Level, 0% being completely calm and 100% being anxiety attack.
6:45 AM - Wake up and hope that my legs aren't paralyzed from social anxiety. If so, I have to wait two to three hours for it to go away. [A.L: 30% normally, 50% if woke up from nightmare]
7:00 AM - Try to block out my mother’s and sister’s arguing to hurry up when both of them are on their computers/tablets, or when my sister refuses to get up and my mom has to get her dressed. Music with noise-canceling headphones usually do the trick.
7:30 AM - After telling me when she gets home later that afternoon and checking to see if my legs are paralyzed, mom takes my sister to school, I stay on the sofa listening to music.
10:40 AM - Nine times out of ten, my legs heal and I’m able to slowly walk around the house. I get dressed, wash up, and get out the door with my messenger bag by 10:45.
10:50 AM - Deep breaths as I walk the half mile to school, listening to music as I go down the sidewalk. Because my brain didn’t remind me about the medicine (sometimes even if I get a miracle and remember), every time a car passes by, one or more of the following thoughts goes through my head:
“Pedophile.”
“If the car pulls up beside you, run.”
“Please don’t get near me.”
“Don’t be a crazy person and try to run me over.” (Even though I’m on the sidewalk.)
“Just keep walking.”
11:00 AM - If I left correctly and paced myself correctly, I arrive at a ten-foot-long crosswalk that is at the entrance to the student parking lot. My school, like any high school, has a lot of rude teens. I stop at the crosswalk, look both ways and down the road to check for cars, and speed-walk to the other side while holding my breath as if I was trying to commit a crime. [
[Off chance I get there at 11:02 - Cars fill the entrance as each driver tries to get onto the main road. I can feel their judging eyes on me as I approach the crosswalk. I could feel their annoyances as they only want to go to lunch and don’t want to wait a second longer because some crazy walker girl decides to come to school at this exact time. I make my first step, making eye contact with the driver as my pace speeds up and I run to the other side. Although, if I wait long enough, someone else could be on the other side of the crosswalk. The pure blessed coincidence lets me know that it’s safe to cross without getting yelled at, as I’m not the only one crossing. I make it to the other side and take a deep breath. I survived.]
11:05 - I meet up with a couple friends and we chat and play around during lunch hour. It often starts with me going up to our second-floor meeting spot and me apologizing for being out of breath and tired. They both nod and say it’s okay, as both of them know about my anxiety. It’s only during this time when my defenses are lowered. [A.L: 20%, 40–70% if trigger passes by.]
12:03 - Bell rings, I say goodbye and go to my first class (everyone else’s fifth class). I happen to have something called “Office Aide”, where I get to help out the administrators in the discipline office. For me, it’s a social exercise. Whenever I’m not called to do something, I hang out in the staff lounge and listen to music (bonus points if I’m the only one there, excluding the occasional admin or two). Occasionally I get to deliver papers from one office to another, or manage the printer for a teacher who needs copies.
However, there is one activity that is the most common, and by far what I hate the most: Pass delivery. Which requires organizing the passes from nearest to farthest away, mentally highlighting the fifth period classes for each student, and checking every ten seconds to make sure they are in correct order and I didn't make any mistake. Then it’s opening the door and having 20–23 pairs of eyes following my every step and action, while I have to keep my eyes on the teacher, who I just interrupted their lesson with something from the office. As soon as I give the teacher the pass(es) and explain what they’re for in short sentences, I do a 180 u-turn and bolt right through the door. Once I get through, I take a breather and go on to the next classroom. Repeat as needed.
The next couple classes are easier. The teachers know I have GAD and give me permission to listen to concentration music to block out all the other background noises from other classmates.
After school, I meet up with my friends again, chat, and then head home. Repeat 11:02 behavior except everyone wants to go home and are even more reckless. Honking makes me jump and bolt to the other side, only crossing the crosswalk when others are crossing at the same time as me.
Same paranoia with walking home as in the morning.
3:00 PM - I unlock the house door and collapse on the sofa after taking off my bag and changing out of my collared-shirt uniform to something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m being lightly choked. Start slow work on writing and homework, as well as completing all necessary assignments for online classes-
5:00 PM - A weird taste gets in my mouth as I wake up from accidentally passing out and having no memory how I got to the sofa or how I managed to fall asleep. Realize the time and panic for a little that I only have 30 minutes before mom and sister come home.
5:30 PM - Chaos ensues. Katie starts shouting and pulling my very-tired mother to go play with her on Minecraft or Roblox, not caring that she’s been working a min-paying job for seven hours. I have no-where to go to escape. My mom retreats to her room to nap, while my sister puts on her earphones and shouts for mom to go to her. I end up being the middle-man and play messenger until I remind mom that she’s a mother. I put on my headphones and lower my 70% anxiety with more music and watching videos.
This continues until my grandmother likely comes over and I have to hide, least a panic attack would be triggered and I’d be punished by her for not fully calming down in 15 minutes and that I’m “crazy”. (She’s no help is my point.)
10:00 PM - House is blissful. Mom and sister are asleep, I’m on the sofa again either typing stories, reading and answering Quora questions/articles, playing Sims 4, or researching psychology.
4:00 AM - Insomnia holds me hostage. I have stared at the ceiling for hours. Every little sound I hear wakes me up like a monster is trying to get into the house. I have a light on in the living room to keep me out of the dark and so I have full sight of my immediate surroundings. AC unit kicks in every once in a while, my mind often mistaking it as some madman trying to invade the house by going through the vents, same with creaking of the door or leaves bouncing along the ground outside by the wind.
This repeats every day. It changes very little during weekends and school breaks; Everything around me is terrifying, leaves scare me, people remind me that I don’t belong in this world, and my family is just another obstacle for me to overcome along with my anxiety. I write a lot as a result; writing is my escape path. I wish I can write more, but I don’t want to annoy you with long things to read. ^_^
That’s my daily life with anxiety. I have my good and bad days, and every day is very draining. My family tell me to be more social, that I should be this or that like what other teenage girls do. I ignore all that crap and focus on taking care of myself and know where my limits lie. I have GAD because of my surroundings, but now I try not to let my surroundings summon what it created.
To anyone else reading these answers who have GAD, you’re not alone. Take care of yourself and stick by those who truly care for you. :)",GAD
125,"everything about it is a pain in the ass, before being affected by GAD I’ve always suspected I had it, I would always find a reason to not do something because I’d be scared of what affects my choices could have on the future, but sadly it has psychical symptoms with it too, I still go to school and it just happens randomly, I’d feel a bit of chest pain/back pain/shortness of breath/lightheadedness and sometimes I’d stay up asleep because i was scared of what could possibly happen to me the next morning, I’d be alright but the night before I always felt like I was having a heart attack or slowly dying, I’d constantly beg my parents to bring me to the hospital even though it’s been confirmed by many doctors, psychiatrists and my school counselor that it’s just my anxiety that makes me feel that way:/
and a few weeks ago it really bothered me to the point where I started eating less, I don’t know if GAD was the cause but I was experiencing loss of appetite too, I ended up losing 10 pounds but thankfully I’m starting to eat more:p",GAD
126,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
127,"Today I had to go to an appointment that was at 2pm, so naturally I started checked the time every 5 minutes at 9am to make sure I wasn’t going to be late. When I locked the door to my house, I started imagining what if one of my cats got out what would I do.. what would the uber do.. When my uber was close, I start thinking they wont see me and just drive away and then I’ll be late. I always panic about slamming the door too hard. Walking in public I tend to have the same thoughts, am I walking to fast? Can they see I’m sweating? Is there something on my ass? Why did they look at me like that? Why’d I smile like that, now they think I’m some weirdo. As well as rehearsing what I’m going to say to the receptionist and stopping by the washroom to make sure that the person who looked at me wasn’t doing it because there was something on my face. Then pretty much the same journey on my way home, except the absolute terror of me accidentally getting into the wrong car instead of the uber. I don’t know what I would do if that happened. I haven’t done much with the rest of the day, but I can tell you I’ve spent a good 30 minutes now re reading and editing this post that maybe a couple people will read.

128,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
129,"People with anxiety feel okay, fine most of the time. I had not beign diagnosed with anxiety. I'm sure I have it. I do not considerate I have a generalized anxiety. As is something that come unexpected and last a few minutes up to 20 minutes. And is not happening every day. If not a twice per month.
Started right after my husband passed away. Come unexpectedly. How do I know I have it? I recognize it. Start out of nowhere. If I'm in a place where I had to wait for a while longer in line. If I'm looking at something specific ( will not tell) usually I started to move one of my legs non stop for a minute. I can control the leg movement. When I start to move it and when to stop it. Is my way to cope with that sudden anxious feeling. Like when you rock slowly back and forth a child to console. I think moving the leg is the same for a anxious person. Is a copying mechanism.
I had witnessed people do this leg movement in public and in restaurants . A family was having dinner. The male in the family shacked his legs non stop. Looks out of place to be doing that.
Well, is a sign the person do not like to wait, is in a hurry for something or is anxious. I have days when I feel great. I had days when all seems fine, and later on in the same day . I started to felt anxious out of nowhere. Without nothing triggers that.
I have an enormous amount of energy. If I don't release it. Can be overwhelming. So, is important to letting out the excess of energy. Exercises is the answer to me.
I would recommend to take a warm/hot bath. Do exercises like walking, dancing, cycling. I had never tried Yoga. I think could be a good idea for someone else to do. Drink a relaxing or antistress tea.",GAD
130,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD

132,"I do not believe there is a test that would be able to measure or even tell if you have any anxiety.
As it is a “fear of?” it all depends on how you react to certain situations.
Anxiety is hard to get rid of, as we all have a form of it, and when it takes over your mind, that is when you would need a mild benzo family pill to help you stay calm.
We have to gear something, otherwise we would not have any sense of danger. Yes I know there are people who are dare devils, but I am sure they have a fear of sorts.
It is having control and taking charge of your anxiety if you have it bad enough.
Without a proper assessment, there is only guesses. No definite answer.
The best way is to see a psychologist, as most psychiatrists turning around to be treated the same way as Depression, which it can lead to if you let it take over your mind and way of thinking.
You may just be feeling a bit shaky or nervous, but is that because of anxiety or is there another underlying condition?
I would talk to your primary care giver first, before wasting a lot of time and money on psychologist, as a simple blood test might show something is not quite right.
Talking through a problem with either a professional or a family/friend you know well and are able to trust, could also help find out what is really bothering you.",GAD

139,"Yes.
I personally overcame a GAD (which started with several panic attacks at night); 3 doctors told me that, given the severity of symptoms, in my case it would be impossible to overcome this without antidepressants & sleeping pills first… and they were wrong. I was personally convinced that it was possible not to take these drugs but one told me “you know all patients think they can overcome this but it’s a lure, they’re not doctors they don’t know…”. I’ve literally spent 4 months through hell: recurring panic attacks, 3 hours of sleep nightly, debilitating pains the back that made it impossible to concentrate at work, I had the productivity of a 12-year-old child… But I studied the topic of anxiety and depression and I came to realize 2 things:
Our doctors with 10 years of studies aren’t so smart as they think about this issue, they just prescribe pills that they know “work” which means it hides the symptoms for most people (after trying 2, 3 for many of them) but don’t cure the root cause of anxiety. At best it will break a vicious circle, but your body is a very sensitive system and putting in something that will play with your neurotransmitters for 6-month will obviously alter something in your brain.
Mental disorders are more than we think an organic disease (such as liver cirrhosis for an alcoholic) than “psychological” diseases related to the way we think, childhood memories etc. (Doctors are behaving like all mental disorders are genetic or caused by a psychological trauma but it’s not always the case and in fact I would think that in the majority of cases people develop mental problems due to poor lifestyle which range from unhealthy diet to stressful jobs, toxic people, even heavy metals intoxication: I know this one is crazy but check Doctor’s Mark Hyman videos on YouTube you will see it’s true for thousands of people)
So now let’s do a quick summary of how I did it:
Never take benzos, I took them at first (Xanax) and it worsened the situation so badly, withdrawal was so hard. The only thing I took that was beneficial was Atarax (1st gen antihistaminic), it has a calming effect, helps sleep a little bit but nothing compared to a benzo, and it’s not addictive. BENZOS ARE DANGEROUS DRUGS, to me their effects were 5x more powerful than what I ever experienced with anything else, I couldn’t imagine something that was prescribed by a doctor could actually be a drug more dangerous than some illegal drugs… But it is.
Take time off (like 1-2 month) if your job is stressful in order to concentrate on healing your disease. But see people, friends, family, even animals, it’s key to healing.
HEAL YOUR BRAIN BY HEALING YOUR BODY FIRST. THE SAME THINGS THAT MAKE US SICK ALSO MAKE US ANXIOUS. Anxiety disorder is when anxiety is present everywhere without even being triggered by a negative thought. It’s clearly a brain dysfunction, you have to heal it. In my case it was not because I had bad thoughts that it triggered anxiety feeling in my body, anxiety feelings in my body did trigger bad thoughts. My body had become sick because of months of bad habits. For me that first horrible panic attack started after 4 months of hard partying every friday, saturday, + stressful job with late hours (1–2 in the morning), my body was completely exhausted and sick but I didn’t want to believe it.
Very short term: try soft medicine: acupuncture and hypnosis worked really well for me, but with reliable practitioners not some king of gurus
Short: STOP ALCOHOL, COFFEE AND REFINED SUGAR. You’ll probably be craving all of them for 2 weeks but after this you’ll REALLY feel better. Stop any other excitants if you’re taking them (ginseng etc.). Once you’ve recovered, limit your alcohol consumption to the bare minimum, it’s toxic for your brain.
Short (2 weeks to see the first effects), medium & long term: completely change the way you eat, eat organic food, lots of veggies, fruits, omega-3 fatty acids; add probiotics, vitamins, magnesium & zinc to your diet if necessary, food is the key to healing tons of chronic diseases for which we wrongly use antidepressants (IBS, fybromalgia, depression, anxiety… and even some autoimmune diseases)
Practice sport regularly (3, 4 times a week) but don’t get too hard on you in a time you’re really exhausted. It’s not the right moment to do an iron man.
And? It’s about everything. Another important one is to believe in god and do the good around you.
If you’re really to the point where you tried all this above and it doesn’t work, take ADs to break this vicious circle but still keep all those good habits above so you won’t relapse after stopping the medication. It’s not a shame to suffer from anxiety or depression, we all have to face our own issues, for some it’s obesity, others it’s diabete, for us it’s anxiety. Even if as you can read I don’t trust the pharmaceutical industry (their goal is to make money by selling the most medications as possible, the more side effects the more additional medications to sell) and I think doctors’ arrogance makes them blind about this plague, don’t waste the most beautiful years of your life fighting a disease. If after months and months of all what I told above you still have the problem (which I believe is unlikely though), go seek medication, it probably means your anxiety is related to something else. And as I told above, Atarax worked for me with almost no withdrawal symptoms (but its effect is mild)

140,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD

142,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings.

144,I didn’t know specifically what type of disorder I had but at 7 I definitely knew something was off. Turned out I have GAD.,GAD
145,"Being diagnosed with GAD is obviously not very heartening considering the daily trauma that you already go through. It is all the more difficult since GAD means you find it difficult to understand specifics in terms of situations or instances where you tend to get anxious.Everything tends to get you anxious (atleast in my case)
I too was diagnosed with GAD. I tend to fear anything and everything which happens with or around me. On my way to work, i am worried about the worst that could happen to me, on the way back i am still worried about the same and at the same time i am worried about getting into an accident while driving. At home i am constantly thinking about all the worst situations which may happen to me. I have this anxious bout in my stomach througout the day, no matter if it is a weekend or a weekday. Drinking helped only to sleep for sometime but once i am awake things repeat and its the same pattern, i am always worried.
I met a couple of phycatrists for the same and both concluded that i had GAD. One suggested counselling while the other suggested some medications. However, i was somehow not convinced to accept either of those.
After reading about GAD, i did realize that there is no magic treatment or medication for GAD or any anxiety related disorders. Since it is directly related to our thoughts it is really difficult to control the same using medications (they may help suppressing it, but not remove it altogether). I decided not to take any counselling or medication
What i did was, i spoke to my best friend about it. I discussed everything and every thought i had. It was a huge relief. I joined a gym and started working out. The 1 hour that i spend in the gym helps me stay occupied and also distracts me enough to ensure that i do not fall in the trap of my thoughts. The anxious bouts have now reduced (although i still do get them) , my drinking habit has changed.
I still do keep on talking about it, however now i do not confident that i can tackle the disorder more effectively than before . I am still in the process of getting out of it , but what i have realized in distraction is the best medicine. Taking small steps to distract your mind and keep it focussed for smaller durations has done wonders to me. Eventually it would become a habit and the mind will no longer be able to trick you or me into the lost world.
Hope this helps. Keep fighting and do not give up.

149,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
150,"No Dr. here to answer your question. However, this one is for the author of this question: how can anybody, any decent human being, a professional in the field ever confuse explained anxiety for ‘generalized anxiety’? What a joke!",GAD
151,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!

95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.

155,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
156,"Thanks for the A2A.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD
157,"I’ve had GAD for ~20 years. Ditto for major depressive disorder. (The two interact in a complex way, but basically having an episode of one makes the other worse.)
I’ve found the following to be very helpful in managing my GAD:
Regular aerobic exercise (bicycling, brisk walking, running, swimming, aerobics exercises). What works best for me is exercising 3–4 times/week at an intensity that stops my brain and body from worrying/brooding for at least 30 minutes.
Doing something that I enjoy that requires focus. For me, that means playing a musical instrument, woodworking or working at the computer.
In addition to other meds for depression, I take 1–3 mg of Klonopin daily. I’ve been on that dosage for 10 years under the care of the same psychiatrist I’ve seen for ~15 years. I see him at least every 3 months with more frequent visits if I’m going through a particularly rough patch. In my opinion and based on my own experience, “don’t take benzodiazepines” is a decision that must be made by you and your doctor. If you can manage your anxiety without medication, great.

158,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.

159,"Since I cannot take any medication for my anxiety disorder, I practice meditation. I use a free app on my iPad called Insight Timer that has thousands of guided meditations and soothing music. There’s even a free class that teaches how to meditate. The problem with anxiety is that when I feel panicked my breathing becomes rapid, causing more anxiety. Meditation helps me slow down and focus on taking deep breaths, in through the nose, hold for a few seconds and release it. Doing this over and over for the length of time I choose my meditation teaches me how to acknowledge my thoughts then let them go, each time bringing them back to the breath. It’s been very effective and I can now manage the extreme emotional feelings in my life on a daily basis. Additionally i see a therapist and attend a 12 step recovery program because I became addicted to benzodiazepines used to treat my anxiety disorder.",GAD
160,"Lessons I Have Learned From My 20 Year Struggle With Fear And Anxiety
By: Stan Popovich
I dealt with fear and anxiety for over 20 years and here are some lessons I learned during my mental health struggles.
1. Listen To The Professionals And Not Your Friends: Your friends may mean well, but when it comes down to it, the professionals know your situation more than anyone. They know what you are going through and are trained to deal with your situation. Consult with a counselor when you have questions about your mental health issues.
2. Distance Yourself From People Who Give You A Hard Time: Distance yourself from those people who won’t make an effort to help understand what you are going through. You need to surround yourself with positive and supportive people. I felt better when I avoided those people who would constantly argue with me regarding my anxieties and stresses.
3. Focus On The Facts of Your Situation And Not Your Thoughts: When people are depressed they rely on their fearful and negative thoughts. Your fearful thoughts are exaggerated and are not based on reality. When you are depressed, focus on the facts of your current situation and not on what you think.
4. Learn From Your Experiences: In every anxiety-related situation I experienced, I learned what worked, what did not work, and what I needed to improve on as I managed my fears and anxieties. For example, you have a lot of anxiety and you decide to take a walk to help you feel better. The next time you feel anxious you can remind yourself that you got through it the last time by taking a walk.
5. You Can’t Predict The Future Regardless What Your Thoughts May Tell You: No one can predict the future with one hundred percent certainty. Even if the thing that you are afraid of does happen, there are circumstances and factors that you can’t predict which can be used to your advantage. For instance, you miss the deadline for a project at work. Suddenly, your boss comes to your office and tells you that the deadline is extended and that he forgot to tell you the day before. This unknown factor changes everything.
6. Things Change Over Time: Regardless of your current situation, things do not stay the same. You may feel very bad today, but it won’t last forever. Everything changes over time and this includes your current mental health issues.",GAD
161,"I recently discovered it. I knew I had anxiety, I was seeing a psychiatrist for it and taking medicine. It wasn't until I had a spinal fusion I got a proper diagnosis/diagnoses. I took a pain medicine called oxycodone because the nurse gave it to me and I'm 14 and i didn't know there were side affects. My blood pressure dropped dangerously low I couldn't stay awake for more than 30ish minutes. My cortisol levels dropped and I was out. When I woke up they handled my blood pressure levels but never took me off the oxycodone. I started to have 6 to 8 panic attacks a day in the hospital even though I wasn't in ICU. 2 days later I started hallucinating. I saw very gory and messed disgusting things that no one would ever imagine. It lasted for 7 days. I got PTSD from this. When I went to a different psychiatrist she said my anxiety progressed to GAD or even maybe a little worse, along with the PTSD that I'll have forever. I use CBT therapy to help me with every.",GAD
162,"your daily Stress may lead to restlessness, irritability, lack of sleep, constant worry and anxiety. These could be signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Living with anxiety might be difficult but there are various self-help guidance techniques that can be practiced for the well-being of an individual. These include:
Social interaction: A support system plays an important role to overcome GAD Social interaction with people who can be trusted is effective in calming the nervous system thus reducing anxiety. It could be a family member or friend. Build a strong social network and interact to avoid being in isolation. Avoid situations or people who make you feel negative or anxious.
Lifestyle modifications: These changes include change in the sleep pattern, diet, regular exercises, limiting the intake of alcohol and caffeine.

164,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
165,"Managing symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) often involves a combination of therapeutic approaches and lifestyle changes. Some strategies include:
1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Learning to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.
2. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety.
3. Regular Exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.
4. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake can positively impact anxiety symptoms.
5. Stress Management: Learning effective time management, setting realistic goals, and practicing assertiveness can help manage stressors.
6. Social Support: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional comfort and reduce isolation.
7. Medication: Consult a psychiatrist about the potential benefits of anti-anxiety medications.
8. Avoidance Reduction: Gradually facing anxiety-provoking situations can help desensitize the fear response.
9. Journaling: Writing down thoughts and feelings can help gain insights and provide an outlet for emotions.
10. Professional Help: Consulting a mental health professional for guidance, support, and personalized treatment.
You should work closely with your healthcare provider or therapist to maximise this strategies to your advantage,whenever you feel anxious,its better to face it than seek a way of avoiding it or playing a victim

166,"I am a chemical engineer suffering from anxiety probably since early childhood. I can think of several ways how the condition negatively affected me - development of my personality, my relationships (being completely shy and withdrawn around girls) and my physical health. And I can witness that meds (SSRI in my case) significantly improved quality of my life. Please give it a try.
As for the brain chemistry alteration, please note that these meds don’t “add” chemicals to your brain but prevent your brain from decomposing the serotonin.
Don’t go into the “hard” antidepressants that kick in immediately. As far as I understand it these should be used only in severe cases (e.g. tendency to commit suicide).
And if you decide to start with SSRI (with guidance of your psychiatrist of course) give them time of at least one month to make effect. In the beginning your condition might get worse and sleep disorders are almost sure thing. But the positive effects outweigh the negative.

168,"Hi
Few tips are helpful:
Talk to Someone
Anxiety can lead us to believe that we are alone in our experience and no one will be able to relate. This is not true. Find a trusted person to talk with about your challenges. Share with important people in your life the experiences you are struggling with and don't be afraid to open up conversation. Being open about your challenges can also allow other people the space to share their struggles.
Recruit Support
Finding a support system is important when we are struggling with anxiety. There are a variety of support resources available, both in-person options and online, that can be of great help. A community of people who not only understand but can offer tips and suggestions for helpful coping strategies can be valuable.
Laugh
Anxiety tends to rob us of joy and gets in the way of us being able to have fun. Remember to nurture your longing to have fun and laugh. You can find humor in books, on television, or online sources. Taking a moment to laugh and have fun can offer a gentle reminder that the anxiety is not in charge.
Emotional Coping Strategies
Try these strategies for coping with intrusive thoughts, constant worry or fear, feelings of uncertainty, apprehension, dread, or overwhelm.
Mindfulness
There are varied practices of mindfulness that can help with anxiety. Using techniques like mindfulness, prayer, and deep breathing can help slow down our anxious processing of thoughts and emotions. By slowing down we are learning to be more present rather than hyper-focused on trying to anticipate and prepare for the future, which is what anxiety makes us focus on, even when there are no threats present.
Learn Your Triggers
As you practice slowing down and becoming more mindful, it will be helpful for you to pay attention to the situations that seem to trigger your anxiety. Although it won't always be an option to avoid those triggers, being aware of them can help you gain clarity and take steps toward managing stress in those specific situations.
Learning cognitive ways to challenge your anxiety can help, such as diffusing anxious thoughts and calming the need to keep asking ""what if.""
Practice Acceptance
Remember that anxiety is not something you are experiencing because you are flawed in any way. Anxiety is influenced by a host of factors such as genetics, neurobiology, family history, and life experiences. There is no one cause of GAD and it is something that many people experience.
As impossible as it may seem, it can be helpful to learn to accept the journey and embrace it as an opportunity to learn and care for yourself in healthy ways. Accepting your emotions can Improve health Identifying the emotions is the Step to achieving this.
Keep a Positive Attitude
There is no need to lose hope for better living. Many people challenged with anxiety, such as with generalized anxiety disorder, lead full, productive, and joyful lives. The key is taking time to learn what strategies work well for you, stay connected to others, and remain positive.
Find inspiration through quotes, verses, music, nature, social connections, etc. We are surrounded by positive examples of hope and inspiration.
Practical Coping Strategies
Practical coping can ease physical symptoms like insomnia, digestive troubles, and more. They can help with emotional symptoms as well.
Eat Well
What we put into our bodies can influence how we feel physically and emotionally. Foods do not cause anxiety, but making good food choices can help us keep our mind and body healthy. Eating things like sugary snacks and processed foods can lead to quick highs and lows in our blood sugar that can influence feelings of restlessness and fatigue.
Exercise
Moving your body can be a great way to manage stress. Exercise helps to boost our endorphins and relieve tension. Try something new or go with an old favorite activity you enjoy. Any way that you choose to exercise will be of benefit.
Keep a consistent schedule and try to incorporate exercise three to four times per week or more. You may also try massage or Progressive muscle relaxation to help ease muscle tension that is often experienced with anxiety.
Get Enough Sleep
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), only 1 in 3 adults in the United States get the recommended seven hours of sleep at night. Although it can be difficult to sleep when we experience anxiety, creating a reliable nighttime routine can help us relax and prepare for quality sleep. Things like progressive relaxation, reading, and turning off electronics at least one hour before bed can help you prepare your mind and body for rest.
Breathing
Shortness of breath can be a common physical symptom of anxiety, along with a tightened chest and muscle tension. In those moments we often forget to breathe and take rapid, shallow breaths. Practicing how to take Slow abdominal breath can help.
A Word From Verywell
Things to keep in mind as you walk through your journey with generalized anxiety disorder is that you are not alone and you can live a full life. Although anxiety and worry may be an obstacle for you now, and even feel uncontrollable at times, there are resources, trained professionals, and coping techniques available to help. Learning how to navigate your triggers, reaching out for help, and keeping a positive attitude all help.
Taking care of yourself also involves talking with a professional who can put a Plan of treatment in place. Talking with a counselor or other mental health provider on a regular basis can be helpful as well, to know that someone understands your experience and can help you learn to effectively navigate challenges as they arise.

169,"Yes! Be in control of those emotions. Mindful meditation, simple breathing techniques, lots of practice. Medication makes it easier.If you struggle with addiction issues, practice will help. Dealing with this this takes commitment. You can control those thoughts that cause you to stress. Study mindfulness and breathing. Practice makes it easier. You be the boss. The harder you work the easier it gets.",GAD
170,"The right treatment can often improve GAD. You and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both.
Taking Medicine
Your provider may prescribe one or more medicines, including:
An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks or months to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD.
A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. However, benzodiazepines can become less effective and habit forming over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work.
When taking medicine for GAD:
Keep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead.
Do not change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider.
Take medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine.
Ask your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur.
Therapy
Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it.
Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often, CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:
Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.
Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.
Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.
Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.
Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.

172,"Anxiety is hard to take. I deal with anxiety all day. I also suffer from Panic Attacks. It is torture. But there’s both psychological and medical ways to deal with it.
The psychological way is to take deep breaths. Count to ten, hug your family or friends, or mate. It gives a little comfort. You really feel helpless, and you are in agony. It is so distressing; you cannot deal with an everyday chore.
There is also affirmations. You say things like, ‘in a little while, I’ll be riding my bike; in a little while I’ll read a book; In a little while I’m okay, honey,’ and believe it or not it gives you at least hope. It gives you strength.
Then there is the walking or screaming up to the top of your lungs. Cry if you must. It is okay, okay. Count, walk, hug, scream.
The psychiatric way is to take medicines like Risperdal (an anti-psychotic medicine that both is used in depression, and now anxiety.) There is also a medicine called Diphenhydramine HCL, and that’s used for both anxiety and dystonia.

174,"Hello. I have battled PTSD for over a decade now. It comes with depression and a dose of generalized anxiety disorder. I have attended counseling, tried numerous prescription plans, along with several other clinical treatments. They help; but, nothing has helped me more than meditation. The first thing ANYONE around you will tell you, “BREATHE” well, that is the basis of meditation. It takes a bit of time and practice, as meditation is a skill. When I began, I was having roughly three to four panic attacks a week. Years of counseling went by and I finally decided to try meditation. For the first week I thought it was the most ridiculous thing ever, but then around week three I noticed I was having less panic attacks. My mood improved and I had less depression. By around week eight of meditation, I began to notice the others around me began to be happier. I will swear by it.
I also began using medical marijuana. As some of my psychiatrists have stated, “it only masks the problem” but, sometimes when you’re in a pinch and don’t have time to sit down with meditation or what have you, you may give it a shot. As long as I control the usage and not abuse it, I seem to be able to function. Also, CBD oils.
I wish you the best! Blessed be.",GAD

178,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

179,"Here’s an average school day:
A.L = Anxiety Level, 0% being completely calm and 100% being anxiety attack.
6:45 AM - Wake up and hope that my legs aren't paralyzed from social anxiety. If so, I have to wait two to three hours for it to go away. [A.L: 30% normally, 50% if woke up from nightmare]
7:00 AM - Try to block out my mother’s and sister’s arguing to hurry up when both of them are on their computers/tablets, or when my sister refuses to get up and my mom has to get her dressed. Music with noise-canceling headphones usually do the trick.
7:30 AM - After telling me when she gets home later that afternoon and checking to see if my legs are paralyzed, mom takes my sister to school, I stay on the sofa listening to music.
10:40 AM - Nine times out of ten, my legs heal and I’m able to slowly walk around the house. I get dressed, wash up, and get out the door with my messenger bag by 10:45.
10:50 AM - Deep breaths as I walk the half mile to school, listening to music as I go down the sidewalk. Because my brain didn’t remind me about the medicine (sometimes even if I get a miracle and remember), every time a car passes by, one or more of the following thoughts goes through my head:
“Pedophile.”
“If the car pulls up beside you, run.”
“Please don’t get near me.”
“Don’t be a crazy person and try to run me over.” (Even though I’m on the sidewalk.)
“Just keep walking.”
11:00 AM - If I left correctly and paced myself correctly, I arrive at a ten-foot-long crosswalk that is at the entrance to the student parking lot. My school, like any high school, has a lot of rude teens. I stop at the crosswalk, look both ways and down the road to check for cars, and speed-walk to the other side while holding my breath as if I was trying to commit a crime. [
[Off chance I get there at 11:02 - Cars fill the entrance as each driver tries to get onto the main road. I can feel their judging eyes on me as I approach the crosswalk. I could feel their annoyances as they only want to go to lunch and don’t want to wait a second longer because some crazy walker girl decides to come to school at this exact time. I make my first step, making eye contact with the driver as my pace speeds up and I run to the other side. Although, if I wait long enough, someone else could be on the other side of the crosswalk. The pure blessed coincidence lets me know that it’s safe to cross without getting yelled at, as I’m not the only one crossing. I make it to the other side and take a deep breath. I survived.]
11:05 - I meet up with a couple friends and we chat and play around during lunch hour. It often starts with me going up to our second-floor meeting spot and me apologizing for being out of breath and tired. They both nod and say it’s okay, as both of them know about my anxiety. It’s only during this time when my defenses are lowered. [A.L: 20%, 40–70% if trigger passes by.]
12:03 - Bell rings, I say goodbye and go to my first class (everyone else’s fifth class). I happen to have something called “Office Aide”, where I get to help out the administrators in the discipline office. For me, it’s a social exercise. Whenever I’m not called to do something, I hang out in the staff lounge and listen to music (bonus points if I’m the only one there, excluding the occasional admin or two). Occasionally I get to deliver papers from one office to another, or manage the printer for a teacher who needs copies.
However, there is one activity that is the most common, and by far what I hate the most: Pass delivery. Which requires organizing the passes from nearest to farthest away, mentally highlighting the fifth period classes for each student, and checking every ten seconds to make sure they are in correct order and I didn't make any mistake. Then it’s opening the door and having 20–23 pairs of eyes following my every step and action, while I have to keep my eyes on the teacher, who I just interrupted their lesson with something from the office. As soon as I give the teacher the pass(es) and explain what they’re for in short sentences, I do a 180 u-turn and bolt right through the door. Once I get through, I take a breather and go on to the next classroom. Repeat as needed.
The next couple classes are easier. The teachers know I have GAD and give me permission to listen to concentration music to block out all the other background noises from other classmates.
After school, I meet up with my friends again, chat, and then head home. Repeat 11:02 behavior except everyone wants to go home and are even more reckless. Honking makes me jump and bolt to the other side, only crossing the crosswalk when others are crossing at the same time as me.
Same paranoia with walking home as in the morning.
3:00 PM - I unlock the house door and collapse on the sofa after taking off my bag and changing out of my collared-shirt uniform to something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m being lightly choked. Start slow work on writing and homework, as well as completing all necessary assignments for online classes-
5:00 PM - A weird taste gets in my mouth as I wake up from accidentally passing out and having no memory how I got to the sofa or how I managed to fall asleep. Realize the time and panic for a little that I only have 30 minutes before mom and sister come home.
5:30 PM - Chaos ensues. Katie starts shouting and pulling my very-tired mother to go play with her on Minecraft or Roblox, not caring that she’s been working a min-paying job for seven hours. I have no-where to go to escape. My mom retreats to her room to nap, while my sister puts on her earphones and shouts for mom to go to her. I end up being the middle-man and play messenger until I remind mom that she’s a mother. I put on my headphones and lower my 70% anxiety with more music and watching videos.
This continues until my grandmother likely comes over and I have to hide, least a panic attack would be triggered and I’d be punished by her for not fully calming down in 15 minutes and that I’m “crazy”. (She’s no help is my point.)
10:00 PM - House is blissful. Mom and sister are asleep, I’m on the sofa again either typing stories, reading and answering Quora questions/articles, playing Sims 4, or researching psychology.
4:00 AM - Insomnia holds me hostage. I have stared at the ceiling for hours. Every little sound I hear wakes me up like a monster is trying to get into the house. I have a light on in the living room to keep me out of the dark and so I have full sight of my immediate surroundings. AC unit kicks in every once in a while, my mind often mistaking it as some madman trying to invade the house by going through the vents, same with creaking of the door or leaves bouncing along the ground outside by the wind.
This repeats every day. It changes very little during weekends and school breaks; Everything around me is terrifying, leaves scare me, people remind me that I don’t belong in this world, and my family is just another obstacle for me to overcome along with my anxiety. I write a lot as a result; writing is my escape path. I wish I can write more, but I don’t want to annoy you with long things to read. ^_^
That’s my daily life with anxiety. I have my good and bad days, and every day is very draining. My family tell me to be more social, that I should be this or that like what other teenage girls do. I ignore all that crap and focus on taking care of myself and know where my limits lie. I have GAD because of my surroundings, but now I try not to let my surroundings summon what it created.

As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
181,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
182,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
183,"It is pretty much cured now for all intents and purposes, as long as practice EGMi to keep my left brain logical/positive thought and feeling high with very little right brain anxious/negative thought and feeling.
If it even begins to start up I just boost left brain use and it goes away, life is much more blissful now with no worry about anything.",GAD
184,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

185,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
186,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
187,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
188,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
189,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder

Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy

190,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
191,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
192,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
193,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD

Hyperventilating in stressful situations
Facial twitches
Being so tense in my sleep that I’d pull muscles

Things I didn’t realize until adulthood because to me, it never existed (if you don’t realise these are possible, maybe you should see a therapist):
You can think about nothing.
You can relax and enjoy the moment.
You can make it days without holding tension. (I physically feel lighter without anxiety).
People wake up NOT feeling nervous, and can make it whole days without feeling like ninjas are going to bust out of a closet and attack.
Luckily for me, I have been using neurofeedback for about 5 weeks now, and it has opened my eyes to how life actually is.",GAD
195,"I don’t ever like to say that my anxiety is severe, because I always know that people have it worse than I do. I’m able to function enough to go to my job, and come home without having panic attacks or other severe symptoms.
Although it’s not severe, it’s still pretty debilitating.
it started in early middle school for me. I never ate lunch at school from 6th grade to 10th grade, I would usually pick off friends plates if they had extra, but normally I just waited until I got home to eat dinner. It was the usual shitty things running through my head that made me not want to eat,
“Are they staring at me?”
“Do I have something on my face?”
“Do I eat weird and are they laughing at me?”
and when all I could do was think about those questions, I would get hot and sweaty and turn bright red. ( I’m 50% ginger, so my complexion is very pale/pink, so if I turn red-you’ll notice)—another reason why I avoided eating and other things that made me anxious because people would KNOW when I was embarrassed.
And then I was plagued, like most of us, with a hard time doing oral presentations. I would get hot, sweaty, bright red, I would stutter on my words and go in circles with what I was trying to say and whenever I’m really anxious, my vocabulary gets pretty limited and I never know what I’m saying or how to say it. In high school- I was more ept on getting out of presentations. However, in my civics class, senior year I think it was, we had to have a “debate” before it was my turn, I got so sick that I vomited all over a bathroom stall by accident.
When I was 10, I was prescribed glasses to help me see far away. By the end of 5th grade, the chalkboard started to get fuzzy and I was unable to see what the teacher was writing. When I got them, I thought they were so cool! But entering 6th grade, they were certainly NOT cool. As a socially anxious child, I sat in the back, where no one could laugh at me, and this negatively affected my grades because I couldn’t see what the teacher was writing on the board or presentations. In my 9th grade history class, I made the conscious decision to tell my teacher I needed to sit in the front of the class so I was able to see the board- this was one of the worst mistakes I probably had ever made. The people behind me had formed a clique, so they talked and laughed a lot. So poor me, always thought it was directed at me. I always left that class a sweaty mess!
Speaking of sweaty mess—that what my main symptom. I couldn’t wear t-shirts because I was always sweating right through them. So during my middle school years and partially high school years, I only wore hoodies and zip-up jackets in dark colors year round, so even if I did sweat through it, you couldn’t really see it. Well, wearing a sweatshirt in summertime, even if it reached 90° out, was definitely something people had questions about.
In 10th grade is when I was finally put on a concoction of meds to help me deal with the cards I had been dealt, and it was great. I started to eat lunch at school, and I started wearing my glasses when I needed them. Although, I still had huge issues with presentations, (remember 12th grade civics class), which I don’t think I’ll ever overcome that. And one of the best things, I stopped sweating profusely, so much that I was able to completely change my wardrobe.
Now, as a young adult (24), I’m not currently on medication and I live my life in a pretty limited way. I refuse to go out to new restaurants, and the answer is an extra no when there’s new people involved. I pretty much hate going out to dinner with people unless you’re my family, fiancé, or old friends from high school and that’s only 3 people. I don’t get my own gas, I have a hard time talking to customers at my job, and I have come out of the grocery store in tears especially when it’s busy because it’s too stressful for me. However, I’m thankful that I’m able to leave the house (for the most part), and that it isn’t any worse than it is. And although thankful, I still hate that I struggle with simple things that most people are able to do on a daily basis.",GAD
196,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD

198,"It sounds like you are anxious due to the work environment... which, frankly, sounds like a tough work environment that would make most people anxious - especially when they're new at it. You're not alone.
I remember feeling the same way when I started a professional job in my early 30s. I was intelligent, hard working, competent... but completely out of my element. After several weeks of feeling completely lost, I ended up at my doctor's office with chest pains and piercing headaches. He said ""anxiety"" but he didn't prescribe anything. He told me to breathe (probably good advice) and to know that it would pass. Maybe he should have drugged the snot out of me... but I don't think that would have helped me learn the new job, so in hindsight I'm glad he didn't.
In complete fear that I was failing miserably, I went to my boss. I told him that I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to learn the new job. He smiled and told me not to worry (easier said than done, right?). He told me that they hired me because I was outgoing, bright, and capable... they knew that the rest would come. And it did. I stayed with that company for more than 10 years and became one of their more knowledgable and valuable staff members. I made a lot of money and I made a huge group of great friends.
Sometimes we think we're worse than we are. We focus on negative feedback from others and we use our relentless inner voice to amplify the critical things that others say. It's important to recognize that you're learning a new job - a new skill - and it is something that takes time. Keep doing your best - that's what YOU can control. If you aren't cut out for this work or it isn't a good fit, then you'll have learned a valuable lesson at age 16. Maybe the fast-paced restaurant environment isn't a good fit for you. Or maybe you're going to suddenly catch on and this could be the weekend that things get better. Either way, learn from life. Don't beat yourself up. There's not some strange thing wrong with you that makes you somehow worse than others. Your young... and you're learning and finding your strengths. Ask your manager (not your co-workers) for a chance to talk and get some feedback on your performance. Do this at a time when things aren't busy. Let the manager know that you want to know HOW you can improve - not just ""go faster"" but some tips for how you can do that. Maybe there's a trick that everyone knows and they assume that you do too. Get the honest feedback and learn, learn, learn, learn.
The worst thing you can do is give up on yourself. Even if you give up on the job, you must do it as a learning experience - because then there is never any failure. If you continue to feel this way and the unfortunate feedback continues, go find a different job. It's part of learning what you enjoy. It's hard when you're young but it isn't impossible and you've probably gained some valuable experience in the short time you've been there.
I'm very impressed that you even posted this question. It shows that you're interested in improving yourself. That in itself puts you ahead of many, many others your age. Good for you.
Hang in there! Good luck!",GAD
199,"Anxiety is more than just being nervous. I have had anxiety since 4th grade and like any other person I was told that it's just nervousness and nothing serious. As I grew up I started having severe problems and that's when I consulted a doctor. You can look for the following signs:
NAUSEOUS: One of the common symptoms is nausea. You will loss appetite and might feeling nauseous.
Tummy issues: Anxiety is directly related to gut health. If you have frequent gastric issues or digestion issues there is a possibility that these are triggered by anxiety.
Palpitations: everybody feels anxious upto a certain extent and they might experience a racing heart beat during tensed situations. But if you experience palpitations even when there is no certain reason, it's a sign.

200,"An anxiety disorder is a label that is there for diagnostic and legal purposes. Your subjective experience of anxiety is valid, regardless. Fear is a very innate and natural response, but it may become a concern if it is about an object/event which is spatially or temporally distal. This means that you're worried about something that will not immediately affect you. This worry may be constant, excessive, and most importantly impairing.
When we are anxious we may feel tense, worried, breathless, may have sweaty palms and a pounding heart. It is an intense emotion when most of us may feel uneasy, apprehensive and/or nervous and experience some degree of muscle tension. It feels like we are afraid, but we can't identify any reason (s) for our fear and uneasiness. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress.
However one could be experiencing an anxiety disorder if the anxiety or fear is
Out of proportion to the situation or age
Out of the control of the individual
Hinder’s one’s ability to function effectively
Causes you to consistently avoid the situation, event, and/or task altogether
If you are experiencing anxiety then chances are that you will be able to overcome the feeling and function effectively at work and around family and friends
There are different kinds of anxiety disorders with their own set of physical and emotional symptoms. These must last for a specific period of time and should significantly disturb one’s work life, personal life, relationships and general well-being for one to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.
Here is a list of a few of the most common types of anxiety disorders with their identifying characteristics. These have been given by the American Psychological Association, a universally accepted body for the diagnosis and treatment of mental health concerns.

201,"A really good book around this topic is the Myth of Mental Illness by Thomas Szasz. He was a Hungarian psychiatrist and the above book is potentially the most cited critique on modern psychology. He suggests that what we may be experiencing now is not an abundance of psychological disorders, but rather, improper routines. When it comes to anxiety, there are multiple daily habits that can provoke anxious feelings.
The first question I would ask is are you maintaining a consistent sleep schedule? In regards to sleep, it is crucial that you at the very least, wake up at the same time each day. By having an irregular sleep schedule, you throw off your circadian rhythm. This is the 24-hour cycle that is part of the body's internal clock, running in the background to carry out essential functions and processes. Tell-tale signs of an irregular circadian rhythm include decreased alertness and difficulty concentrating, impaired judgment and trouble controlling mood and emotions, as well as anxiety. By going to bed and wake up at regular times (what the times are, does not matter), you set your internal workings on track and establish some form of a routine.
Another question I would ask is are you eating enough? One should try to get at least 2000 calories each day as this is the minimum amount to keep you going. Your body burns a lot of energy throughout the day, so it is essential to ensure you eat enough to keep you fueled. Anxiety is a direct symptom of having an improper diet. As an experiment, next time you feel slightly anxious, eat a chocolate bar. You should notice that your anxiety either decreases or disappears entirely. I’m not saying that you should only eat a chocolate bar when you are anxious, but if it works, an improper diet would be confirmed.
Lastly, I would ask how much time you are spending on your phone and on social media. Cell phones are a relatively new development, and their long term effects are mostly unknown. However, there are multiple studies that link anxiety with prolonged cell phone use. After all, social media platforms are very stressful. After a while, this can stress your brain and it can exhibit this stress as anxiety.
I would recommend that you try, at the minimum, to make adjustments to these three things. Make an experiment for yourself. A lot 10 to 14 days where you create a strict regiment of a regular sleep schedule, proper diet, and decreased phone usage. If you see drastic improvements, you have your solution. However, if these do not work, there are a plethora of studies available for you to read. There may be some other factors that I did not include. If you find something that you find may work for you, add it to the regiment.

202,"Everyone has general anxiety which is necessary for day to day life
Some people have social anxiety which varies person to person
Some people are more confident so they have least or no anxiety
Anxiety is something that triggers body parts when you think something negative or any negative situation comes to you ever in life just like this pandemic which caused many people both general anxiety and panic attack
If these symptoms exceed the limit so you may have either one of any psychological problem or any fear inside just to consult psychologist the only solution and life awareness play an other important role to cope with such problems that's what did during my depression period",GAD
203,"You should speak to your guidance counsellor or your pastor or another adult you trust. Your friends are a-holes. Sometimes parents don’t want to deal with the fact that something might be wrong with their child. My mother is still like that. She denies everything I tell her so I stopped telling her. Of course, I am old enough that I can get help without her. I suffer from anxiety and you certainly share some of the symptoms I have/have had. I encourage you to speak to someone. I know it may be difficult but going through life the way you describe it is much worse. Maybe there is a teacher that you are fond of. Take care.",GAD
204,"It’s something you can’t really miss. If it’s you who has it, it might happen more than once and it’s oddly noticeable by how you’re acting, and especially feeling.
I have been feeling severe anxiety ever since I was just a kid. But every person has a different kind of anxiety. There is a similar symptom sometimes and that is you do not know what you have to fear, yet you do until you feel like it almost kills you (yes, physically: rapid heart beat and breathing, sometimes I would overthink and pray I don’t die). Having anxiety means even just talking or hearing about anxiety might give you anxiety.
I’m lucky that I can talk about this because I’ve left this illness back to my childhood. But it’s still there, I know it because I feel it sometimes, although now I know how to control it.
OCD on the other hand sticks out like a sore thumb. You can’t, physically—can’t avoid it.

206,"I think that is a question you need to answer for yourself. To be diagnosed with an actual disorder you will have to seek help? At least see a qualified therapist that can make that diagnosis. To answer in a common sense way, I think it depends on the degree of your anxiety. If you feel your anxiety is effecting or hindering your life substantially, then I would say yes, seek help. You also have to decide where to seek help. Are you ok being prescribed medicine for it? I try to avoid medicine and have had good luck learning meditation and mental and emotional management practice. Keeping balance and knowing when to say no to people and things. I do have medicine that I can take if all else fails. But as I have become better with managing myself I use the medicine less and less. I think I have used it 3–4 times this year. I never wanted to take a daily medicine for my diagnosed anxiety. I agreed to “as needed” medicine and worked on learning to manage it myself. Hope that helps, good luck.

207,"Sounds like you have a anxiety disorder. Speaking to a mental health professional will be helpful on giving you the proper diagnosis as well as meditation if they think it’s necessary.
What you can try
Breathing
Close your eyes. Breathe through your nose so if you have a straw it goes right down to your stomach and suck up all your tension. Hold for about 5 seconds, exhale through your mouth like your blowing up a balloon. Do this 10x. When you start feeling really relaxed, press your finger and thumb together.
Meditation - this helps your stress levels to calm down as well as enhancing brain function and increases self control.
Dancing, walking, jogging - This helps to counteract stress as your heart rate increases, the brain starts releasing endorphins, stress levels start to decrease and the chemicals built up by the stress and anxiety are pushed out of your system.
Get enough sleep, let your body calm down and repair its self
Yoga and Tai Chi - similar to the breathing exercise. It increases relaxation which counteracts stress. Also makes you feel balanced.
Eat some bananas (2 bananas at least an hour before public speaking), eat some plain dark chocolate,
Avoid sugar and anything containing caffeine (includeds tea, energy drinks, soft drinks and decaf. These will increase your anxiety symptoms.
Still bottled water or tap. You need to stay hydrated.
Take a warm relaxing bath with lavender scented oils
Pet your dog or cat. Listen to soothing music. Sing along if you want.
Plenty of fruit and vegetables.
You are not being crazy or dramatic. Anxiety happens to 40 million adults in the United States alone and it is highly treatable.
It’s not something funny, it’s not something that you can just work through with exercise only. Just being appreciative about things isn’t going to work by its self.
Anxiety happens to people living on the street as well as high paid famous actors and singers. Anxiety doesn’t discriminate.
Nobody has the right to make you feel bad about yourself or kick you when your down, lost and scared.
I really hope this answers your question and it helps you.

208,"I'd really caution against self-diagnosis or really diagnosis and pathologization of any kind. I don't think that it does much but gives the doctors work. Now, some anxiolytics can be helpful. I used Buspar for a year or so.
When this kind of thing happens, I suspect something I call a watchdog. That's a part of the brain that has been trained in some way to react to a particular situation, usually with something bad, such as intense anxiety or a sense of hopelessness. Of course, we learn this way, but sometimes what we learn becomes dysfunctional.
It becomes an automatic response. When I learned to do a stick shift, I had to learn when to push the clutch and think about it. Then after a bit, I no longer did. However, when I drove an automatic transmission, I had to stop that part of my brain from working, or else it would make me hit the brake with my left foot. This was exciting, a bit more than I cared for.
I learned how to deal with these watchdogs. The basic way I used was to talk to them, mostly in dreams. One big watchdog that made me shy finally, after some work, played me a movie of something that happened to me between second and third grade. Funny thing is that it wasn't a ""repressed memory"" or anything like that. It was something I remembered, but my adult brain didn't consider it traumatic. However, a part of my child's brain had, and it left effects that lasted until my 30s. So I reassured that part of my brain that I really didn't have to fear those things, and that solved it.
I recommend it to you. It works.",GAD
209,"Yes, indeed, that is anxiety. This does not necessarily mean it is doing you any harm though. Anxiety can form a negative self fulfilling spiral, so step 1.. RELAX.
Learning to cope with pressure at some level is a good thing. Try to be philosophical about it. You can only work as fast as you can [though probably faster if you weren't burning up mental energy stressing] If you do your best and its not good enough for what they need in their fast paced business, they will replace you when they can. You might as well go and earn money till they decide that. Just rock up and do your best, the worst that will actually happen is that they will sack you. It wont surprise you if it works out that way. You don't need to take it personally. They are probably waiting to see how you get the hang of it with more practice.
Seeing a doctor about anxiety in a particular workplace like that seems premature unless it it actually impacting badly on other areas of your life. Just because you are not cut out for furious paced cafe work [which I have done] doesn't mean you are useless. Its a job, so you go and do your job as best you can, get paid, come home and don't worry about it.
There a techniques for practicing being calm that you can find plenty of stuff about. There is a general principle though ""fake it till you become it"" Imagine adopting the attitude, calm mental state, and state of body posture and motion that would make you awesome at that job. relax breath deeply and normally, smile a little and get on with it. Don't feel like a victim. EVER!
This job does not sound like a situation that you will be keeping for a long time, so get better at it while you are there, and get paid.
Nobody smart is going to recommend to a 16 year old quitting a job. If you want different work, find it WHILE YOU STILL HAVE A JOB. It is much easier, to rock up to an interview saying ""My current job doesn't really suit me"" with them knowing you turn up for work anyway, rather than ""I quit my last job, it was too stressful"" Who would you employ?
Hope that helps",GAD
210,"Listen dude, your problems are not 'you' they're the combination of 'you&this work environment' (work environment largely meaning the people you work with). Maybe to some degree they feel threatened that someone so young is doing the same job as them for likely less pay. Maybe subconsciously they are giving you a hard time so that you will leave....
One way to combat this is to think about - if you didn't have this job what are the consequences? Do you NEED the money? If you don't then think about it this way - if you get fired, so what? You worked in a job with jerks who didn't help you get good at the job and you got fired. Life experience. Next job. In fact start searching for a new job whilst you still have this one, you're more important to a potential employer if you tell them, currently I'm working at this place but I don't like it for the following reasons(be clever with what you say) and I want to work at your company because I like the kind of work/work environment you offer, please can I work here? (Its kind of how girls find you a bit more attractive when you already have a girlfriend)
I know that at the moment in your life everything is about success and being good at everything , but experiencing failure and understanding that failure can lead to positive change is something you need to learn. At the moment everything is about exams and getting a job and having money and trying to be king of the world (or so you are told all the time) but not being great at some crap job in a bar isn't something you should be worrying about so much.
The attitude: yeah, I failed at something -so what?
Is a good one to be able to live with (obviously don't think that failing at EVERYTHING in life is ok) you need a few successes ;)
The reason you are worrying is because the people you work with are making you worry. They're not intelligent enough to understand the long term mental health issues that can be inflicted to a young person when subjected to so much stress and pressure whilst theyre still developing and don't have the experience & coping skills that some older people have (and they don't take into account that you have additional stress when you go home because of exams etc).
Okay so, you can write a letter to the manager of the business, outlining what you said on this quora question(your description) and make sure you say everything you need to in it. Just give it to the manager directly. Don't blame any individuals in what you say, just say its an overall thing.
If it doesn't cause a change then move on to a new job. Watch out for your stress and anxiety levels , use your own intellect to decide whether dealing with the stress is worth it and be proactive at reducing it. Find a new job if you have to.
A bit of stress and anxiety are OK because they kick us into gear, otherwise without a worry in the world people would just be lying around all the time, eating, sleeping, having sex etc

211,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
212,"My adolescence was shadowed by chronic anxiety and depression, a constant weight that grew heavier with each passing day.
My anxiety eventually morphed into a phobia that prevented me from taking my B.Sc. exam for two consecutive years.
Fear, insecurity, and despair engulfed me. Confidence seemed a distant dream; hopelessness held me captive. My thoughts were plagued by the belief that I could achieve nothing. Severe anxiety and depression became my constant companions, manifesting as IBS, excessive sweating, tremors, palpitations, nightmares, and overwhelming worry and a feeling of impending doom.
Concerned about my well-being, my parents took me to see a psychiatrist. The doctor initiated treatment with medication and recommended psychotherapy. The years of consistent psychotherapy sessions were instrumental in rebuilding my lost confidence.
As therapy progressed, my medication dosage gradually decreased.
While psychotherapy ultimately played a pivotal role in my recovery, confronting reality was equally crucial. Therapy equipped me with the tools and self-awareness necessary to face my challenges head-on. I refused to succumb to despair, persistently pushing forward to break free from its grip.
The efforts paid off. Recovery arrived, bringing with it a job, marriage, and a newfound understanding: depression is treatable, and suicide is never the answer. Seeking help, at any cost, is the path towards a fuller, happier life.
There's nothing more precious than life itself. I am currently sharing my experiences and the knowledge I've gained by learning from and working with a network of doctors, therapists, caregivers, and experts in the fields of clinical psychology, psychiatry, and related fields, through my blog, LiveWellTalk .com

I couldn't sleep. I hated my job and myself and I kept making simple mistakes, thinking it was because I was dumb. I now work in a similar workplace with higher end food, I was afraid of making mistakes like at the other place, for example the old Chef yelled at me for breaking three eggs in a row. I was on edge and I of course broke an egg and my new job. I waited for the chef to flip his lid but instead of hovering over me he just kind of ignored it and waited for me to start over. I now rarely break an egg (like one in twenty and usually they are all ready poor quality) and I am happy!

There is a fine line between anxiety and anxiety disorder, which you have to look after. Sometimes people get anxious before giving an exam or for a job interview. But if you're going through anxiety disorder, then you will face a constant feeling of irritation and restlessness for a long period. You will get racing and unwanted thoughts, leading to insomnia or palpitations. When a kid goes through anxiety, they lack concentration while studying or doing any activity. I know all these symptoms well because last year, I went to anxiety disorder, and I frequently used to worry and fear little things in life.

1. Common Anxiety: Which occurs to mostly every human being the anxiety we feel a day before our exam are common anxiety.
2. Anxiety Disorder: According to research one in every fourteen person are affected by this disorder, being an anxious person includes thinking deep even for very irrelevant things which sounds like overthinking but overthinking is just one symptom of Anxiety Disorder .

I’m also concerned that you’re referring to people who laugh at your suffering as “friends.” Those people are not worthy of calling themselves your friends and I’m really sorry if you don’t have anyone nicer in your life right now.
Definitely see your guidance counselor, and if at all possible, ask a psychologist for help with this. These symptoms are very treatable in most cases, but it’s tough and can’t be done without some support by people who understand. This is extra important for you if your family is struggling to understand as well. They may change their minds when they learn more about it, or they may not.

Some people do inner work where they shift their fear energy to being open to whatever the outcome may be.

220,"How do I even start?
Ok, so being an INFJ with ADHD is a really REALLY interesting combo for better or worse. Right now I’m a college student and oh my gosh it can be hard to concentrate. It’s not that I don’t want to or I’m not trying to, my brain literally won’t cooperate sometimes. I have a really big desire to make a difference in a lot of peoples lives. Not for fame or money or recognition, but because I genuinely want to help people. A lot of times not being able to finish the things I start or getting side tracked, or forgetting to do things that are important and really matter can be insanely frustrating. Also getting in homework on time is a nightmare. I have really good professors and I’ve talked to them about it, so they give me some leeway, but it’s still difficult.
Being a deep thinker who’s constantly in your head mixed with your brain constantly going at a million miles an hour (switching from one topic to the next faster than most people can keep up with) can be confusing as heck, though sometimes it’s really quite fun. Oh the stories I’ve made up in my head! It gets really cool, I’ve combined stories from books, games, movies, and shows I’ve watched with characters from different things or ones I made up. I have an expanded universe in my head. If I want to get really immersed I combine that with listening to movie soundtracks. I make up stories in real time with the music and it just goes so well. To an outside observer when I do this I’m just staring off into space while pacing with headphones on, but inside I’m saving the world in an ancient in an underground aztec city from this one guy (originally one of the antagonists from Michael Vey book series, but I’ve developed his character quite a bit and now he’s somewhat of an anti-hero).
Needless to say, I’m in my head a lot.
I can visualize literally anything. (great for architecture and engineering ;) So all I need is one thing to remind me of something really cool and interesting and I get shot off into space and I’m a million miles away, then someone starts saying my name to get me sucked back into reality and I realize they just asked me a question and I have no Idea what they said, but I want to answer it so I try to just go from context clues and just pretend to answer until I finally realize what they asked in a way that they can’t tell I wasn’t listening to a word they said.
That being said when I am paying attention I’m a really good listener.
It’s easy (from what other people say) to trust me. Especially when someones going through a hard time and need someone to talk to. It’s really easy for me to be that person. (Yeah classic INFJ, being everyones therapist) I think the reason I’m like that is because when I’m going through that kind of stuff, theres hardly ever anyone there who I can go to. It’s so easy for me to understand what other people are going through, but it seems like no one understands me and what I’m going through. It really sucks sometimes. I’ve tried to explain it to people before, but most people I’ve talked to never seem to get me. One of the few people who do is my Mom. I would be lost without her. She is the kindest, most patient and understanding person I know. And I’m not just saying that because she’s my Mom, other people think so too. I am so lucky to have someone like her that can help me try to untangle the tangled ball of flashing Christmas lights that is my brain.
For other people who are dealing with the same thing (rare as it may be, I’ve never met another INFJ, let alone one with ADHD - did the math, at most it’s 0.007% of people are like this) find someone like that. I know it’s hard and you over think things. But it really helps to not feel so alone. And trust me, I know the depths of loneliness that you can feel. Even surrounded by people, even those who care about you, you can feel hopelessly, completely alone. I know how much you care, and how deeply people can hurt you. I know how hard it is to get things done. Even when you want to and it’s important. Get some systems in place that can help you get through what your mind doesn’t always want to do. I found that bullet journaling and some other systems have done wonders. I have probably the most severe ADHD of anyone I have ever met (I’m guessing being ADHD and an INFJ just intensifies aspects of both) and I haven’t ever been clinically treated. So far I’ve just been going it alone. I think I might go talk to a doctor about it and see what they suggest.
Side note, there’s so much about me and the way I think I haven’t talked about. I am extremely impulsive (even by ADHD standards). Not like saying whatever pops into my head (which admittedly does happen) but like going on spontaneous adventures. I’ve moved around a lot (19 times in 7 different states and 2 countries — moving sucks) but I lived the longest in southern Utah about 15 minutes outside of Zion National Park. So spontaneous trips hiking, rock climbing, canyoneering, sand dune trips, or just heading up into the mountains happened quite frequently. I really feel at peace just being in nature. Some times when I’m in my head if I imagine something really sad or touching it can make me cry, then I remember that there’s people around me and I end up trying not to cry for no reason. (yeah! honesty! Don’t Judge) One of the symptoms of ADHD is actually emotional instability. Emotions are stronger and harder to control, so relationships can be tricky. When you open up to someone (which is hard for INFJ’s) and they reject you or hurt you, it hurts so bad. It is torment and it can last weeks and leave us with sleepless nights and it just sucks. (basically a break up dialed up to 12. or like 15)

It’s hard.
It’s like trying to fit in. Which . . . I’m not good at anyway.

And then ADHD made its first annoyance.
I started failing English.
Now, English is my best subject. Always had been. I just couldn’t pay attention.
So, a lonely INFJ who’s failing in her best subject?
That’s what led me to depression.
Let’s not add in that in addition to being an INFJ with ADHD, I also have Generalized and Social Anxiety disorders.
This combination . . . wow.

222,"Growing up I felt isolated and misunderstood by everyone including my family. I pictured myself looking through one of those nursery window in a hospital where the babies are on one side and the visitor are on the other. Except the world, my friends and family are living on the beautiful nursery side and I’m isolated living on the other side.
It’s hard to explain but I’ve always felt different. It was difficult for me to bring it up but I told my PCP that something was wrong with my brain at one point. He blew it off and told me I was fine. In college I tried talking to someone because I knew my brain worked differently than everyone. I thought something was wrong with me. I felt I was a puzzle piece that didn’t fit even though I was surrounded by an awesome social network. I’ll try to summarize how I feel: my brain never rests, it’s like 30 ping-pong balls bouncing around in my head. I’m hypersensitive to people or events, extremely emotional charged and it’s extremely difficult to stay focus or stay in the present. I feel like I’m a walking contradiction an imposter and I’m a magnet- absorbing others negative energy. I’m always in my head and I can’t get out. 9 yrs ago I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I thought finally they found out what’s wrong with my brain. I’m just having small electrical storms in my brain but that wasn’t the answer/solution I was looking for. I convinced my neurologist to refer me for a Neuropsych evaluation were I was diagnosed with ADHD. Ok, that explains a lot. My brain is hyperactive but it doesn’t explain exchange of energy I feel between the people I come in contact with. Just recently I took the MBTI and I’m an INFJ. I don’t know how to interpret the combination of ADHD and INFJ but I’ve really struggled my whole life trying to keep the peace within myself. Since learning about the INFJ personality type I’ve been able to reflect and give myself a break when I start to get overwhelm. When I start to get emotional I’ll take a quick inventory to determine if the emotions I’m feeling are mine or something I’m perceiving.
I’ve felt so broken for so long I wonder how ADHD plays into the big picture.",GAD
223,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
224,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

227,"I’m speaking from a time in my past when my anxiety was really bad (my late twenties):
1.) A tendency to isolate and ruminate. To deal with this, I had to learn to get out of my head and find healthy, positive ways of distracting myself. This could be as simple as taking a walk, getting myself my favorite chocolate, or getting on public transport and letting it take me wherever. The more stimuli around me, the higher chances of looking and feeling beyond what was taking up a majority of my mental battery.
2.) A tendency towards silence, and when forced to interact, lashing out. To deal with this, I had to learn to recognize when the behavior manifested and to practice self-awareness. I had to remind myself to not let the feelings become me. This took a very long time, mind you.
3.) A tendency to overthink and be highly self-critical. To deal with this, I had a lot of growing up to do. I had to get past my twenties and learn that it was okay to not meet my own goals or the standards I had so rigorously set for myself. I had to learn that it was okay to change.
4.) A tendency toward self-sabotage, a form of emotional self harm, as a form of punishing myself for not being enough, for being a “failure.” To deal with this, I had to learn to be kinder to myself. I had to learn to stop drinking coffee despite loving the taste because sleep and being calm were much more important. I had to learn to stop letting myself sleep so late despite being a night own because lack of sleep or poor quality of sleep could alter my mood, my ability to focus, and even my digestion (I was eating much more when I was tired). I had to learn to lessen my sugar intake so that I wouldn’t get so irritable when the crashes happened. I had to learn self restraint, and to be at peace with it. I had to understand that not having control is not necessarily a bad thing; I can prepare all I want, but things just tend to go wrong, such is life. I had to learn to be okay with being more flexible. I had to learn that to support myself, I had to be a person that I could try and rely on to do the right thing, especially when circumstances were difficult/tempting/triggering.
5.) A tendency to feed my feelings. To deal with this, I had to learn to stop engaging with my feelings and letting them overcome me, e.g. by indulging in depressing music or fiction or movies when I was in that sort of headspace, etc. While I connected with a lot of the themes seen in works that explored mental health (it made me feel like things could make sense), I realized that exposing myself to these things sometimes dug into my spirit and made the wounds, the ache, even deeper. I had to learn to be cognizant of my moods and stay away from material that could possibly aggravate my pain. I had to teach myself to breathe again, I had to want to breathe and not let the anxiety take over. I had to remind myself to breathe when I thought I couldn’t; I found out that I could.
6.) A tendency towards impulsivity. To deal with this, I had to give myself the permission to explore, to do things that I believed would rid myself of the intense fear and apprehension I was feeling: I would let myself travel all over the city, I would let myself read about anxiety (and depression) in the public library, I would treat myself to a nice meal, I would splurge and buy a few books (despite not having the right budget to do so), I would take a bus to the next city and see how a friend was doing without really calling ahead of time (just because). When I felt like I had given myself what I wanted, I would allow myself to analyze if the things that I did truly were necessary and helpful. I learned that when you have a benchmark and a better understanding of the things capable of helping you during a particular situation, you’re also able to realize the things/behaviors/actions that don’t benefit you at all. At the right time, you’re able to talk yourself down from acting on what you feel you want and what you think it can give you (e.g. that it will ease your pain/discomfort, even when there is no factual basis). I was able to make myself understand that while impulses can make life exciting, I need to think them through before acting on them.
7.) A tendency to feel less than human. To deal with this, I had to remind myself that I was loved and had every right to be loved, especially on the worst of days. I had to learn to be patient with myself. I had to learn to stop and challenge negative self-talk. I had to give myself the opportunity to feel human, e.g. I made an effort to have my hair cut, I took long, hot baths and used a lot of conditioner and some fancy castile soap (the effort reinforced feelings that I was worth it), I put a few drops of peppermint oil into a towel, covered my eyes and nose, let myself breathe deep, and encouraged myself to unwind and let my muscles loosen. In times when I felt overwhelmed, I let myself breakdown in the bathroom. I also made sure to wipe my own tears much later. I learned to pat myself on the back. I learned not to trust too much in what people say or let their perception diminish and alter my narrative. I learned to let myself accept the mistakes that I made. I allowed myself to accept that I was human.
I am not sure how this can be of help, but the message that I want to leave INFJs like myself with is that please try and be a little kinder to yourself. I am only sharing this from my perspective. Please do not take my experience as the rule or something that you should follow, this is just me thinking out loud and looking back on a chapter in my life. Take care, everyone.",GAD

Constantly studying human behavior, a MBTI / cognitive functions geek.

Feel myself adapting to people during conversations, figuring out who they are by what they don’t say. Feel like a chameleon, but also know who I am - just don’t feel the need to push my personality on anyone.
Can’t help reading body language and micro expressions, live for that actually.
Crave organization and structure but am not totally organized (yet) haha!
Feel everything, notice everything, very empathetic.
Emotional on the inside. Great actor, easy to hide feelings. Can be good at manipulating situations but not to hurt people.
See the signs, pick up on patterns. (Patterns are huge!) Always reading between the lines.
Predict many things before they happen.
Love to learn, love non-fiction.
Super deep. Hate small talk. Romantic AF. Spiritual.
Will let people ‘save face’ even though I know the truth of a situation. Don’t like to create waves.
End up in a lot of one-sided conversations where I’m the only one listening and giving advice.
Complex, always analyzing, thinking, processing.
Want to do good for people and make a difference in the world, but from behind the scenes.

230,"I struggle with ADHD, have an INFJ personality type, diagnosed 17 years ago with PTSD and was sheltered pretty heavily as a child.
I have fallen into abusive, narcissistic relationships.
I spent the better part of the last 15 years medicated to deal with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and ADHD. Medications caused more harm than good for me. I have been medication free for almost a year.
Reading through several posts here, I have heard so many people share experiences so similar to my own. Until today, I honestly felt like I was completely alone in how my mind works and how painful my emotions are for me. I’ve heard I’m too sensitive or I’m over reacting. Friends and family don't understand how I get so overwhelmed. They often ask why I don't come around, call, text or talk to people often.
It’s too overstimulating for me. The chaos of thoughts in my head are like a big rubber band ball, I have to take the time to find the “idea” (or outer rubber band) without disturbing anything else (the other rubber bands on the ball). However, life doesn’t always allow for the time that my brain needs to find that needed thought or ”idea” relevant to the situation at hand. So, the result is me fumbling around for the right “idea” or rubber band, but still seeing and finding other remotely relevant “ideas” in the process causing my ADHD to go haywire. I know that my thoughts are there and that they make sense, but the process of applying those thoughts coherently in the right moment, at the right time, with the right projection doesn't always happen. So, I question my capabilities and I doubt myself when it comes to those things in that particular moment. Then, in the midst of this anxiety and insecurity all at one time, it becomes paralyzing because I am once again stuck inside my head and can’t escape.
I will talk anyone's ear off about my “hot topic of the day” and, out of nowhere, will be hit by this crippling insecurity of “Am I talking too much?”, I lose track of my thought, I feel like what I was saying was either silly or irrelevant, or I now have no clue what I’m talking about and completely forget my point.

231,"I’m an INFJ and I’m pretty depressed right now so I’ll give a shot to explain how it feels. Keep in mind that I’m only one person and I don’t speak for everyone of this personality type. I can only speak for myself because I only knw my experiences.
Anyways, when I’m depressed it’s extremely difficult for me to find motivation in anything. Whether it’s doing something for school, friends, myself, or even something I normally enjoy like drawing or writing. It’s a lack of motivation and a feeling of uselessness.
I also tend to hide it a lot. In my mind, I’ve tried to label myself as “superman” who can always save the day for others and is someone people love and look up to. Super heroes are thought to be immortal and that’s how I feel I should be. This is a really detrimental mind set to get into because I am human and humans have flaws but it’s really easy to fall into and extremely difficult to get out of.
I’ll also end up secluding myself from family and friends and the world in general. When I get depressed I feel like I’m emotionally disconnected from the world and the people around me. It’s hard to talk and even simply be around others. Because of this it’s also difficult for me to reach out for help. I haven’t told my parents or anyone else in my family about my depression and how bad it can get sometimes.
It also comes with disregard for my health and hygiene. I know its sounds gross but there are times when it gets bad enough to where I can’t find the motivation to even shower. Something that can actually help someone relax.
When I get depressed it normally lasts for a while before I’m able to bounce back again. For me, depression isn’t really sadness. It’s a feeling of emptiness and tiredness with no purpose. Aimlessly floating through a colorful life being forced by myself to watch as it passes.
My case may be a bit more extreme than other’s. Clinical depression runs in my family so I could very well have a depression disorder of some sort which would amplify the symptoms.
Anyways, that's just my experience with it all.",GAD

233,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
234,"I'm not sure there's a way to answer this with anything resembling objectivity. There are several types of ADHD and it varies in severity as well as type. Of course the manifestation of ADHD is also highly affected by whether or not a person is receiving treatment and what kinds of coping skills they have developed. Then, when you add personality type, that's another variable. In this case, you've added the rarest of the MBTI types, INFJ, which makes up about 1 percent of the population.
Obviously, I can talk about what it's like to be me, but I don't think I've ever met another INFJ with ADHD—I meet INFJ's so rarely as it is—so it would be hard to determine how much is related to the intersection of those two traits, and how much is just particular to me.
The one thing I can be pretty sure about is that—just like an INFJ, due to rarity, is quite frequently misunderstood—an INFJ with ADHD, being even rarer, is even more likely to be misunderstood.
The whole dynamic of how INFJ's understand things quickly via intuition is heightened by the speed at which my brain works in other areas, too. And the fact that ADHD makes me more sensitive to stimuli means that I am easily overwhelmed by situations which involve a lot of people. I am strongly affected by the emotions of others but I am also strongly affected by noise, movement, visual stimuli, and especially tactile stimuli. It's like being a typical introvert, but all the things I would normally avoid are much “louder” and more overwhelming than for most introverts.
INFJ's are often mistaken for extroverts. This effect seems to be increased by the way ADHD causes me to hyperverbalize. So I am often sought after by people who really don't understand my need to be alone, as, when we are together, I may be quite talkative--regardless of whether or not I actually want to talk (usually, I do not). My impulsivity of speech and my introverted nature are at war in social situations. I often have people ask me what's wrong when I'm quiet. The answer is either: I'm listening, I'm overwhelmed and I've zoned out, or (rarely) I'm comfortable with you. Quiet is my natural default but it is difficult to maintain in the presence of other people. So I generally prefer to be alone.
I have all the peculiarities of most ADHDers and most INFJ's. My intuitive side and extroverted feeling keep me from being insensitive in the way some ADHDers may be, assuming I'm paying attention. I put a lot of effort into paying attention, but I often can't. When I inadvertently hurt others due to my ADHD (usually because they expect more than I’m capable of), it causes me distress. Another reason why I usually prefer to be alone.
Most of my relationships are one-sided. People seem drawn to me but they drain me. They take but they don't give or, most often, they give the opposite of what I need or want, and don't understand why I'm standoffish. I find extroverts generally exhausting and don't really like being around them. But they seem to be everywhere. And, for some unknown reason, they seem to like me.",GAD
235,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD

237,"Being an INFJ is different for everyone. For me, I overthink everything.
It's a constant battle of ""why?"", and I question the universe. Constantly. It's quite tiresome. I live in my head, and zone out everywhere just thinking. I read a lot, and I feel emotions very strongly.
When I walk into a room, I can sense the atmosphere, and I can sense how people are feeling.
When I'm around certain people, I tend to mirror them; how they act, how they talk. The effect can last for some time.
I love to tidy things up, and to organize things, even if my room's a mess.
I tend to jump around in my thoughts a lot, and tend to be a very forgetful person. I rely heavily on making random lists of things to do, and my planner. Oh, my planner. Despite all this, I procrastinate.
I'm super, super quiet if I'm around someone I don't know, or someone I'm not comfortable with. However, I get lonely and depressed very easily.

Talking to a girl was agonizing, especially the cute girls, heh. Even boys because I never met their interests. I wasn't that into sports, I wasn't as upfront with my decisions, i was less energetic and slow. You get the idea.
You feel like an outcast in every situation. You long for a connection with your “friends”. You try to fit in, but It never works out because you're stuck. Stuck in that jail of yours in your head, and you can never seem to find the key to unlock it. Because you're blind, the world around you is foggy. You feel like a shadow, you're just black and white, missing the right colors.
this answer turned into a creative outlet for me, hah. I hope this answer shows the perspective of how social anxiety feels like. Well, what it mostly felt like to me and that some of you can relate to it.
Adios!",GAD
239,"I'm just going to write a post I made on my Tumblr blog. These are only the struggles though. I'll put up the pros of being an INTJ later:
20 Struggles of an INTJ
1. We hardly enjoy mainstream movies because we successfully predict the rest of the movie as we go on watching it. We get an urge to say “I told you this would happen!” every time something we predicted happens. But we have to shut up because it’s pissing people off.
2. We always end up finding different solutions to curb the chaos and confusion we encounter in daily life. Then we go on a tirade about how it can be improved/avoided but even after having all the right ideas, we can’t do shit about it, and that’s really irritating.
3. We vanish off the face of the Earth for 10 hours straight, not even realizing it. When all our friends later ask us where we went, we’re not able to explain that we got busy doing/reading something interesting, and didn’t feel like being disturbed.
4. Our extrovert friends don’t understand why we can’t go out everyday. It’s mentally draining. I need some time by myself to relax, and think, and then mentally prepare for the next outing.
5. When we state our extremely free thinking opinion about something and watch people’s mouths drop. Like no, there’s nothing wrong with the way I think. Y’all are too wrapped up in the mainstream culture to look beyond it.
6. We tend to block out external sounds, and that’s great when we need to get some work done, but it’s not great when there’s a person standing next to us, talking on and on about something (or even on the phone) and we have no idea what they said because we were busy thinking.
7. Our mouth really needs a ‘harsh and cruel things’ filter because we’re just trying to be straightforward and honest but more often than not we just end up saying the bitter truths the other person doesn’t want to hear. Sometimes I know I’m being harsh and I should maybe not be that honest, but I can’t stop it.
8. As much as we love to debate and argue, there’s always the possibility that we’ll lose an argument, and there’s nothing more vexing (unless our logic is faulty, in which case it’s okay. But our logic is almost never wrong, so losing in that case hurts our ego.)
9. When talking to one of our acquaintances, we have to keep in check the information we reveal that we know about that person. So that we don’t appear to be stalkers, when in reality we’re just really observant and remember tiny things about people (Also, we might have gone through their Facebook page once or twice.)
10. We despise group projects. Not only will we have to work with comparatively inefficient people, their skills and hard work will affect our success (what a nightmare!) The only way we’re going to be even remotely comfortable with this group thing is if everyone listens to us and tries to follow the proper steps that will cause the work to finish on time and in an efficient manner.
11. If suddenly something captures our attention, we just have to know each and everything about it. It often leads to us not doing other things that require our attention more. Same goes with puzzles or problems that involve calculation. We don’t let go until we’ve solved it, and our methods are almost always different from the mainstream methods, so it pisses us off even more when it doesn’t seem to work.
12. It’s difficult for us to digest compliments and react to them. Like if someone says we’re “cute” or “smart”, we resist the urge to say “I know”, because we do. We are self confident individuals who know our strengths and weaknesses. Plus, we’ve been told that so often that saying “thank you” again and again has become tiresome.
13. Our flirting style is an awkward mix of subtle compliments and sarcastic good humored insults. It’s kinda different from mainstream flirting which is why our crushes never realize that we genuinely like them.
14. We can’t take it when someone does something very slowly (unless performing that action in a slow manner would improve the quality of the work.) Nothing is more excrutiating than sitting beside someone, seeing them struggle as they slowly do whatever has to be done. We resist the urge to push them off and do it in their place (Sorry, Te function makes us that way.)
15. Whenever we end up in a situation where logic defies us and feelings take over, there’s at least one moment when we go completely bonkers and try to get rid of those feelings (”Nope, nope, nope. Feelings? Nope.”) It’s terrifying yet exciting at the same time.
16. Wanting to kill people on a daily basis (don’t even deny it) because they act dumb, foolish, incompetent or plain annoying.
17. Having to deal with small talk. Like no, I don’t want you to ask me how my day was. I don’t want to ask you how your day was. I want to question the existence of humanity and discuss the mysteries of this world (and conspiracy theories! And a certain book/movie/game etc.)
18. When we have a fight with someone, especially someone who is close to us, we often end up saying very hurtful things that we know will hit the spot. It’s like a battle of words, and we sure as hell don’t plan to lose. So we play dirty, often hurting those who mean the world to us. Only realizing a couple of hours later that what we did was absolutely unacceptable.
19. We’re great with pre-project preparation and planning. Sometimes we get interested in something out of the blue, and spend hours researching it and making notes and planning things. But when the time to implement it comes around, we realize we’ve lost interest.
20. Spending unnecessary time perfecting something knowing full well that no one besides us would notice that folly. Sometimes being a perfectionist sucks.",GAD
240,"Here is my story:
I am a 27 years old male. I just found this personality test an year ago. Before that, I used to seriously think that I was a psychopath. No one understood me, except for my brother (he turned out to be ENTJ lol) and two of my very best friends (they turned out to be INTP and INFJ lol). People always shunned me, because I was called geek, weirdo, freak, arrogant and stoic. Men are expected to be athletic, outgoing, cheerful, full of life and team player, but I have always been the exact opposite. I preferred books over looks, and this bugged everybody around me.
Finding myself as an INTJ really helped me understand not only myself, but other people as well. I came to know that many people that I could not connect with, were either ESFJs, ESFPs, or ESTPs. Needless to say, I have been shunned my entire life. My parents and other siblings are all Sentinels (XSXJ), therefore, I could not connect with them either (even though they are all extremely loving and caring).
As an INTJ, you will never find a “perfect date”. You can make friends with other Analysts (XNTX) and Diplomats (XNFX), but they will still never be the same. No one can understand your ambition, your impatience and your chess-like-maneuvering, because people are not a cautious as you. You have already planned your life goals 20 years in future, but others do not even have their present shit together. You see people’s bullshit so well, that you seem to think that you are surrounded by liars. This drives you utterly mad, and makes you think: Am I the only one, who does not lie? Many people will tell you to slow down, relax and “live in the moment”. But you know very well, that you are not born to relax. Your mind works like a rocket, spiraling out of control; so it needs to be in a constant working phase, or it gets bored easily.
People also say, that I always wear a resting bitch face. I find it so funny. I guess I need to watch myself. I am just always analyzing people, because I find them as subjects for my fascination, but not as someone who I can ever connect on an inte...

241,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions
If you or anyone you know have any doubts about having mental health issues, I advice you to get it checked by a psychiatrist. It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders
I hope this helped :)",GAD
242,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is versatile and can address various anxiety disorders. While applying CBT for social anxiety may focus on specific social situations, its principles can be adapted to target generalized anxiety. A skilled therapist will tailor the therapy to your needs, helping you develop coping mechanisms and address underlying thought patterns contributing to both social anxiety disorder (SAD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).",GAD
243,"I started doing the CBT, but to be honest, I did not find it helpful.
What helped me the most, was healing the past and developing a deep love and compassion for myself.
I had to wait 6 months when I needed the help, and because of the delay, took matters into my own hands. I had skills from my past profession to get started with and did some study to upskill and help myself.
What I did in the end of was develop an approach that worked for me very quickly.
Usually we develop anxiety because there was a trauma of some sort in our childhood, or our past that affected us deeply. We get labelled with PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder. What we often do is take that on as who we are, not realising that we can heal from the trauma.
We have emotions from the past trauma that often come up later in life to be released, especially when we are in a safe position to be able to process them. What we often to do is use addictions of one sort or another to make those emotions go away.
What we need to do is allow those emotions to come up, be felt and be released, otherwise the emotions get stronger, the anxiety gets stronger because it is harder to shove them down. Sound familiar at all?
So I stopped my addictions because I was determined that I was going to finally heal, once and for all from my past.
The emotions came up and I felt them, cried through several boxes of tissues, and after releasing, each time, I filled myself with love to fill the void left by the emotion going.
Hand in hand with the releasing, I chose to consider the part of me that was wounded as my ‘Inner Child’ since the trauma occured when I was little, and I became the new parent. It is called reparenting. So I imagined i had a little girl with me all the time, and spoke to her, nurtured her, and listened to her. One of the way I gave myself love was to place a hand on my heart and said, with meaning ‘I love you’. In time, I felt this as a warmth spreading through me.
Due to the anxiety, I also had a voice in my head I call the Inner Critic, who wouldn’t shut up, and it was constantly breating me, worrying about the future, or nagging about anything. While I was talking to my inner child in a loving way, I found that the Inner Critic spoke less and less and eventually went silent. Because I was acknowledging my hurt self, there was no need for it to constantly draw my attention by nagging. It was a benefit that happened and a happy side effect of the loving talk. There went most of my stress straight away in the silencing of that voice!
There are other levels of healing. There are false limiting beliefs we can bring through life with us. Having done that part of the CBT, i have to say that I didn’t really link in with mine because they were not coming up in the process given by CBT. For limiting beliefs, hypnotherapy is very effective because we can regress back to when the beliefs first began, and a Master Hypnotherapist can enable you to have a conversation with your Inner Child and resolve the issue on the spot. Once you sort the initial moment that the belief was created, the rest of the times it has been reinforced and many related false beleifs fall away, like pearls falling off a necklace when the string is cut.
Hypnotherapy can be really helpful for anxiety because of the ability to regress, and it can very quickly get to the root cause and heal it. It may only take one or two sessions.
Yes, one of the skills I already had was the fundamentals of hypnotherapy and I recently upskilled myself to better help people with anxiety and abuse related troubles.
That is my opinion, that is my journey. I hope you find something useful for your healing journey in all that great big long answer :-D",GAD
244,"Yes, cognitive behavioral therapy is indicated for GAD. It may also be appropriate to use medication to help, depending on the initial severity that you present with.",GAD

When I turned 35, I decided I had to do something about it. At the time, I was traveling constantly for business. So I forced myself to start conversations with strangers in airports. I figured if it went bad, I would never see them again. It wasn’t easy. At first I didn’t know what to say. So I just listened to conversations around me and copied other people.
What I discovered is that people are actually very nice. No one was mean, no one was rud...

247,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
248,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
249,"My first pick wouldn’t be teaching people to reframe the irrational beliefs that trigger their anxiety, or exploring childhood issues, various drives and motivations, etc. Since those disorders are painful and limiting right now, and since the symptoms are measurable and available here and now, and since somatic strategices really work well, I’m going for symptomatic relief full on, if it seems right for the client. CBT is very popular these days, and psychodynamic therapy can be helpful long-term.
Treating the anxiety first, head-on, make sense to me and it’s what I teach. CBT is good, but too often it becomes training in reframing/replacing irrational beliefs that result in bad feelings, and even more often it’s taught and adopted in a superficial way, involving work sheets and homework: no need for unconditional empathy and a serious commitment from an insightful and skilled therapist. Psychodynamic therapy requires long training and serious skill, and time.",GAD
250,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely-used therapy for anxiety disorders. Research has shown it to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder, phobias, social anxiety disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder, among many other conditions.
Cognitive behavioral therapy addresses negative patterns and distortions in the way we look at the world and ourselves. As the name suggests, this involves two main components:
Cognitive therapy examines how negative thoughts, or cognitions, contribute to anxiety.
Behavior therapy examines how you behave and react in situations that trigger anxiety.
The basic premise of cognitive behavioral therapy is that our thoughts—not external events—affect the way we feel. In other words, it’s not the situation you’re in that determines how you feel, but your perception of the situation. For example, imagine that you’ve just been invited to a big party. Consider three different ways of thinking about the invitation, and how those thoughts would affect your emotions. Therapy may be conducted individually, or it may take place in a group of people with similar anxiety problems.
Situation: A friend invites you to a big party
Thought #1: The party sounds like a lot of fun. I love going out and meeting new people!
Emotions: Happy, excited
Thought #2: Parties aren’t my thing. I’d much rather stay in and watch a movie.
Emotions: Neutral
Thought #3: I never know what to say or do at parties. I’ll make a fool of myself if I go.
Emotions: Anxious, sad
As you can see, the same event can lead to completely different emotions in different people. It all depends on our individual expectations, attitudes, and beliefs. For people with anxiety disorders, negative ways of thinking fuel the negative emotions of anxiety and fear. The goal of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety is to identify and correct these negative thoughts and beliefs.
The idea is that if you change the way you think, you can change the way you feel.
No. Online cognitive behavioral therapy does not work for any anxiety disorder.",GAD
251,"Social anxiety disorder let me simplify it by using an example….
You are alone, go to school daily seeing a lot of peers having a group of friends who just chill and enjoy each other. You feel like what is problem with me!? Why can't I make friends like them! They just ignore my talks, not even say me hi. Day goes boring and thoughts come in your negative side of your brain. Which leads to anxiety and depression. It was a story but in reality it is happening more and more. Our world is lacking the mental illness cure
Social anxiety disorder means you are left alone and not be social anymore, having no friends which I think bieng alone is better than a group of friends. You can explore your life freely enjoy yourself. Make good friend a single friend is enough who thinks about you and respect your character. You know nowadays good friends are like finding a needle in dump. Once you found a rare friend, next you will be successful
Mark my words- Don't worry you have no friend at all or just one as one friend can change your character and behaviour for lifetime. Depends upon you that which typo friend you made. Choice yours good or bad. If no then wait because nature has a good perspective",GAD
252,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
253,"TECHNICAL ANSWER
The highly reductive and inaccurate claim, based on a misunderstanding of cognitive theories of psychotherapy is that irrational beliefs produce negative emotions leading to negative behavior, and that replacing the irrational beliefs will lead to positive behavior.
Not so, at least for anxiety reduction. The most likely mechanism is that, as with any therapy that reduces anxiety, the result is from desensitization by reciprocal inhibition. Expressing and exploring phobic reactions in a safe and comforting setting is what does it, for everything from EMDR to psychoanalysis to Rogerian or Jungian therapies, to chatting with a supportive friend.
PLAIN ANSWER
Yes, CBT, even when done as a paint-by-the-numbers rigid worksheet approach, can help you reduce anxiety, for the same reason that all therapies can: you face your fears in a relaxed, safe place, by talking about them a lot.",GAD
254,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
255,"Research has shown that CBT is very effective for anxiety disorder treatment. I do not have the studies in front of me to quote specific numbers, but CBT is commonly seen as one of the best, if not the absolute best non-medication treatments for anxiety disorders.
(I want to be careful… since every person is different, it is possible that another style of therapy would be a better fit in a specific case depending on personal factors of the client and the therapist. But speaking generally, CBT is reliable and very effective.)
If you feel anxious, nervous, or scared most of the time, or if you feel like fear, worry or nervousness keep you from doing things that are important to you, then it is worth talking with a mental health therapist. Before they start any treatment, they will do a diagnostic assessment.
Remember, a diagnosis is just a shorthand description of your experiences. It is not about judging you or your life. And your therapist will probably tell you the diagnosis. In my opinion, they should tell you the diagnosis. From there, you and the therapist will make a plan for how you will work to solve your problem. If that problem is rooted in anxiety, then there is a very high chance that your therapist will use CBT techniques.",GAD
256,"For some people it can be very helpful, or for some its completely useless, and for others somewhere in-between, it really does depend on the individual.
Your need for proof, is probably an indication of the fear you feel when thinking about addressing your anxiety disorder, why not just find out for yourself have therapy, and get your own proof?
I find that when people use the word cure in reference to therapy and recovery, it often is an expression of hope, that the therapy will do all the hard work for them.
This is the truth, to start any recovery or start to tackle any issue, first you need to make a choice, are you going to try or not, if you decide to try you need to take responsibility and do an action, such as start therapy, or start to do something beneficial like meditation or learn to be mindful, while also collecting as much information as possible, about what helps people deal with anxiety.
If you decide not to take an action, that's understandable, as facing anxiety can be very scary, in that case, perhaps you need to spend more time thinking about it, until your ready to make the choice you need to make, or are able to find the courage to start.
Remember that Its your responsibility, no one will do it for you.",GAD
257,"A little. But don’t expect CBT to be adequate. CBT is cognitive, and anxiety is emotional. The CBT claims that correct thinking can fix anxiety is off the mark because thinking is an experimental process, not a controllable product.
Though thoughts can be seen as the cause of anxiety, they aren’t. They are associated with anxiety but are not the cause of anxiety.
The real issue is whether we recognize our thoughts as just thoughts. They may accurately represent reality or they may not. Too many of us believe that whatever is in the mind is equal to what is in the world. That is a view all kids have until about the age of three, at which time we are supposed to recognize that there is a difference between what is in the mind and what is in the world. The difference can be small or large. How different it is depends upon how well we examine, critique, revise, edit, etc. our thought processes. But people who are what psychologists call “concrete” in their thinking do not reflect on their thought processes and correct them. They just believe what is in their mind and what is true are one-and-the-same. This is a form of insanity. It is a form of insanity that sane people recognize. Meanwhile, the insane people who believe whatever is in their mind is true are absolutely sure they are the sane ones.
Psychological theorist Peter Fonagy has suggested that a person with poor self-esteem may have no more negative thoughts than a person with good self-esteem, and the difference may be simply whether or not the person believes everything that comes to mind.
The same applies to our socio-political situation. Some people reflect on their thinking, examine it, and make it as accurate as they can. Others can’t tolerate reflecting on their own thinking. They - instead of trying to fine-tune it - just believe it, and are hostile to sciences that examine things.
So, to some degree, the person who does not look inward and examine his/her thinking avoids looking inward to avoid the distress that they would feel. By staying mind-blind, they avoid awareness of inner conflict, awareness of some of their fears, and awareness that their interest in things they have been taught are unacceptable to be interested in.

258,"My therapist told me something that helped carry me though therapy, and that was, “Trust the process.” CBT was not available to me then but when I took it, years later, I saw that it was a very useful shortcut that taught the things I had learned the hard way.
CBT is not magic so don’t expect instant cures; it still depends on how dedicated you are to attending regularly, doing the homework, and thinking (and feeling) about the issues it brings up to see how it applies to you. It is possible to overcome social anxiety and low self-esteem in CBT but it will take time. In my case, I was successful in large part because I practiced Transcendental Meditation, which research shows to be of major helpfulness in expanding the mind and reducing the deep-rooted stresses that are the cause of problems.
Good luck!",GAD
259,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition that can cause excessive and persistent worry and anxiety about various aspects of life. There are several ways to reduce the symptoms of GAD:
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of talk therapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It can help you identify and challenge negative thoughts that contribute to your anxiety.
Medication: Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines may be prescribed to help manage anxiety symptoms.
Relaxation techniques: Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety by calming the mind and body.
Exercise: Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters.
Sleep hygiene: Getting enough restful sleep can help reduce anxiety. Good sleep hygiene practices include sticking to a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and creating a calming sleep environment.
Avoidance of triggers: Identify triggers that make your anxiety worse and try to avoid them or reduce exposure to them.
Social support: Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your anxiety can help you feel less alone and more supported.
It is important to remember that everyone's experience with GAD is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It may take some trial and error to find the right combination of treatments that work for you. If you are struggling with GAD, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for additional guidance and support.",GAD

261,"Yes, 100% Yes
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is normally comorbid with other conditions like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar however you can certainly have other anxiety disorder on top of GAD like Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Phobia’s
Me personally, I have generalized anxiety disorder alongside social anxiety disorder and separation anxiety however my anxieties are all comorbid to my Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis. Though I do believe the SAD and the SA is also a byproduct of my GAD diagnosis.",GAD
262,In general most experts don’t consider most mental disorders curable. However most are treatable. All anxiety disorders including social anxiety disorder are treatable. The best treatment for anxiety disorders is CBT including exposure exposure. ERP or exposure and response prevention is primarily used to treat OCD. The response prevention or ritual prevention refers to stopping compulsions. The behavior that needs to be stopped in anxiety disorders is referred to as safety behaviors and I often includes avoidance. The difference leads to not calling it ERP when applied to anxiety disorders but the underlying principle is the same.,GAD
263,"I'm going to give you the straightest, best answer you'll find on this site and I'll tell you why- I had severe social anxiety since adolescence and have (mostly) successfully overcome it.
Let me reveal to you a little about my history. I was a bright kid, had a pleasing personality, was an okay athlete, and a fairly good musician. But I was wracked by a weird thing I couldn't name: I would never raise my hand in class, never mind attend school dances, proms, or parties.
It was only later, when I became a psychiatrist, that I learned I was suffering from anxiety, specifically social anxiety.
People who don't experience it will never understand, and never understand the crippling nature of this disorder.
It's late, and I don't have the energy to find the research sources to back up my statements, but I've researched everything I'm going to tell you. I'm not practicing medicine right now, so please take this as friendly advice.
(1) Social anxiety is almost certainly genetic in origin. I'm betting your family didn't talk much because you almost certainly have other family members who suffer also. If you look at your relatives, you'll find at least a few who are very private or shy and have somehow accommodated to their disorder.
(3) Talk therapy doesn't help that much. In my opinion (and I treated hundreds of people with social anxiety) social anxiety is not so much a psychological problem as a genetic predisposition. Just like it's really hard to talk yourself out of OCD, or panic attacks, or phobias, talk therapy won't do much (if anything) for social anxiety.
(4) Think about what social anxiety is. What is happening to you is that in social situations you are feeling judged (and monitored). This is an unconscious reaction (and, from an evolutionary standpoint, not pathological at all-but that's another sub...

264,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is when you worry about small things and get overanxious thinking about them. For instance, you’re running out of your food tonight, so you get worried that you have to buy your food tomorrow. So, you get worrying about things like, what if I get up late tomorrow to go to the supermarket, what if my favorite food runs out of stock tomorrow etc etc. So, you’d excessively worry about small things like schools, works or worse, in case of a meeting and etc etc.
Whereas, a social anxiety is when you get nervous when interacting with other people. Or get worrying too much about how you’re going to have a good conversation and what if the conversation turns to be bad.
So, the basic difference is that in Social Anxiety, people get anxious only when it relates to social interaction, but in case of GAD, people get anxious on small issues even if it doesn’t involve social interactions. Nevertheless, a person may develop both at the same time.",GAD
265,"A typical generalised anxiety mental commentary: ""What if my plane crashes?""; ""What if my partner is late home because he got in a car accident?""; ""What if I get salmonella poisoning from this chicken that's about to expire?""; ""What if that dot on my skin is cancer?""; ""What if that leashed dog somehow attacks me as I walk past?"" Etc.
A typical social anxiety running commentary: ""What if my friend thinks I hate her because I took two days to reply to her text?""; ""What if I talk in this meeting and others think I sound dumb?""; ""What if I am honest and the person gets offended and doesn't like me anymore?""; ""What if I go to the party and nobody wants to talk to me and I look like a total loner?"" Etc.
In a nutshell, irrational fear of many different things going wrong vs. big fear of others thinking badly of you.",GAD
266,"Generalized Anxiety disorder is about being suffering anxiety symptoms that aren’t specifically about one thing. Someone with this condition may have certain things they are more sensitive to that make their anxiety worse like travelling, conversations, going in a lift, but there anxiety isn’t caused by one specific thing.
Social Anxiety Disorder is a condition where the person experiences anxiety directly from interacting with others. This can be in person or on the phone or because they are in a crowded space.",GAD
267,"I’m at school sitting quietly but calmly outside the counselors’ offices waiting for my counselor to finish up with a student so I could talk to her about doubling up on my math classes.
As I wait patiently I notice, out of the corner of my eye, a girl walking up to the door leading to room of offices, pausing, walking back around the corner and out of sight then back again. She does this again and again, mumbling to herself, clearly trying to work up the courage to do something.
I’m curious and a bit concerned. After the 4th time she walks by I decide to get her attention.
Hey, are you ok?
She squeaks, her entire face turns really red to my surprise and she mumbles something I can’t make out.
Hmm? Can you repeat that again?
I.. I’m fine. She says not looking at me.
Oh
I hem and haw wondering if I’m invading her privacy by asking (she already looks so uncomfortable) but decide to anyway.
What’s got you so worked up? You’ve been walking back and forth for a while.
She seems utterly embarrassed and looks petrified. I’m a bit horrified and am wondering if I’m truly that terrifying.
I look away uncomfortably already feeling kinda awkward about stepping out of my comfort zone and making the truly dreaded small talk.
Me looking away seems to give her the courage to talk, though. Or perhaps she just really wanted to tell/talk to someone.
I learn that she was a new student and was trying to go into the office, talk to the lady at the desk and get her class schedule. I’m very clearly baffled and a little bemused that such a little thing would take so much effort but stand up and help her out.
We very slowly become good friends throughout the year and I later learn that she has social anxiety. She has a very hard time interacting in social situations without getting too nervous/panicky.
It is literally a heart-pounding, adrenaline rushing situation for her to ask a stranger a question.
When I got to know her better and thus the rest of her personality, she turned out to be a really funny, sweet, sarcastic, kinda crazy in a fun way girl.
But I also learned how her social anxiety debilitated her social life. How she struggles each day, because to her talking to people involves playing a kinda tug-of-war with her mind, wanting to talk to people but being too afraid/worried to. Being alone is easier but desiring social interaction is a human trait. So ppl with social anxiety struggle with this mental fight.
I’m an introvert. I adore my alone time. I can spend hours upon hours alone, doing my own thing, only popping back out for food runs and such.
However, I also enjoy being socially active. I like going new places, talking to new people, experiencing new things. Hearing strangers’ stories. I’m always up for going paint balling with new friends I just met in college, just as I’m equally ok with staying home all by myself with just books and/or my netflix. The only thing being introverted means is that I need recharging time. Spending too much time with ppl can be tiring. Not hard but I do feel irritable after long periods of ‘peopling’. Its like a battery. I gotta go relax by myself to get back to 100%.
I don’t have social anxiety and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. I can’t speak from experience but it seems like your own mind is your enemy. Always second-guessing, always creating scenarios that aren’t real. Hear a group laughing as the walk past you? Oh, they must be laughing at you.
Alhamudulillah, my friend is doing much better than when I first met her in our freshman year of high school. She went/goes to therapy to overcome a good portion of her anxiety and is doing amazing. I’m glad for her.",GAD
268,"Distinguishing social anxiety from general anxiety involves recognizing triggers and contexts. While general anxiety is pervasive, social anxiety centers on social situations. Seek professional guidance for an accurate diagnosis. Our Quora Space on Anxiety Disorders provides information and community support for individuals navigating various anxiety-related challenges.",GAD
269,"Generalized is that many things can cause anxiety in you. School, work, relationships, family, new plans. It means you worry in general about the outcomes of things.
Social anxiety is directly linked to people. I have it. Going to school is not a fun thing when you are socially anxious. Probably one had had bad past experiences with people.",GAD
270,"I don’t know when I ever felt “normal” anxiety, but from what I’ve observed, it’s more reasonable than GAD-anxiety. A lot more.
The metaphor I like using (and I’ve seen around a lot) is that it’s like missing a step while climbing the stairs. Normal anxiety is panicking for a few seconds before you catch yourself; once your foot is on the next step, you sigh in relief and continue on, likely forgetting about it ten minutes later.
Generalized anxiety is when there is no other step and it feels like you’re falling forever, and it takes a while before you find your footing again as your brain is yelling at you that there will never be another step and you doomed yourself.
Normal anxiety is when you worry about sensible things; an exam, job interview, asking someone you like out for the very first time, things like that.
GAD is also worrying about those things, but everything is upped to 11,000. It’s slightly different for each person, but from my experience, I get nervous about tests and social groups the moment I learn about them. Everyday things that everyone goes through, I panic inside about all the ways it can go wrong. I can’t even play guessing games with my friends because I panic over nothing. The simple English class homework assignment that’s a page long? Takes me over two hours to do because I think there’s a trick question somewhere and “it can’t be this easy”.
The worst and most drastic difference between the two? Normal anxiety is temporary. GAD causes those who have it to often be on edge; I’d have trouble even staying outside on a windy, peaceful day because - true story - I’ll jump after hearing a leaf land on concrete. That wouldn’t register in a person’s mind if they didn’t have anxiety, besides maybe observing the leaf fall.
Another way to think of it is GAD is having a mental sonar radar always on. When there’s a sudden noise or something unexpected happens, there’s a red flashing “ping” on the radar. Everything in your body goes to Red Alert, and will continue until the source/reason of the suddenness is discovered and deemed harmless, then to wait until the nerves calm down from being frazzled.
I hope that all helps!",GAD
271,"Generalized anxiety and social anxiety are distinct anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety involves excessive worry about various aspects of life, while social anxiety centers on fear and avoidance of social situations. Seeking professional evaluation can provide clarity on the specific anxiety disorder you may be experiencing. Our Quora Space on Anxiety Disorders offers information on different anxiety conditions and coping strategies.",GAD
272,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD

275,"I consider myself an introvert in the sense that I prefer to be alone or at least with my immediate family and the few friends I am really comfortable with. I don’t mind doing things on my own, like going shopping and taking walks and I actually prefer it sometimes. Meeting strangers or new people takes a lot out of me and I don’t quite find it immediately appealing. I even find it uncomfortable to meet some of the people I already know so I usually just stick to myself and the few people in my life I’m truly comfortable with.
However, when the situation calls for it i.e. birthday, wedding etc. I put on my best outfit, do up my hair and I try my best at those events. I don’t get invited to many of those anymore so it’s a big relief already. Sometimes, my introvert nature does border on anxiety and it has actually gotten worse since I have become older but so far, I haven’t had any serious meltdowns requiring hospitalisation. Usually, I just need to go home and take a rest and I’ll be good to go after a night’s sleep.
When somebody has social anxiety disorder, they literally cannot handle having to do the simplest tasks that other people take for granted. For example, most of us think nothing of getting food at places like McDonald’s and Subway’s but for people who have social anxiety disorder, they literally have to muster up every amount of mental and emotional energy they can gather just to take that first step of actually just making an order. It is exacerbated by the fact that they are aware of what is happening with them and that the fear of being laughed at or mocked at adds onto their already fragile and vulnerable state of mind.
And this disorder isn’t new as people in the past have suffered it too but there wasn’t a proper diagnosis for it all those years ago. Jane Fonda has spoken about Marilyn Monroe in interviews over the years about the anxiety Ms Monroe suffered. Ms Monroe had had a reputation of always being late to almost anything including press conferences and film sets and without knowing about her disorder, naturally people mistook it for normal tardiness and disrespect when she actually spent hours trying to calm herself down enough to go out and do what she needed to do.
And the world nowadays is a lot tougher than it ever was with social media highlighting every little flaw a person may have. More and more people are reported to have social anxiety disorders and it isn’t easy for them all around. All we can do is try to understand that it is difficult all round, for everybody and be kind to one another. The world seriously needs more of it.",GAD
276,"Social anxiety is when you get extremely anxious in social settings like a grocery store for example. And general anxiety is getting anxious about just about anything in an excessive manner. A lot of people nowadays will claim they have social anxiety or general anxiety, but dont know the true meanings behind them. I suffer from social anxiety. Its a real pain in the ass. All the time people will say they have it too like its contagious or something, but its not. Theres a difference between the two, like i had mentioned before, and in order to fully understand these types of anxieties, speak to someone who has social anxiety and someone who has general anxiety, and who actually went to a certified doctor for these things.",GAD
277,"I have both. With social anxiety disorder, there are times when being around other people causes so much stress, I start shaking. I second guess things I say for fear of embarrassing myself, and I over analyze every conversation. Generalized anxiety disorder causes me to always be on edge. A car door slamming outside makes me jump out of my skin. I just feel nervous, constantly.",GAD
278,"Social anxiety and introversion are two completely different things.
If you experience social anxiety you have an irrational, excessive fear of being embarrassed or judged. Ordinary interactions cause you tremendous amounts of stress.
Social anxiety disorder is a mental health condition and proper treatment can help you cope with it.
Introversion on its own does not imply social anxiety. Introverts often enjoy the company of others but are depleted by it and want to leave early so they can recharge.
You can be an introvert with social anxiety but many introverts (like me) experience no stress at all from being social. I just need to be alone sometimes.",GAD
279,"Anxiety is anxiety no matter what the name whether it be social, general or PTSD.
Usually it’s caused by your reaction to a situation, a situation involving fear of the possibility of a reoccurrence of a past event.
If you were badly bitten by a dog as a child you would more than likely experience fear of dogs when you were older. If your parents felt guilty about you being bitten it would exacerbate your feelings and if they were overprotective you could have acquired anxiety from them.",GAD
280,"No,it’s not.
General anxiety can occur from time to time,during difficult periods of your life or even when you change your envirorment and trying to adapt to all those changes which it brings.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder(GAD),on the other hand,is a whole different thing.
You worry excessively and a lot,so much so that it interferes with your daily activities.
(GAD) symptoms include:
Persistent worrying or obsession with small or large concerns that's out of proportion to the impact of the event
Inability to set aside or let go of a worry
Inability to relax, restlessness, and feeling keyed up or on edge
Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank""

281,"I used to have severe social anxiety when I was in my teens. It was so bad that I had to drop out of high school and I spent 10 years locked in my room because I was too afraid to go out into the world. I saw 7 therapists over a span of 8 years and they weren’t able to help me. Thank God I found something that enabled me to completely remove all traces of my anxiety.
The key isn’t to fight with your social anxiety, it’s to remove the causes of it.
The first step is to figure out what’s underpinning your anxiety. Ask yourself, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?” What do you have to believe about yourself, the world, other people and life in general in order to feel anxious in social situations?
Write down everything that comes to mind.
Next, learn EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). It’s a natural method of neutralizing negative emotions and thought patterns by using acupressure and cognitive behavioral therapy.
Go on Youtube and look up EFT for anxiety. There will be several videos there. Watch some and follow along. EFT is going to look ridiculous. It’s going to involve tapping certain places on your face multiple times and saying things related to the issue. Just give it a try and go with it.
Also, get the book The Tapping Solution by Nick Ortner. It’s good for beginners and covers a lot of issues, including anxiety and stress.
After you learn the EFT process (it’s not hard), apply it to everything you wrote down when you asked, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?”
Also, use it whenever you’re feeling anxious, upset or uncomfortable.
Something most people have an issue with when they are new to EFT is not knowing what to say when they tap. The best way to get around that is to imagine you’re talking to a close friend about whatever is bothering you and just vent as you tap. Get all of your thoughts and feelings out about the situation as you tap through each of the points. You will find this extremely effective.
Best of luck!",GAD
282,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
283,"When I’m nervous it is definitely with a reason- I get nervous when I interview for a job, I get nervous when I have to ask a big question, I get nervous talking to my boss- all are regular and alleviated within seconds of doing the act I am in fear of.
When I get anxious, it isn’t as simple. Anxiety creeps up sometimes on a car ride and somehow I feel like breathing is the most difficult thing that I need to actively think about to calm down- but it doesn’t calm me down.
I can be stuck in my tracks and get light headed and physically ill being anxious and needing to escape somewhere- but no where feels entirely the answer. It makes me physically shake and tremble and I get moderately nauseous and dizzy, so I try to excuse myself to the restroom or somewhere to lay down. But anxiety, definitely doesn’t have a reason , sometimes my body’s chemistry goes into overdrive on adrenaline and I get really worked up, and I can’t calm it down immediately.
The longest phase of anxiety for me was roughly 2 hours lon...

284,"Both of these disorders Generalized Anxiety and Social Anxiety are categorized by constant anxiety, patients of these disorders tend to confront severe anxiety.
However; their anxiety may differ, people who suffer from Social Anxiety disorder may experience anxiety about their social circle, like meeting new people, etc. and GAD people will face anxiety about general range of topics, that can be personal too.",GAD
285,"As someone who is autistic and has social anxiety, I feel qualified to answer this.
Autism (including aspergers) means the brain works differently in ways that affect every part of life. From hygiene, to diet, to work, to hobbies. The way it affects socializing is more visible, but it is only part of autism.
Socially, being autistic means that I don't pick up the rules for socializing through interacting with people. I needed to learn them the way an allistic person learns another language. And socializing with allistics always feels faintly unnatural like I'm playing a role and constantly trying to remember my lines so I don't mess up.
Social anxiety has a single specific affect. It makes you (irrationally) afraid to be around people. If it gets bad enough it can indirectly mess with other parts of your life—its hard to have a job when you are scared to leave your home. But those are indirect affects, not central to what social anxiety IS.
Being socially anxious means I get scared when I need to talk with people. In extreme cases, a person with social anxiety can be scare of simply encountering another person.
Many autistic people have social anxiety—it's scary to talk to people when you know at any moment you might offend, upset, or alienate them with no idea why. And if left unchallenged or untreated this fear can become excessive and irrational. Though, like all anxieties, it has a basis in a real issue. However not everyone who is autistic has social anxiety and not everyone who has social anxiety is autistic.",GAD
286,"If you’re unfortunate enough to be an individual that’s prone to go into panic attacks as a result and not knowing what to do about it. First time it happened to me was not ideal to say the least. Was on my way to a location over an hour way to deliver medical equipment when suddenly I began to lose feeling in my arms. Barely managed to pull over safely just in time because as I did they went limp. Idk how else to describe it other than when your foot falls asleep except it was both arms from shoulder blades all the way down.
I had no idea what was going on, thought maybe I was having a heart attack but that’s supposed to just be one arm, so figured possibly a stroke though again that’s typically one sided. Turns out I was hyperventilating which basically just means you’re not giving your lungs enough time to process each breath in order to do what it needs to do to feed your blood properly. Which is why rapid breathing causes people to pass out and incidentally which I had never heard of personally can cause you to lose feeling in your arms or legs.
I struggled with this in fear of how to anticipate stress with this development as was in my late twenties and had never experienced any anxiety like this before, was very concerning and confusing because I’ve always had anxiety, introverted tendencies and been in all kinds of situations, house fire, car accidents, attacked without Warning, cornered & jumped, mugged, stalked, harrassed, threatened, chewed out, singled out, made an example of, had to defend myself with force, attacked with a bat, use to rock climb/parkour, forced to perform physically, jumped off cliffs, atracked by a swarm of wasps, arrested, malested, tramautized, ptsd even chocked to the floor by my own father till i pissed myself once.. Had never even passed out, none of that had prepared me for or had any bearing in terms of serving me to effectively navigate the situation. Second time it happened i was just walking across my apt to take a load of laundry down. When completely without warning, lost feeling in both my legs, collapsed to the floor. My friend was convinced i was faking, even came over & kicked me before he realized i wasnt fuvckin round.
Id say whether you get panic attacks or not the worst thing about anxiety is the helplessness. Not knowing what to do. Luckily the solution regardless of the severity is the same. Learn to be mindful of youre breathing, practice controlling your breathing. Then eventually by doing this youll begin to start recognizing when you're starting to get like this, with practice you can stop it in its tracks entirely. Before i learned this had 4 incidents in total over a 4–5 year period. Hasnt happined since i mastered my breathing which no matter how. Much ive practiced never do i feel confident that its going to work, because thats what anxiety does to you, magnifies your doubts an insecurities, thats the final hurdle is pushing yourself to ignore what your head is telling you and focusing on doing what you are able to do in order to regain control of the situation. The reason this was such a challenge, in my experience was because i just somehow completely oblivious towards and unaware of how i was breathing. I mean how often do you actually think about the way you're breathing? The body does it for you. Ppp",GAD
287,"I was going to say that the scariest thing about generalized anxiety disorder is the lack of ability to control anxiety once it starts.
Now that I think about it, I actually find physical/psychosomatic symptoms of GAD to be a bit scarier than that because they are even less predictable.
I've had rather severe pains in my back several times after having had anxiety attacks.
They always come on after I assumed the anxiety attack had passed.
I've come down with illnesses shortly after having had anxiety attacks as well.
I'd only just recently learned that anxiety can manifest as physical symptoms beyond anxiety attacks.
I think not being able to predict whether or not I will develop muscle pains or fall ill is the scariest aspect of living with generalized anxiety disorder…for me, anyway.",GAD

289,"People with a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) feel constant worry or tension, even when there is no obvious cause. They may have trouble sleeping, concentrating, and completing everyday tasks. This can be a very disabling condition that significantly reduces the quality of life.
People with panic disorder experience sudden episodes of terror or intense fear. This often leads to physical symptoms such as sweating, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath. Panic disorder can be very debilitating and may significantly reduce the quality of life.
Both GAD and panic disorder are serious mental illnesses that require treatment. However, there are some key differences between these conditions.
GAD is characterized by long-term anxiety, while panic disorder is characterized by sudden, short-term attacks of intense fear.
GAD usually doesn't include physical symptoms like chest pain or dizziness, which are common in panic disorder.
People with GAD often worry about a wide range of things, while people with the panic disorder typically worry about having another panic attack.
People with GAD may also suffer from depression, substance abuse, or other anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is often linked to bipolar disorder and social phobia (a type of extreme shyness).
The symptoms of GAD tend to build slowly over time, while the symptoms of panic disorders can happen suddenly and without warning.
Both GAD and panic disorder can be treated with medication and therapy. However, the treatments for these conditions are often different.
People with GAD may be prescribed antidepressants, benzodiazepines (a type of tranquilizer), or other medications. Therapy for GAD usually focuses on teaching people how to manage their anxiety and worry.
People with panic disorder are often prescribed antidepressants or benzodiazepines. They may also benefit from psychological treatments that teach relaxation techniques and coping skills.
A person can have both GAD and panic disorder at the same time, which is sometimes referred to as a dual diagnosis. In these cases, it's important to get treatment for both conditions.
If you think you may have GAD or panic disorder, it's important to see a mental health professional for diagnosis and treatment. Both conditions can be treated successfully, and there is no need to suffer in silence.
Conclusion: People who have GAD typically worry about things more than once, while people with panic disorder usually don't. People with GAD may also suffer from depression or another anxiety disorder, while this is not common in panic disorder. The symptoms of GAD gradually build over time while the symptoms of panic disorders can come any time without warning. However, both GAD and panic disorder can be treated successfully with the right support.

290,"Understanding the difference between Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder is crucial for those seeking to comprehend their symptoms and find appropriate treatment. Both conditions fall under the umbrella of anxiety disorders, but they manifest differently and require distinct approaches for management and treatment. Here, we’ll explore the key differences between GAD and Panic Disorder.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
1. Definition
Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various aspects of daily life. This worry is often disproportionate to the actual situation and can interfere with daily functioning.
2. Symptoms
People with GAD may experience a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including:
Persistent worrying or anxiety about multiple areas of life (e.g., work, health, social interactions)
Restlessness or feeling on edge
Fatigue
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep problems include restless, unsatisfactory sleep, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and so on.
3. Duration
The symptoms of GAD are chronic and can persist for months or even years. To be diagnosed with GAD, the excessive worry and anxiety must be present more days than not for at least six months.
4. Triggers
GAD does not usually have specific triggers. The anxiety and worry are pervasive and related to a variety of situations and events, making it challenging to pinpoint a particular cause.
Panic Disorder
1. Definition
Unexpected, frequent panic attacks are the hallmark of panic disorder. These attacks are sudden periods of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and can be accompanied by physical symptoms.
2. Symptoms
During a panic attack, individuals may experience:
Heart palpitations or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
breathing difficulties or a suffocating sensation
Feelings of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness
Chills or heat sensations
Numbness or tingling sensations
Depersonalization, or feeling cut off from oneself, or derealization, are two examples of these feelings.
Fear of losing control or ""going crazy""
Fear of dying
3. Duration
Panic attacks typically last for a few minutes but can occasionally persist longer. The frequency of panic attacks can vary widely, from several attacks a day to a few attacks a year.
4. Triggers
Panic attacks in Panic Disorder are often unexpected and can occur without an obvious trigger. However, some people may develop a fear of situations where they previously experienced a panic attack, leading to avoidance behaviors.
Key Differences
1. Nature of Anxiety
GAD: Anxiety is constant and related to various aspects of life.
Panic Disorder: Anxiety is episodic, occurring in the form of panic attacks that are intense but brief.
2. Triggers
GAD: Anxiety is generalized and not tied to specific situations or events.
Panic Disorder: Panic attacks can be unexpected and may not have a clear trigger.
3. Symptoms
GAD: Symptoms include ongoing worry, restlessness, fatigue, and physical symptoms like muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: Symptoms are acute during panic attacks, including heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and intense fear.
4. Duration
GAD: Symptoms are chronic and persist over a long period.
Panic Disorder: Panic attacks are short-lived but recur over time.
Conclusion
While both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder involve anxiety, they differ significantly in their presentation, triggers, and symptomatology. It is necessary to comprehend these variations in order to diagnose and treat patients effectively.

292,"Yes, in a nutshell, generalized anxiety is longer-lasting throughout and does not have as severe anxiety as someone with panic disorder throughout the day, when it is active. The person worries excessively about several things, that most people wouldn’t. This can result in body aches, not being able to sleep, and problems with concentration. Some people do have panic attacks along with generalized disorder but most do not. It can result in trouble at school or work, daily activities, and it feels miserable to have.
Panic attacks are part of anxiety disorder, just because someone has a panic attack does not mean they have panic disorder. A person with a panic attack can have one that seems to come out of nowhere or it can be a result of being exposed to something similar to which they had their last panic attack. A panic attack is supposed to last 15–20 minutes but varies per person. The person feels extreme fear and sometimes like they are going crazy or are doomed. They usually have four or more symptoms like shivering, rapid heartbeat, chest constriction, feeling like they can’t breathe, numb or tingling arms and fingers, etc. They also can have feelings of depersonalization or derealization. The feeling often feels like how one would feel if they were hiding under the bed and a murderer meant to do them harm is in the room looking for them.
Panic disorder happens because the attacks feel so terrible that people fear having them again. You did not ask for a description. On both of the disorders, medical causes and medications causing the problem have to be ruled out before a diagnosis is given.",GAD
293,"Is This a Panic Attack or General Anxiety?
Not all anxiety is the same. This checklist can help you determine what’s happening before you talk to your doctor.
Everyone gets anxious from time to time, like before a big job interview, finding out test results or buying a new house.
“Feeling anxious or worried is a part of everyday life,” says Jonathan S. Wong, PsyD, a clinical psychologist at Keck Medicine of USC and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of USC. “It’s a normal human reaction to care about something important to us.”
But for nearly 13 million Americans who have panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), these feelings turn into extreme worry or fear — even when there’s no real cause for concern. Here’s how to tell the difference between the two.
1. Always worrying versus sudden fear
One key difference between GAD and panic disorder is the speed at which things develop and the pattern of behaviors that follows, Wong explains.
“GAD is about anticipating something bad happening in the future,” he says. “Things may be going okay right now, but you believe this won’t last, which puts you in a constant state of feeling tense and on edge, both psychologically and physically.”
This constant worry then results in behaviors that are meant to prevent a future threat from happening. For example, you may plan excessively, worry about unknown details or constantly check to see whether the feared situation has begun to occur.
On the other hand, having a sudden surge of fear, anxiety or worries about being safe — or even dying — is typical for panic disorder.
“If you have panic disorder, you attempt to change or escape the immediate situation when you feel a surge of fear, and you have a persistent worry that future panic attacks can happen at any moment,” he adds.
2. Ongoing versus acute physical symptoms
With GAD, you may have trouble concentrating, feel restless, twitch or tremble, find it hard to swallow, tire easily and sweat or feel light-headed on an ongoing basis. You may have headaches, muscle aches or stomachaches. And you may even realize that you worry far more than you should.
Although some symptoms of the two conditions are similar, those of panic disorder come on suddenly and intensely, and for no apparent reason. Your heart might pound so hard you could think you're having a heart attack, and you might sweat profusely and feel as though you’re unable to breathe. Stomach or chest pain, chills and dizziness can also begin without warning. But after a few minutes of these severe symptoms, they’ll subside.
3. Prolonged unease versus distress over when the next attack will strike
Both GAD and panic disorder may cause you to avoid situations and places where you’ve had these bad feelings. With GAD, you might not take advantage of job opportunities, trips or social events that you think will be too difficult for you. Even everyday situations, such as chores or appointments, can seem daunting. In this way, GAD negatively affects your quality of life.
But with panic disorder, the uncertainty of not knowing when the next attack will happen can be debilitating. This dread can lead to the development of further anxiety disorders, such as agoraphobia, or fear of leaving the house.
What to do if you think you have GAD or panic disorder
Luckily, anxiety disorders like GAD and panic disorder are very treatable.
“The majority of people who experience these disorders are able to reduce or eliminate symptoms after several months of psychotherapy, or even after just a few sessions,” Wong says. “Scientific research supports a combination of psychotherapy and medication, or psychotherapy alone, as ways to treat GAD and panic disorder.”
If you think you may have an anxiety disorder, speaking to a doctor or mental health professional is key and a great first step toward getting help, Wong adds.",GAD
294,"Just speaking from a perspective of someone who is diagnosed with both, the feeling they give off is somewhat similar but also distinctively different.
To start off on the easier end, GAD feels like what it stands for, anxiety. But not just any types and forms of anxiety, you just feel anxious day to day. It can range from intense anxiety from ordering to completely immobilised, but it is still anxiety. You're somewhat able to rationalise that it is NOT EXACTLY dangerous but you're not comfortable, I'd best explain it to be a situation of going for a huge presentation but it's an every minute every second for almost the entire day.
Panic disorder on the other hand, it feels out of YOUR control. It feels like everything is spiralling and you're in somewhat of an immediate danger, basically a panic attack. But not when it happens so frequently that you fear for the next one. From personal experience, its not just the panic attack that scares me but the fear or something happening while having panic attack so, its a pretty bad situation. My panic episodes also accompanies with flashbacks of traumatic events so it is also the fear of it happening at the same time/reliving the memories of it again. Best way to describe it would be a roller coaster ride but you have no safety precautions on and you can't see the roller coaster tracks.
I have been clinically diagnosed with both as well as a couple few but distinctively, social anxiety. By social anxiety, I'm referring to the constant anxiety feeling of being judged badly, and accompanied with paranoia of people jumping onto me which encourages more anxiety. I get anxious just about everything but that makes it worsen and in the situation of the paranoia strengthening, it creates somewhat of the same feeling of a panic attack. But when that feeling doesn't subside after moving to an extremely safe place (E.g a corner with my back against a wall and I can see everything), that's somewhat how I'd know it's the start of a panic attack. So after all of it is finished, I'd start prepping myself for the next one (I have at least 3–4 a day, sometimes 5) so I'd do things like prepping the area, having my meds and water ready, prepping mentally for it, going extremely out the way to make sure that it will not have a chance to affect me as bad though it'll hit just as bad again so it's a constant cycle of it. At my worst point, I've avoided going outside completely and not eat, drink and sleep to avoid imaginary people jumping me while living with a boyfriend who works freelance and stays home with me. It doesn't just ends with my boyfriend but also even with staying with couple of friends who were all home and stayed with me everywhere, it never feels safe at all but that's not the case for GAD. For GAD, yes, it can range from somewhat of a disturbance to a full on immobilisation effect on people but you don't get the fear of it repeating again that you prepare intensively for it. Just like how panic episodes and anxiety episodes are somewhat similar but very distinctively different, GAD and panic disorder are also the same.
But again, this is personal experience and everyone feels it differently so just because I go through it like that, doesn't mean you may/may not have it.",GAD
295,"The symptoms common to anxiety or anxiety disorders in general include:
Difficulty sleeping
Feelings of nervousness, panic, fear, and unease
Muscle tightness
Dry mouth
Tingling or numbness in the hands or feet
Nausea
Dizziness
Unable to be calm or hold still
Sweaty or cold hands and/or feet
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
(Types of anxiety disorder are : panic disorder, specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). )
The diagnostic criteria for panic disorder are defined in the DSM-5. It is an anxiety disorder based primarily on the occurrence of panic attacks, which are recurrent and often unexpected.
In addition, at least one attack is followed by one month or more of the person fearing that they will have more attacks. This causes them to change their behavior, which often includes avoiding situations that might induce an attack.
It's important to note that a panic disorder diagnosis must rule out other potential causes for the panic attack or what feels like one.
The attacks are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (such as drug use or a medication) or a general medical condition.
The attacks are not better accounted for by another mental disorder. These may include a social phobia or another specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or separation anxiety disorder
According to DSM-5, a panic attack is characterized by sudden onset of fear and dread as well as four or more of the following symptoms:
Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering
A feeling of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint
Feelings of unreality (derealization) or being detached from oneself (depersonalization)
Fear of losing control or going crazy
Fear of dying
Numbness or tingling sensations (paresthesias)
Chills or hot flushes
DSM-5 Criteria for Diagnosing Panic Disorder",GAD
296,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder are distinct anxiety disorders. GAD is characterized by chronic and excessive worry or anxiety about various everyday events or activities, often without a specific trigger. People with GAD may experience symptoms like restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances.
On the other hand, Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks. These are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort, accompanied by physical symptoms like heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom. Panic attacks typically peak within minutes and can be so severe that they lead to significant distress and a fear of future attacks.
While both disorders involve anxiety, GAD is marked by persistent, generalized worry, whereas Panic Disorder is defined by the occurrence of intense, sudden panic attacks. If you or someone you know is struggling with these conditions, seeking professional help is important.

297,"When people refer to anxiety, they generally mean generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are two different disorders. The distinguishing symptom of generalized anxiety disorder is continuously feeling on edge and moderately anxious, often without a specific reason. Panic disorder involves shorter episodes of extremely intense anxiety (panic attacks), again, often without a particular cause or reason. Panic attacks can occur in GAD, but they are not a distinguishing symptom.
Both of these conditions are quite complex, and I would recommend further research.",GAD
298,"Panic disorder is one of many types of anxiety disorders. Other anxiety disorders are the following : PTSD, OCD, and GAD. (post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder).
Panic attacks are discrete events with a beginning, a middle and an end. Panic disorder is characterized by some amount of panic attacks. These attacks are disruptive to normal functioning and seem to happen “out of the blue.”
Anxiety is a response to a perceived stressor or threat. People who experience anxiety feels the symptoms in a gradual manner and they build up over a long time, sometimes minutes, hours or days.",GAD
299,"As someone who suffers from both, I’ll try to do my best to explain it.
Generalized anxiety disorder is the typical form that people think of when hearing the word “anxiety”. It’s just constantly feeling nervous and worried over anything and everything with no exact triggers. It’s when you wake up and you think “something bad’s going to happen today, I don’t know what, but it’ll happen”.
Panic disorder is when you’re prone to having panic attacks at random times, usually frequently.
You can have gad without having panic disorder and you can have panic disorder without having gad.",GAD
300,"I don’t know when I ever felt “normal” anxiety, but from what I’ve observed, it’s more reasonable than GAD-anxiety. A lot more.
The metaphor I like using (and I’ve seen around a lot) is that it’s like missing a step while climbing the stairs. Normal anxiety is panicking for a few seconds before you catch yourself; once your foot is on the next step, you sigh in relief and continue on, likely forgetting about it ten minutes later.
Generalized anxiety is when there is no other step and it feels like you’re falling forever, and it takes a while before you find your footing again as your brain is yelling at you that there will never be another step and you doomed yourself.
Normal anxiety is when you worry about sensible things; an exam, job interview, asking someone you like out for the very first time, things like that.
GAD is also worrying about those things, but everything is upped to 11,000. It’s slightly different for each person, but from my experience, I get nervous about tests and social groups the moment I learn about them. Everyday things that everyone goes through, I panic inside about all the ways it can go wrong. I can’t even play guessing games with my friends because I panic over nothing. The simple English class homework assignment that’s a page long? Takes me over two hours to do because I think there’s a trick question somewhere and “it can’t be this easy”.
The worst and most drastic difference between the two? Normal anxiety is temporary. GAD causes those who have it to often be on edge; I’d have trouble even staying outside on a windy, peaceful day because - true story - I’ll jump after hearing a leaf land on concrete. That wouldn’t register in a person’s mind if they didn’t have anxiety, besides maybe observing the leaf fall.
Another way to think of it is GAD is having a mental sonar radar always on. When there’s a sudden noise or something unexpected happens, there’s a red flashing “ping” on the radar. Everything in your body goes to Red Alert, and will continue until the source/reason of the suddenness is discovered and deemed harmless, then to wait until the nerves calm down from being frazzled.
I hope that all helps!",GAD
301,"Generalised anxiety disorder often means feeling anxious about many different things in your life. But a panic attack is debilitating, almost crippling when it hits you. I get chest pains & have trouble breathing, I shake & sweat uncontrollably, I HAVE to sit or lie down & I HAVE to remove myself from whatever it was that triggered the attack. If it was being in a crowd I need to withdraw to somewhere quiet -at times that has even meant shutting myself in the toilet until I can take my meds & have them take effect. A panic attack puts you into ‘fight or flight’ mode before you get chance to talk yourself out of that. With diagnosis & help including counselling &/or medication, U learned to get through my panic attacks without hospitalisation, but they still have the power to incapacitate me for awhile if I get frightened enough.",GAD
302,"Generalized anxiety disorder can also cause panic attacks. However, panic disorders cause recurring panic attacks that are followed by anxiety about the possibility of your next panic attack. Unlike general anxiety, panic disorders are centered on panic attacks that can have no apparent trigger. Individuals with GAD often describe themselves as lifelong worriers, and their tendency to worry is often so pronounced and persistent it is often and readily recognized by others as extreme or exaggerated.

303,"Panic disorder is a specific kind of anxiety disorder.
Anxiety can come in many different forms, and panic disorder is just one of them. Panic disorder is characterized by panic attacks, which is a sudden period of high-intensity anxiety usually lasting less than 1 hour.
It is possible to just have panic disorder, but most anxiety sufferers have more than one type of anxiety disorder, such as social anxiety, specific phobias or agoraphobia.",GAD
304,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
305,"You are asking to describe in words an experiential process. Even if there was someone articulate enough to do it, you would never be able to know if your understanding was anywhere close to accurate.
GAD is present at varying levels all the time, damaging cognition, quality of life, and corrupting experience.
Panic attacks are episodic and intense.
If you are bothered by thoughts or feelings you have sometimes talk about what makes you feel that way with someone emotionally mature. An objective point of view will help you put things into perspective.",GAD

307,"Anxiety disorder refers to a broad category of mental health disorders characterized by excessive and persistent feelings of fear, worry, and nervousness. It includes various specific disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, finances, and relationships. GAD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders and can also be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue.
Here are some key differences between anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder:
Scope of worry and anxiety: While anxiety disorder is a broad category that includes various specific disorders, GAD specifically refers to excessive worry and anxiety about multiple aspects of life.
2. Duration of symptoms: In order to be diagnosed with GAD, the individual must have experienced excessive worry and anxiety for at least six months.
3. Specific triggers: People with anxiety disorder may experience anxiety in response to specific triggers, such as social situations or specific objects or situations, while those with GAD may experience worry and anxiety without any specific trigger.
4. Physical symptoms: While both anxiety disorder and GAD can be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and restlessness, GAD is more likely to also include physical symptoms like fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
5. Impact on daily life: GAD can significantly impact an individual’s daily life, making it difficult to function and complete daily tasks, while anxiety disorder may have a more specific impact depending on the specific disorder.
6. Treatment: Both anxiety disorder and GAD can be treated with therapy and medication, but the specific treatment approach may differ depending on the individual’s symptoms and needs.

309,"Hi Peter,
For other readers, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions).
The difference in OCD and generalized anxiety is that OCD is completely based on taught impulsive behavior. Fears can also be based on taught impulsive behavior and/or can be stimulated by formulating fearful conscious thoughts to create new or follow fearful impulsive behavior.
Let’s handle this in simple and clear words to understand OCD and anxiety.
Conscious thoughts are thoughts you formulate in the present moment. You can choose to formulate negative thoughts which makes you fearful and you can choose to formulate positive thoughts which makes you fearless. Negative thoughts are Not good for you, others or Nature. Positive thoughts are good for you, AND others, AND Nature.
When you create negative thoughts, you experience negative emotions and have upset, bad and sad feelings. When you create positive thoughts, you experience positive emotions and have happy, good and great feelings.
What is a guidance of God for Man, to shift your thoughts from negative unto positive thoughts to feel happy and good again. To evolve in life.
Example, you walk alone in the dark through a forest. You can formulate thoughts like, something bad can happen, someone can rob me, a wild animal can attack me, a ghost can appear and scare me, etc. All these negative thoughts are fearful thoughts and shall create a fearful emotion and makes you feel upset, bad or sad. And doesn’t change the situation, in your panic and fearful thoughts, it can lead you to start to run in fear, to fall and hurting yourself by uncontrolled actions.
When you shift your conscious thoughts of negative into positive thoughts, you create fearless thoughts. You shift your focus from a negative expectation in a near future into confident, positive and fearless thoughts for your near future. For example, walking in the dark through a forest. You enjoy the conversations you had that night with others. You look forward to arrive home, you enjoy the forest at night in this different experience. You love the sounds of the forest. You trust your other senses helping you to find your path back home. You start to think about your future, your girlfriend. You make a game to stay on the path in the dark based on feeling and listening to the crunches of the little stones on the path, etc. You shall feel happy, good and fearless, because you chose to focus on positive conscious thoughts. If something negative would happen, you are fearless, calm and positive, to make right, loving and good decisions.
Subconscious thoughts.
Subconscious thoughts are created in your memory by focusing with emotion and/or repeating conscious thoughts in your life. Subconscious thoughts are connected by your synapses unto memory, belief system or even called your perspective at life. This is just the way we learn in life.
Everything you sense in life such as see, read, watch, hear, smell, taste and feel, are thoughts. What thoughts you repeatedly experience and focus on becomes subconscious thoughts in your memory.
Triggers
These subconscious thoughts in your mind are accessible by triggers. Triggers are also thoughts as pictures, events, letters, numbers, words, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, etc. Which are connected by synapses in your brain to other subconscious thoughts. When you hear a music, other thoughts which are connected by the synapses to subconscious thoughts, shall light up in your conscious Awareness and you shall remember other thoughts that are connected with this trigger of music. When you hear a word like Sun as a trigger, the most used synapses that is connected to the word, Sun, lights up in your conscious Awareness and shall be remembered. Sometimes when we think harder, we can even find the subconscious thoughts of weaker connected synapses. Subconscious thoughts and synapses, we did not use so much in life.
If we use a combination of two or more triggers at the same time, then the synapses that connects to subconscious thoughts together, light up in your memory. This is the way we can remember things in life and make sense in our thoughts.
In a human life we create, by formulating or experiencing conscious thoughts of ourselves, others or in life, our subconscious memory and personality.
Behavior
Behavior are the thoughts we have created in our memory as our perspective at life and we act accordingly on our thoughts.
We can act in the present moment on conscious thoughts, what means we decide with free will and choice in the present moment. What thoughts we formulate to think, how we like an experience in a present moment or what to do next, etc.
Our behavior can be expressed as an act or thought in a conscious or a subconscious way. A conscious way is to make a choice in life, that expresses our behavior. A subconscious way is to act impulsively, what expresses our impulsive behavior. Of course, most of conscious and subconscious ways are morphed together by Man and seems very complex and difficult. But, as you see, it doesn’t have to be this way.
For example. The most recognizable form of OCD, this type involves obsessions about things being in precisely the right place or symmetrical, to check or do something more fold, to be obsessive with dust, etc.
What happens here, is when someone starts to place something in a symmetrical way, and repeat this every day. What gives them a content controlling and satisfied feeling, then they repeat the same kind of conscious thoughts over and over again. What becomes their subconscious thoughts in their memory. When used often the synapses becomes stronger, as soon a situation is there, as a trigger, then automatically the own taught behavior is expressed impulsively.
People like to be controlling by Ego. When they have problems to control sometimes things in their lives, then they start to control small things. What makes them feel in control and what comforts them.
How more they repeat this behavior how stronger OCD becomes.
The same happens with fears, how more negative and fearful thoughts you formulate and repeat over and over again, you stimulate the synapses that holds these subconscious thoughts and shall at all kind of slightest triggers, light up in your conscious Awareness. And impulsively you feel instantly afraid. When someone constantly formulates fearful thoughts it can become an OCD. And instantly people can become afraid.
OCD is when someone is experiencing a trigger, the choice of formulating a positive or negative choice has disappeared. This person is not able to formulate conscious thoughts by free will anymore and solely act on subconscious thoughts impulsively. OCD is also found regular in anxious people, still not admitted by many. Anxious people who are not severely OCD can still make a choice by free will in certain situations to do something consciously differently, that opposes the need to follow fearful subconscious thoughts impulsively. All fears are still a form of OCD. If someone has OCD then they act solely impulsively every time a trigger activates negative and fearful behavior.
If you know how your mind works, you are able to dissolve OCD.
You have to let the person to make choices. To show the negative thoughts leading to negative consequences, and the positive thoughts leading to positive consequences. To let them be able to control their own thoughts again. This has to be step by step followed through.
For example.
When someone is afraid for spiders.
Then this person has formulated negative conscious thoughts in the past, and repeated them over and over again, with a bad experience that one spider bit them for example, or with watching, seeing, reading, thinking the same negative thoughts when seeing a spider.
Negative thoughts can be that this person is afraid to get hurt, to get bitten, or just say I think they are creepy, I don’t like them, I want to stay out of their way, I don’t want to see spiders, etc. These are all negative thoughts having negative emotions as a consequence.
What needs to be done is to restore Reality. To understand the differences of a spider and a Man. To understand as a Man you are in control in this case, you can keep your distance and nothing happens. To understand every life is valuable and important to have balance in life, etc.
Then this person have to make a list of positive thoughts about why they do not have to be afraid of spiders. When this person repeats this list of positive thoughts with positive and loving emotions over and over again, just by reading them. They create synapses in their mind that connects fearless thoughts with their believe system. And they learn not to be afraid anymore. It is as simple as written here. What you are doing here is to reprogram your synapses in your brain to connect other thoughts to your belief system you prefer in life. In previous answers I have given many examples in details how to work this out. For example look at many previous answers about dissolving fear for bugs, driving, depression, etc.
Fearful people or OCD people have to understand Not to think and formulate conscious anxious thoughts anymore. Otherwise they are just stimulating the synapses that holds these negative fearful subconscious thoughts and light up in their Conscious Awareness. When they do not use these negative fearful thoughts any more, they forget their fears. And even the synapses that connect these negative fearful subconscious thoughts to the trigger, to see a spider for example, shall disconnect.
This works the same to erase all negative emotions from your life. Imagine that if you don’t experience Any negative emotions or upset, bad or sad feeling in your life, then it gives room to be Happy in life. And I can tell you this true happiness from within feels GREAT and WONDERFUL.
Start with small steps to erase One negative emotion from your life and to learn to control your conscious thoughts with free will again. After a while you shall learn you can overrule all subconscious thoughts that let you impulsively think or act negatively, with choosing conscious thoughts you prefer in life. In Every situation in life you have a CHOICE, to formulate thoughts you prefer. Learn to become Master of your thoughts and feelings again. What is all based on very ancient Wisdom of right human relations. Believe it or not, still it is true. Only by trying and doing the effort you shall see it works, it works and it works.
Life is all about thoughts and choices.

310,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious.

312,"Thank you, Jo, for the question.
I have self-diagnosed myself as suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, more than likely developing as early as when I was a 4th grade student of 9 years of age.
If I did poorly on a test…ANY test…I became deeply troubled I was going to flunk the 4th grade…then the 5th grade…then the 6th grade…and so on. I was a nervous wreck bringing my sealed report card home to Mom and Dad.
Even when I was at university, I studied as if my very life depended upon how well I did. I was convinced I was unworthy of admission to university.
As a result of my nervousness, my anxiety, my feelings of inadequacy, I literally buried myself in my studies ALL the time.
True enough, I graduated with Honors in the top 10% of the School of Arts and Sciences. Yet, the ONLY reason I did so well academically…was my continuous fear I was going to flunk out,
I was always hoping, if I tried just a little harder than the next guy…maybe I could eke out a graduation…by the skin of my teeth.
My personal philosophy of life is, “If it can happen to anybody…it’s GOING to happen to me…unless it’s something good like winning the lottery, or something.” Another personal philosophy is, “Life isn’t what I make of it…it’s what OTHER people allow me to experience.” Lastly, “I am neither a cup half full nor a cup half empty fellow. Most of the time, I don’t think I even HAVE a cup.”
I continually worry about everyone and everything…knowing full well that worrying never solved even one problem.
Therefore, speaking on a personal basis, I am suffering from the effects of this pandemic, the lockdowns, the self-imposed isolation, the quarantine. I think I miss people a lot more than do some other folks.
I have found myself getting into my car and driving around town…just to SEE people…a man walking his dog…a family of four riding their bicycles…a woman loading groceries into her car.
Sometimes, I just NEED to see other people doing the normal things they would normally be doing, under normal circumstances.
When this pandemic is declared to be officially over, I swear I’m going to run outside…and hug somebody.
I miss people…a lot.
I hope you have a pleasant evening, my friend.",GAD

314,"Yes. The stupid part is to have anxiety or depression. Heal it and it won’t suffer any more!
Depression is the result of you making a choice —mostly unconsciously— to live in the past. You think that the past is safer because you know it. But the past is gone, is memories, is death… and you end the same… death… depressed.
Anxiety is the result of you making a choice —mostly unconsciously— to live in the future. You think that “If a get the new job I’ll be rich,” ”If she loves me, I’ll be happy.” But the future doesn’t exist yes, and you fear that you won’t be neither rich nor happy… and get anxious.
To get rid of depression or anxiety make a new choice —that time consciousliy— to live in the present. To live in the present, feel your body. Your body is always in the present!
The only thing that we have is the present. Past is gone, it’s memories; learn from it. Future is still to come; we don’t even know if we’ll be here when it comes.
The first thing that you must do is clean up all the blocked emotions and stress that you have —we all have— in your heart. Those are like ‘coloured glasses’ that tint everything we see and feel. They are, also, the way our mind controls us.
Then, you fill your heart with your own love, your own trust, and your own appreciation. You are the only one that can fill your heart. Nothing external will do. You’ll become responsible of your life and happiness.
You find your inner place of peace and joy. And intuition is developed. You’ll know from deep inside yourself all the answers —and the questions!— that you need to know.
To attain that, I use deep meditation. I use the Isha system.
Deep meditation means to let your thoughts pass by and give guidance of your life to your heart. You become responsible of your life and happiness. You find your inner place of peace and joy. And develop intuition.
Emotions are like water: if they flow, they are clear and healthy; if they stagnate, they root. So, let them flow. Just choose the right place to do that. Never in the face of another person, just in a matrix or pillow.",GAD

Not being able to socialize with friends and family members.

319,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.

323,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

326,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
327,"As a student of psychology and chronically depressed person myself, I pride myself as a qualified candidate for your answer.
There is a HUGE connection between pre existing mental health conditions, personality and even genetics with acquirement of depression. It is said that a person who had depression in her/his genes inherently have the capacity to become depressed, which is sometimes triggered in later life to give rise to depression. These events/triggers are often called “diathesis” and is one of the main postulates of “diathesis stress” model. Also, according to the psychologists Friedmann and Rosenmann, there is a variant of personality called “Type - D” which is prone to depression. However, all these aside, I will say that not only mental health issues but also physical health issues contribute to depression.
To say the truth, depression in like fever. Just like we have fever every time there is something wrong with our body, we fall into depression the moment something triggers our mental health. Thus, getting depressed is our body’s way to communicating that something is off with your mental health.
Now if I address the panic and anxiety many people suffered from in the pandemic, it is a very special psychological disorder called ‘illness anxiety disorder.’ It is triggered by the fact that many people around me are suffering or even dying from this particular disease and I may have it too. It is very common among elderly people, and it really reached a new height during covid-19 pandemic. As I have mentioned earlier, depression is a common symptom of almost all anxiety related disorders, and this one is no exception. However, not all people who suffered from IAD during the pandemic had pre existing psychological disorders. It was just a response to the panicky atmosphere that they lived in.
I hope I satisfied your curiosity.

330,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.

332,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.

333,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.

334,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
335,"your daily Stress may lead to restlessness, irritability, lack of sleep, constant worry and anxiety. These could be signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Living with anxiety might be difficult but there are various self-help guidance techniques that can be practiced for the well-being of an individual. These include:
Social interaction: A support system plays an important role to overcome GAD Social interaction with people who can be trusted is effective in calming the nervous system thus reducing anxiety. It could be a family member or friend. Build a strong social network and interact to avoid being in isolation. Avoid situations or people who make you feel negative or anxious.
Lifestyle modifications: These changes include change in the sleep pattern, diet, regular exercises, limiting the intake of alcohol and caffeine.

336,"Thanks for the A2A.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.

Meditation helps me slow down and focus on taking deep breaths, in through the nose, hold for a few seconds and release it. Doing this over and over for the length of time I choose my meditation teaches me how to acknowledge my thoughts then let them go, each time bringing them back to the breath.

342,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body.

347,"I am a chemical engineer suffering from anxiety probably since early childhood. I can think of several ways how the condition negatively affected me - development of my personality, my relationships (being completely shy and withdrawn around girls) and my physical health. And I can witness that meds (SSRI in my case) significantly improved quality of my life. Please give it a try.
As for the brain chemistry alteration, please note that these meds don’t “add” chemicals to your brain but prevent your brain from decomposing the serotonin.
Don’t go into the “hard” antidepressants that kick in immediately. As far as I understand it these should be used only in severe cases (e.g. tendency to commit suicide).
And if you decide to start with SSRI (with guidance of your psychiatrist of course) give them time of at least one month to make effect. In the beginning your condition might get worse and sleep disorders are almost sure thing. But the positive effects outweigh the negative.
Which are the positive effects?
Better mood, feeling more “myself”, better recognition of automatic negative thoughts and ability to work with them, better social interaction, improved ability to focus at work.",GAD
348,"The right treatment can often improve GAD. You and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both.
Taking Medicine
Your provider may prescribe one or more medicines, including:
An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks or months to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD.
A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. However, benzodiazepines can become less effective and habit forming over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work.
When taking medicine for GAD:
Keep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead.
Do not change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider.
Take medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine.
Ask your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur.
Therapy
Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it.
Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often, CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:
Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.
Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.
Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.
Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.
Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.

351,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
352,"I feel like a lot of parents say no but honestly phones. I read to help me escape but if you want to make friends the easiest way would be start small. Find One person you feel comfortable with and spend time with them getting to know them talking more, and then slowly add another person into your group someone or you also feel like you can trust and that you’re comfortable with. Continue this cycle and slowly start adding people that you generally enjoy this will help you socialize more and be less anxious in public. But if you don’t wanna do that I very highly recommend using your phone as a crutch, when you’re in public and don’t feel safe or you feel like people are watching your phone is a very good option to help relieve that feeling",GAD
353,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
354,"I totally understand. If you're seeking natural alternatives, I would definitely try mediation. YouTube has some really great guided imagery meditations. Also, carve out time to get out in nature and away from electronics. It's a cliché, but nature is the best medicine. Also maybe try writing out your anxieties/thoughts/feelings on a daily basis. It will help to clear your head when you feel overwhelmed or anxious.",GAD
355,"Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed on a non-binary criteria. Rather than looking at Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) as serious or non-serious, it would be best to approach this with, quite simply: It depends. GAD can absolutely be serious, yes, but as will all other illnesses of this variety, the seriousness of each diagnosis falls under either a mild, moderate, or severe categorization. Therefore, some instances of GAD are more serious than others.
Some with GAD can typically go about their daily routine without much impairment, but experience an ever-present feeling of intense worry over every little thing. Just because they can function, does not necessarily mean its easy to do so, or that they are not in need of help. A case like this would be considered more on the mild side because of the ability to function.
Then there are cases where people’s lives start to slip from their fingers because of how bad the anxiety is. They are failing in their academics, their jobs are in jeopardy, relationships are becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, the list goes on. An impairment to this degree is more on moderate - severe.
Treatments vary wildly depending on the individual. Some respond best to psychotherapy, to medication, or even to a combination of the two. There is no set answer there since everybody is different.

356,"As has been answered: yes.
When I was younger and totally oblivious to what was wrong with me. I never heard of “generalized anxiety disorder” back in the 80’s. Or even knew I was anxious, for that matter.
Personally, my untreated anxiety morphed into something uglier. It started with Intrusive thought - Wikipedia. Very disturbing images that made me believe I’d gone “crazy.” Eventually it turned into Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (different than OCD, but they share some of the same traits: OCD vs OCPD: Symptoms and Treatments.)
My therapist (I didn’t start until my 40’s) wasn’t fond of DSMV descriptions of many personality disorders. With a few notable exceptions (schizophrenia, for example,) she firmly believed that at the root of most mental illness were anxiety and/or depression (two sides of the same coin to her.)
In a short period of time, she helped me to strip away most of the extreme effects of OCPD. (An interesting side note: she never once mentioned “OCPD,” but after I read about it, there was no doubt that’s what I had.) There’s no “cure” for OCPD, I’m still a perfectionist … but most symptoms disappeared.
Which left my anxiety exposed, naked and quivering, treated with psychotherapy and SSRI’s.",GAD

358,"Yes, if it is not treated. 'treated' is meant to include medication and/or therapy and acceptance. In fact, medication does not treat GAD but only helpful in controlling it. Benzodiazepines and SSRIs which are normally prescribed for GAD may help you to stabilize and get time to recover, but discontinuation of medication has few undesired effects, ironically one of them is recurrence of anxiety.
The better option is to first accept that you have GAD (generally, it is hard to accept you have any psychological disorder). Acceptance if the first step to the recovery. Then, psychotherapy coupled with your willingness for betterment can help you to recovery easily. Meanwhile, you can take medications during recovery period.
What if GAE is not treated? Generally, if GAD is related to specific situation of the life, it will get better with time if the worrying situation ceased to exit. But if one has GAD for a longer period, it would become one's mind pattern to feel anxious. One would slowly learn to be anxious in any new situation. Putting in simple words, practicing singing daily makes to a good singer and practicing specific work daily makes you expert in that thing, practicing anxiety daily makes you to be anxious in daily life. This intensifies with the time. It also begin to affect you health (physical). It makes family life and work hard and stressful. Your energy is consumed in being anxious and you have little energy to live life.

359,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD

361,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
363,"Yes.
I personally overcame a GAD (which started with several panic attacks at night); 3 doctors told me that, given the severity of symptoms, in my case it would be impossible to overcome this without antidepressants & sleeping pills first… and they were wrong. I was personally convinced that it was possible not to take these drugs but one told me “you know all patients think they can overcome this but it’s a lure, they’re not doctors they don’t know…”. I’ve literally spent 4 months through hell: recurring panic attacks, 3 hours of sleep nightly, debilitating pains the back that made it impossible to concentrate at work, I had the productivity of a 12-year-old child… But I studied the topic of anxiety and depression and I came to realize 2 things:
Our doctors with 10 years of studies aren’t so smart as they think about this issue, they just prescribe pills that they know “work” which means it hides the symptoms for most people (after trying 2, 3 for many of them) but don’t cure the root cause of anxiety. At best it will break a vicious circle, but your body is a very sensitive system and putting in something that will play with your neurotransmitters for 6-month will obviously alter something in your brain.
Mental disorders are more than we think an organic disease (such as liver cirrhosis for an alcoholic) than “psychological” diseases related to the way we think, childhood memories etc. (Doctors are behaving like all mental disorders are genetic or caused by a psychological trauma but it’s not always the case and in fact I would think that in the majority of cases people develop mental problems due to poor lifestyle which range from unhealthy diet to stressful jobs, toxic people, even heavy metals intoxication: I know this one is crazy but check Doctor’s Mark Hyman videos on YouTube you will see it’s true for thousands of people)
So now let’s do a quick summary of how I did it:
Never take benzos, I took them at first (Xanax) and it worsened the situation so badly, withdrawal was so hard. The only thing I took that was beneficial was Atarax (1st gen antihistaminic), it has a calming effect, helps sleep a little bit but nothing compared to a benzo, and it’s not addictive. BENZOS ARE DANGEROUS DRUGS, to me their effects were 5x more powerful than what I ever experienced with anything else, I couldn’t imagine something that was prescribed by a doctor could actually be a drug more dangerous than some illegal drugs… But it is.
Take time off (like 1-2 month) if your job is stressful in order to concentrate on healing your disease. But see people, friends, family, even animals, it’s key to healing.
HEAL YOUR BRAIN BY HEALING YOUR BODY FIRST. THE SAME THINGS THAT MAKE US SICK ALSO MAKE US ANXIOUS. Anxiety disorder is when anxiety is present everywhere without even being triggered by a negative thought. It’s clearly a brain dysfunction, you have to heal it. In my case it was not because I had bad thoughts that it triggered anxiety feeling in my body, anxiety feelings in my body did trigger bad thoughts. My body had become sick because of months of bad habits. For me that first horrible panic attack started after 4 months of hard partying every friday, saturday, + stressful job with late hours (1–2 in the morning), my body was completely exhausted and sick but I didn’t want to believe it.
Very short term: try soft medicine: acupuncture and hypnosis worked really well for me, but with reliable practitioners not some king of gurus
Short: STOP ALCOHOL, COFFEE AND REFINED SUGAR. You’ll probably be craving all of them for 2 weeks but after this you’ll REALLY feel better. Stop any other excitants if you’re taking them (ginseng etc.). Once you’ve recovered, limit your alcohol consumption to the bare minimum, it’s toxic for your brain.
Short (2 weeks to see the first effects), medium & long term: completely change the way you eat, eat organic food, lots of veggies, fruits, omega-3 fatty acids; add probiotics, vitamins, magnesium & zinc to your diet if necessary, food is the key to healing tons of chronic diseases for which we wrongly use antidepressants (IBS, fybromalgia, depression, anxiety… and even some autoimmune diseases)
Practice sport regularly (3, 4 times a week) but don’t get too hard on you in a time you’re really exhausted. It’s not the right moment to do an iron man.
And? It’s about everything. Another important one is to believe in god and do the good around you.
If you’re really to the point where you tried all this above and it doesn’t work, take ADs to break this vicious circle but still keep all those good habits above so you won’t relapse after stopping the medication. It’s not a shame to suffer from anxiety or depression, we all have to face our own issues, for some it’s obesity, others it’s diabete, for us it’s anxiety. Even if as you can read I don’t trust the pharmaceutical industry (their goal is to make money by selling the most medications as possible, the more side effects the more additional medications to sell) and I think doctors’ arrogance makes them blind about this plague, don’t waste the most beautiful years of your life fighting a disease. If after months and months of all what I told above you still have the problem (which I believe is unlikely though), go seek medication, it probably means your anxiety is related to something else. And as I told above, Atarax worked for me with almost no withdrawal symptoms (but its effect is mild)

364,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.

368,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves persistent worry and anxiety about various aspects of life. Its impact can be significant, affecting daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being. Understanding the severity of GAD is essential for seeking appropriate treatment and support. For more information on anxiety disorders, visit my Quora Profile on Mental Health.",GAD
369,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
370,"Very hard to know if generalized anxiety disorder can be learned. I have my doubts. But this is what helicopter parenting does.
A child who has overprotective parents will not learn to trust themselves. They may struggle in life learning how to be independent when perhaps it is better learned in early teenage years. They learn distorted fears from their parents. Catastrophic thinking in the parents is adopted by the kid through just trying to be like their parents. All kids try to be like their parents except where there is pain in doing so. Then they want to be the opposite of the parents. Parents in general expect their kids to “be” like them. This is so dumb. An offspring of two parents will be a unique individual. Their inability to “be” what their parents instruct? Results in feelings of inadequacy. And loss of self worth. Leave them alone. Let them do things for themselves instead of solving all their needs for them by guesswork. They know everything the need to know almost by 12 these days. All the lecturing you put into “teaching”? It is natural for them to ignore you when they start puberty. You are wasting your breath. Let your kid be unique in the way they want to be. Not the way you want them to be. Accept as is. As long as you have taught morals and good choices vs bad? They can figure alot our on their own. Give them some trust so they feel capable of doing it on their own. Mommy and daddy may still be around at 18, but their work is done quite earlier than they realize.",GAD
371,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
372,"Yes. Here’s how it works. Anxiety generally leads to avoidance. So if you’re scared of failing at your job, you’ll avoid your job. Avoidance leads to self guilt. So now you’re upset at yourself for failing to do your job. Self-guilt reinforces the anxiety. Because now the the thing you’re afraid of is scarier than it was before. Now, you’re afraid of your job and you hate yourself for it. This goes in a downwards cycle of anxiety and self-guilt until you end up both terrified and filled with self-loathing.",GAD
373,"There are some good answers here but as someone who is diagnosed with GAD I wanted to make a clarification. When people say anxiety is uncontrolled worry, it’s not like you are consciously realizing something as stressful and so you are worried about it. It’s not like “Oh, I’m worried I did that wrong” it doesn’t come from rational thought. GAD for me is just sort of there like a layer on top of my personality. So I am me and can act accordingly but in the background everything is stressing me out. Sometimes it’s less sometimes it more. Occassionally for whatever reason I have a day where the background stress is overwhelming and I can’t overcome it. These are days I usually have to call out of work. I mean every morning is a struggle, but some days it’s not a struggle I can win. As for how it feels physically, you know that feeling you get when you suddenly hear something really bad. Where it feels like your soul just drops out of your body and you don’t quite know how to comprehend what you’ve just heard. Thats what GAD feels like for me, in the background of my mind all day everyday, like someone is telling me really bad news constantly. Thats on medication. Without medication I have many days where I do not function. I developed GAD after as a result of my brother passing away. Prior to that I was a strong minded, confident, assertive man. I don’t know what I am anymore.",GAD
374,"When I’m nervous it is definitely with a reason- I get nervous when I interview for a job, I get nervous when I have to ask a big question, I get nervous talking to my boss- all are regular and alleviated within seconds of doing the act I am in fear of.
When I get anxious, it isn’t as simple. Anxiety creeps up sometimes on a car ride and somehow I feel like breathing is the most difficult thing that I need to actively think about to calm down- but it doesn’t calm me down.
I can be stuck in my tracks and get light headed and physically ill being anxious and needing to escape somewhere- but no where feels entirely the answer. It makes me physically shake and tremble and I get moderately nauseous and dizzy, so I try to excuse myself to the restroom or somewhere to lay down. But anxiety, definitely doesn’t have a reason , sometimes my body’s chemistry goes into overdrive on adrenaline and I get really worked up, and I can’t calm it down immediately.

375,"I’ll use a scenario that I experienced last year which explains this, at least for me.
A close friend of mine invited me to a video-game lock in at our school, and I’m all hyped for it. The teacher hosting the lock-in got tons of pizza, doughnuts, soda, and all the sweets someone with a sweet-tooth could ask for. I hang out with my friend and tag along with him whenever I can. Feelings of being clingy start rising, but it doesn't change me getting “drunk” from Sprite (aka so hyper that I start acting like I’m drunk even though I don’t drink alcohol.) I’m alert to my surroundings, staying in the sidelines and out of everyone’s way, often keeping a chair available nearby.
A couple hours pass by and I’m watching my friend play Smash Bros with other people. I’m a blanket burrito and keep the blanket tightly wrapped around me, feelings of security finally reaching me. It’s around midnight now, so I decide to do something I’d never do; lay down on the floor, using my arm as a pillow, and rest.
Next thing I know, one of my friend’s other friends stood above me, a huuuuuuuge grin on his face as others gather around and start giggling. I’m half-awake and my brain is scattering for answers of what that familiar marker smell was. The guy held up a mirror and the reflection slapped me awake.
Sharpie. I got Jigglypuffed (my face was drawn on while I passed out, the term is an inside joke to Pokemon).
My whole body flushed and I retreated into my fluffy security blanket, terrified of what was happening. Ashamed that I let myself do such a thing. There was black marks all over my face from the marker, I had no idea I fell asleep. My friend came over and tried his best to get me out of it, but I was already escaping into my own world away from the now loud and blurry party.
Some time later, I finally calm down after going outside and getting some fresh air, but I don’t stop throwing death glares at the guy who drew on my face while I was passed out and vulnerable. My stomach starts doing flips inside me as I catch my breath, feeling the tingling feeling slowly going away from my legs and fingers.
After an hour or so, I regain my composure and return back to the party, still keeping the blanket wrapped around me. I go back to the spot and both my friend and Mr. Evil are playing games. I spend some of the time giving him death glares (which he did comment on and my friend explained that now would not be the best time to talk to me. Wise choice.)
To my surprise, I ended up falling asleep again. Likely from being exhausted from the previous anxiety attack. With my friend being a barrier between me and Mr. Evil, safety slowly got me to sleep a couple more hours. I woke up again and no marker smell. Instead, something much worse.
As soon as I woke up, I jumped up and sprinted across the crowded room and quickly shut the door behind me as I went outside. Even though I don’t remember having a nightmare, my instincts told me that it was not safe in there and I made a grave mistake. I felt nauseous as hell, even though I didn’t eat much. My lungs felt clogged, like there was a boulder on my chest. I can’t breathe. I can’t see well. I cannot cough up what is making me sick. I prayed that no-one saw me or made fun of me behind my back for sitting on the edge of the stairwell in the 50 degree weather with only a blanket to keep her warm. Too many feelings to count swarmed me all at once, mostly rage and shame. To this day, I have no freaking clue why I did that.
The feelings remained for the rest of the lock-in. I stayed outside, unable to go back in without getting an overwhelming force try to push me back outside, back to ‘safety’. Or else something just as bad as the Sharpie incident would happen again.
I ended up having to go home a little early, and my friend helped me over to my mom’s car. I made sure with him that I wasn’t a burden to him or anyone else. I was miserable for weeks after that.
I know it sounds more like social anxiety, but imagine situations like that happening for a wide variety of things, including everyday things like eating and simply moving from Point A to Point B, even within your own home. I’m alert of my surroundings 24/7, very rarely getting a break. The slightest sound can make me jump.
Here’s a few pictures that I often go back to whenever someone asks the same question you have:
And to sum it all up:",GAD
376,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
377,"Yes, panic attacks can be very much a part of general anxiety disorder.
If you were to consider the symptoms of anxiety as an orchestra, the panic attack would be the crescendo at the finale.
That being said, you can suffer from GAD and not have panic attacks or you can suffer panic attacks (panic disorder) and not have GAD. Complicated creatures, aren’t we?
Another dilemma that GAD sufferers have is that once they have experienced the hell of a panic attack, they tend to panic about becoming panicked. Which only creates more panic.
A horrible vicious cycle that must be broken by conquering your fears of anxiety symptoms and then digging deep to find the root cause of your anxiety as a whole.",GAD
378,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
379,"Indeed they can. Anything can set off a generally anxious person to go into a full-blown panic attack.
These types of individuals have overactive and hypersensitive nervous systems. Their stress-tolerance may be lower than the average person's.
Someone is diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when they feel anxious for no reason. Sure, certain circumstances in their life might not be ideal. They might have financial issues, maybe they're in some credit card debt, and find it hard to pay it off. Maybe they are having relationship issues. Maybe they have a general malaise and apathy towards life — more of an existential coming to terms with meaning and impermanence type of thing.
Whatever the case, yes → they may develop triggers that form panic attacks and then the panic attacks make everything feel threatening.
It’s learning how to control perspective and shift into states of mindfulness that really help with panic attacks → unlike hyperventilating, deep breathing helps tremendously quell all symptoms of panic and anxiety by shifting the body into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state.
Other things that help reset and or strengthen the resilience of the nervous system towards stress, thereby combating generalized anxiety and the resulting panic attacks are things such as hormetic stressors, adaptogens, and mindfulness practices:
Cold showers
Saunas
Physical activity
Mushrooms
Meditation
Grounding
Breathwork
Yoga, Qi Gong, Tai-Chi
Journaling
Green Tea

My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
382,"Absolutely.
Some people with GAD or other anxiety spectrum illnesses do not have panic attacks on a regular basis, but some of them have multiple panic attacks a day. Some clinicians like to term the latter out as ""GAD with panic attacks"" or some other more doctory sounding phrasing, but having Panic Disorder, is not required to have panic attacks.
Panic Disorder is about panic attacks that are not known to be situational or triggered by very specific contexts or mental processes. Panic attacks can occur in any psychiatric diagnosis (including things like depression, schizophrenia, personality disorders, etc), and also in normal people---many normal people experience at least one panic attack sometime in their lives.
In my lay opinion (as an anxiety sufferer who has also been friends with many fellow anxiety patients), the more comprehensive your chronic anxiety is, the more likely you are to experience panic attacks because of it. If you forcibly try to keep an OCD person from performing a compulsion, they can have a panic attack, but when you have more pervasive anxiety contexts like in many cases of Social Anxiety Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder, the capacity to be triggered and ability to manage or avoid those triggers can often be exponentially diminished.
Of course, alternatively, OCD can be pretty comprehensive, and sometimes SAD or GAD are lower level occurrences or simply do not manifest with persistent episodes of panic attacks. Terminologically speaking, anxiety and panic are not the same experience or neurochemical process, but there is some crossover and not everyone will use either word in the same manner. The important thing is to find what phrasing best communicates your own experiences to the people you are discussing with, be they friends, family, coworkers, strangers, or professionals.",GAD
383,"It is not unusual for people suffering with G.A.D. to notice panic attacks. However, having panic attacks is not a requirement to be diagnosed with G.A.D.

Elevators were a big NO. I’d be talking to someone and one would come on. Now that I’m properly medicated I can fight them. I still feel them coming on but they go away. I figured out my triggers were not being able to leave a situation. So I talk myself down BEFORE I get into one. Some catch me off guard, like seeing someone on the market who wants to talk but now I can handle that. So yes they can come out of nowhere but with therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) and/or meditation they are manageable.",GAD

389,"Yes, in a nutshell, generalized anxiety is longer-lasting throughout and does not have as severe anxiety as someone with panic disorder throughout the day, when it is active. The person worries excessively about several things, that most people wouldn’t. This can result in body aches, not being able to sleep, and problems with concentration. Some people do have panic attacks along with generalized disorder but most do not. It can result in trouble at school or work, daily activities, and it feels miserable to have.
Panic attacks are part of anxiety disorder, just because someone has a panic attack does not mean they have panic disorder. A person with a panic attack can have one that seems to come out of nowhere or it can be a result of being exposed to something similar to which they had their last panic attack. A panic attack is supposed to last 15–20 minutes but varies per person. The person feels extreme fear and sometimes like they are going crazy or are doomed. They usually have four or more symptoms like shivering, rapid heartbeat, chest constriction, feeling like they can’t breathe, numb or tingling arms and fingers, etc. They also can have feelings of depersonalization or derealization. The feeling often feels like how one would feel if they were hiding under the bed and a murderer meant to do them harm is in the room looking for them.
Panic disorder happens because the attacks feel so terrible that people fear having them again. You did not ask for a description. On both of the disorders, medical causes and medications causing the problem have to be ruled out before a diagnosis is given.",GAD
390,"Absolutely.
Someone with anxiety has anxiety attacks, whether regularly or just at stressful situations and/or specific triggers. But if something happens that completely overwhelms them, they can easily have a panic attack. People who don't have anxiety at all can have panic attacks too.",GAD
391,"Do people with generalized anxiety disorder have panic attacks?
Thanks for the a2a.
Basically the answer is always yes. I mean I gave myself a panic attack just to avoid a nervous breakdown but you're just playing with time.",GAD
392,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long. Just annoyed and upset, and that’s perfectly fine!",GAD
393,"Yes it’s possible. In my case, when I was young I used to get panic attacks but now when i’m having a relapse of anxiety, it’s a very high one but not to the point of having a panic attacks. It’s much much longer !",GAD
394,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
395,"Generalised anxiety disorder often means feeling anxious about many different things in your life. But a panic attack is debilitating, almost crippling when it hits you. I get chest pains & have trouble breathing, I shake & sweat uncontrollably, I HAVE to sit or lie down & I HAVE to remove myself from whatever it was that triggered the attack. If it was being in a crowd I need to withdraw to somewhere quiet -at times that has even meant shutting myself in the toilet until I can take my meds & have them take effect. A panic attack puts you into ‘fight or flight’ mode before you get chance to talk yourself out of that. With diagnosis & help including counselling &/or medication, U learned to get through my panic attacks without hospitalisation, but they still have the power to incapacitate me for awhile if I get frightened enough.",GAD

397,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.

General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.

It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!

That could take a few months, but it is more likely to take a decade or so. Some people may stay on medications for the rest of their lives.
The harder you work to learn how to handle your GAD without medication, the sooner you will be able to stop taking meds. However, I think you can expect that the process of learning how to manage your own recovery will take at least five to ten years if you work hard at it and have a lot of hope that you will be able to learn how to cope. If you have less hope and faith in yourself, it will take longer, and you may never be able to feel like you can handle your life without meds. Hope and faith in self can be learned, and it is very common to start out with no hope or faith in yourself at all.",GAD
401,"Yes.
I personally overcame a GAD (which started with several panic attacks at night); 3 doctors told me that, given the severity of symptoms, in my case it would be impossible to overcome this without antidepressants & sleeping pills first… and they were wrong. I was personally convinced that it was possible not to take these drugs but one told me “you know all patients think they can overcome this but it’s a lure, they’re not doctors they don’t know…”. I’ve literally spent 4 months through hell: recurring panic attacks, 3 hours of sleep nightly, debilitating pains the back that made it impossible to concentrate at work, I had the productivity of a 12-year-old child… But I studied the topic of anxiety and depression and I came to realize 2 things:
Our doctors with 10 years of studies aren’t so smart as they think about this issue, they just prescribe pills that they know “work” which means it hides the symptoms for most people (after trying 2, 3 for many of them) but don’t cure the root cause of anxiety. At best it will break a vicious circle, but your body is a very sensitive system and putting in something that will play with your neurotransmitters for 6-month will obviously alter something in your brain.
Mental disorders are more than we think an organic disease (such as liver cirrhosis for an alcoholic) than “psychological” diseases related to the way we think, childhood memories etc. (Doctors are behaving like all mental disorders are genetic or caused by a psychological trauma but it’s not always the case and in fact I would think that in the majority of cases people develop mental problems due to poor lifestyle which range from unhealthy diet to stressful jobs, toxic people, even heavy metals intoxication: I know this one is crazy but check Doctor’s Mark Hyman videos on YouTube you will see it’s true for thousands of people)
So now let’s do a quick summary of how I did it:
Never take benzos, I took them at first (Xanax) and it worsened the situation so badly, withdrawal was so hard. The only thing I took that was beneficial was Atarax (1st gen antihistaminic), it has a calming effect, helps sleep a little bit but nothing compared to a benzo, and it’s not addictive. BENZOS ARE DANGEROUS DRUGS, to me their effects were 5x more powerful than what I ever experienced with anything else, I couldn’t imagine something that was prescribed by a doctor could actually be a drug more dangerous than some illegal drugs… But it is.
Take time off (like 1-2 month) if your job is stressful in order to concentrate on healing your disease. But see people, friends, family, even animals, it’s key to healing.
HEAL YOUR BRAIN BY HEALING YOUR BODY FIRST. THE SAME THINGS THAT MAKE US SICK ALSO MAKE US ANXIOUS. Anxiety disorder is when anxiety is present everywhere without even being triggered by a negative thought. It’s clearly a brain dysfunction, you have to heal it. In my case it was not because I had bad thoughts that it triggered anxiety feeling in my body, anxiety feelings in my body did trigger bad thoughts. My body had become sick because of months of bad habits. For me that first horrible panic attack started after 4 months of hard partying every friday, saturday, + stressful job with late hours (1–2 in the morning), my body was completely exhausted and sick but I didn’t want to believe it.
Very short term: try soft medicine: acupuncture and hypnosis worked really well for me, but with reliable practitioners not some king of gurus
Short: STOP ALCOHOL, COFFEE AND REFINED SUGAR. You’ll probably be craving all of them for 2 weeks but after this you’ll REALLY feel better. Stop any other excitants if you’re taking them (ginseng etc.). Once you’ve recovered, limit your alcohol consumption to the bare minimum, it’s toxic for your brain.
Short (2 weeks to see the first effects), medium & long term: completely change the way you eat, eat organic food, lots of veggies, fruits, omega-3 fatty acids; add probiotics, vitamins, magnesium & zinc to your diet if necessary, food is the key to healing tons of chronic diseases for which we wrongly use antidepressants (IBS, fybromalgia, depression, anxiety… and even some autoimmune diseases)
Practice sport regularly (3, 4 times a week) but don’t get too hard on you in a time you’re really exhausted. It’s not the right moment to do an iron man.
And? It’s about everything. Another important one is to believe in god and do the good around you.
If you’re really to the point where you tried all this above and it doesn’t work, take ADs to break this vicious circle but still keep all those good habits above so you won’t relapse after stopping the medication. It’s not a shame to suffer from anxiety or depression, we all have to face our own issues, for some it’s obesity, others it’s diabete, for us it’s anxiety. Even if as you can read I don’t trust the pharmaceutical industry (their goal is to make money by selling the most medications as possible, the more side effects the more additional medications to sell) and I think doctors’ arrogance makes them blind about this plague, don’t waste the most beautiful years of your life fighting a disease. If after months and months of all what I told above you still have the problem (which I believe is unlikely though), go seek medication, it probably means your anxiety is related to something else. And as I told above, Atarax worked for me with almost no withdrawal symptoms (but its effect is mild)
Wishing you the best",GAD
402,"Symptoms. In generalized anxiety disorder, the person has persistent worry or anxiety that lasts for at least several months.

403,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions

Tbh I felt high/drugged on venlafaxine, but I was in such a dark place that I liked it, & over time it just felt like I naturally as a person didn't have anxiety anymore. I did get EVERY side effect on the list, intensely, but I was so mentally ill that o fought through it and after quite a while they went away.

410,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

415,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

But it didn't happen to us, it's none of our business.

417,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before.

419,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
420,"Ssri doesn't always do it.
The drug for anxiety is diazepam and much of the same group of benzodiazepines.
The problem with this group of sedating medicines is that they can be addictive and very difficult to come off.because of this many doctors will not prescribe them or at least prescribe for only a short period.
Last I heard is if you take maximum dosage for 2 months about 50% of people will begin signs of addiction.
Personally I was prescribed diazepam for 20 years,it was hugely beneficial ,I never felt any addictive symptoms at all and I have stopped taking for 1 year as my panic attacks have gone,so it seems just as some people are addictive types and will get hooked on anything, some,like myself, have always found it very difficult to get addicted to anything.
There are alternatives such as ssri,beta blockers such as propranolol, and other sedative type drugs which are not addictive but generally they are not as powerful for anxiety as diazapam.

421,"For me at least, having been diagnosed with MDD in around 1998, it was then that I realized I had been suffering from it for 20 years and didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was prescribed a drug called Zoloft and I was depression free for one whole year.
Anyway, I thought once the prescription was up, I was free with depression. It was the best entire year of my adulthood as I was about 35. I stopped taking the drug and nothing can compare to the depths of depression I experienced about 2 weeks later, and the following 20 almost.
So I experienced it for almost 20 years with out knowing it. I experienced 1 year free from it, and the next 20 years almost, knowing what was wrong and nothing helped.
Not knowing caused me, or let’s say set the stage for what became a life of solitude. It started with losing interest in everything. My circle of friends dwindled to nothing. My love life became such that a couple months would be the longest I could do before ending it. And what was worse was I could not explain why and the hurt I caused only magnified my depression until I stopped seeing women altogether. I swore I would never hurt anyone again. As it happened I met a woman that wouldn’t take no for an answer. My loneliness became my weakness and I married this woman, had a child and divorced 18 years later. I married for all the wrong reasons. And my wife held on and some how endured my bouts of depression.
I guess I only mentioned all this to give some perspective on not knowing what was wrong. To being able to actually have a long term relationship and a child to starting over with the experiences that gave me the insight and, I believe as good a person as any to answer the question.
MDD is a depression that comes back about every 3 months maybe, takes about two weeks before you hit rock bottom. You basically live under the covers for a couple weeks. Then 3 weeks or so to come back out.. My life was one big preparation for the next bout. No friends, a close family but completely separate lives. I lived alone, worked alone and as a tradesman who dealt with maybe 3 or 4 people and not often or for more than a few minutes. I could not commit to anything. A family trip, a favour, and never took vacations.
In short.
Although I somehow managed to hold on to a living, a marriage and even a child. With the exception of my daughter, MDD literally ruined my life. My work was during the dark times something I could do in my sleep. My marriage was a shamble from the beginning. I missed out on what could have been a pool of great friends, perhaps a job I enjoyed and maybe even the girl of my dreams, or at least a sex life maybe.
The overwhelming sadness is indescribable since there’s no explanation for it. The loneliness is a savour, since the opposite was too hard. And then throw in a series dose of anxiety and you go from profound sadness to debilitating fear. Too afraid to leave your bedroom, answering the phone was out of the question. A knock on the door, heart stopping.
Today 2023 at 60 years old and all but beat the depression and although mostly struggle with anxiety, I can say that every thing I’ve said is without exaggeration, and from different perspectives. How I managed to overcome what eventually became chronic depression is another story. There is a silver lining in every story and thank you for asking because I believe mine was worth telling.
In short, what’s it like to live with major depression disorder? It is nothing short of an overwhelming sadness with the added bonus of being in a nightmare called anxiety. And the aftermath of big gaps in the long term memory, It still can be very difficult to be in a group of people more than 3, and the curiosity of wondering what if.",GAD
422,"Well, I have both and it’s like having absolutely no interest in doing anything for days, weeks, maybe months. Then once you actually have that bit of energy to go out, make a phone call, invite a friend over, etc., you’re too anxious to. Keep in mind, I also have a little bit of agoraphobia.
Focusing on one at a time though:
Having MDD makes me constantly feel ashamed of myself. Everyone looks at me like I'm just being lazy and making excuses for myself. I feel disgusted with myself a lot too when I don’t do my laundry, shower or take the dirty dishes out of my room. The feeling of depression however is like a pit in your chest. It will feel like my heart is missing at times. Sometimes it’s a little harder to breath. Most of the time it’s not super bad, it just feels how you feel when you need to take a deep breath, but that never goes away. The world seems a little darker too. The sky is less blue, the clouds are more grey, everyone’s smiles get bigger though. Like the world is mocking you. I’ve taken a lot of medication for it and I’ve come to the realization that I may have TRD. Not everyone has that issue though and had I just had regular depression, I probably would be feeling a lot better by now.
GAD is worrying about everything that could go wrong. I can’t make phone calls, I just started being able to answer the phone, thinking of random scenarios that may or may not happen and have nothing to do with your current situation. For example, I think a lot about what if one of my cats just died right now. I would have no idea, because I don’t see them and I’m not checking on them and it would be my fault. I also think a lot about how everyone is lying to me. Like when I was younger, on Halloween, I never wanted to go to school dressed up because I was convinced everyone was playing a massive prank on me and I would be the only one dressed up. I didn’t want to tell anyone that though, because what if I told them and they thought I was stupid. It’s a lose lose kinda situation. It’s constant fear. The severity differs from person to person.
That is just my experience. Everyone is different :)",GAD
423,"Terrible. Horrible. Thanks to the medication I do have good days but some days I don’t even want to venture out of my room. It really is no fun and having the “stigma” of Mental Illness just makes it worse. Many people still do not realize how debilitating living with a mental illness can be. A lot of people still do not think that mental illness is real and believe that most sufferers are “faking it”. It shou;d be “mind over matter” and that you should just “snap out of it” and show no empathy and have zero sympathy! That is what living with serious mental illnesses is like! Believe me, I know what I’m talking about…especially having battled with depression, anxiety and P.T.S.D. for over 29 years. This is no exageration, there have been times when the mental pain coupled with the physical pain from my hernia when I have begged GOD to let me die! So yes, it is no picnic!",GAD
424,"To say it is like living in hell is a gross understatement. Unless you have taken action, I suggest calling 911 and that you should be in a hospital equipped with a psychiatric unit. Be very honest with them about how you feel. Be extremely vocal about suicidal ideation. They should be able to set you on a path that will culminate in you feeling almost normal again. Give it some time. Try not to feel guilty, especially for wrongdoing that you never did in the first place.

426,"Despite the challenges associated with managing anxiety, individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) can still find happiness and fulfillment in life. It's crucial to recognize that living with GAD involves approaching life's highs and lows with a unique perspective rather than implying a lack of joy.
Living with GAD entails navigating through increased worry and tension, yet it doesn't negate the diverse range of emotions and experiences available. Managing GAD often requires the development of coping strategies and resilience. Individuals with GAD can cultivate skills to navigate anxious moments through therapy, mindfulness, and other therapeutic techniques, fostering a more balanced mindset.
The journey with GAD provides opportunities for profound insights and personal growth. Overcoming anxiety challenges is akin to climbing a mountain – challenging during the ascent, but offering a breathtaking view upon reaching the summit. This process can lead to a deeper understanding of oneself, increased self-compassion, and a greater appreciation for inner beauty and resilience.
Social ties are essential because they provide as a safety net for people at difficult times in life. Friends, family, and professional support offer inspiration and compassion, building a foundation that enables people with GAD to appreciate life's moments more.
Living with GAD doesn't mean missing out on the joys of life. It involves navigating a unique path, discovering strengths in adversity, and embracing a spectrum of emotions. Similar to a rainbow appearing after a storm, moments of joy and fulfillment can shine through the clouds of anxiety. With the right support and strategies, individuals with GAD can lead rich and meaningful lives, finding beauty amidst the complexities that anxiety brings.",GAD
427,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
428,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD

430,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

431,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
432,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
434,"A 150% YES YES YES!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT SO IS. YOU NEED TO BEAT THE DISORDER not the ANXIETY. Talk to your therapist or if you don’t have one GO AND FIND ONE.
You need to find your deep factors which are the cause of this horrible thing. Even if you don’t think is, THERE IS! YOU HAVE TO FIND IT.
Think about why did your first panic attack or why did you felt so uncomfortable? That is your factor.
YOU CAN BEAT IT.
I PROMISE.
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.
ANXIETY DISORDER IS 100% CURABLE.",GAD
435,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long. Just annoyed and upset, and that’s perfectly fine!",GAD
436,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
437,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
438,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
439,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
440,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
441,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
442,"I have generalized anxiety disorder and it can only ruin your life if you let it ruin your life.
I have panic attacks and I have a life
I take antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds and have a life.
Your anxiety isn't your life, only you can let it destroy your life.",GAD
443,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
444,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
445,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
446,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
447,"Q: “I have generalized anxiety disorder; will the anxious thoughts just keep on coming one after the other all my life or will they come less often the more I correct them?”
A: I would like to start by saying I am not a doctor or therapist, nor have I had any medical training. My answer will be based on my own experience of struggling with GAD for nearly 20 years.
From your question, it seems as through you’ve gotten yourself help & a diagnosis; that’s a huge step & you should be proud. That being said, if you’re still struggling with GAD on your day-to-day life, I truly hope you are still receiving professional help, & talking to your doctor about this. If you’re not currently receiving treatment, you may want to reconsider. Even a therapy session once a month can be beneficial, & there is no shame in needing a little extra help.
Now, on to your question: I’ve personally experienced a dramatic decline in my intrusive anxious thoughts. This has happened over years of work, progress, therapy & medication. However, the extreme GAD symptoms I experienced in my early 20s (like panic attacks) do seem to have waned in my early 30s—-whether due to maturity itself, or more likely due to maturity plus the work I’ve put into therapy & the coping mechanisms I’ve learned along the way.
That may make it seem daunting, that it could take years, but it is a journey you’re likely to be on for your life. I’ve also had ups & downs in the severity of my GAD, depending on external life stressors. This is normal. It makes sense that you’d be more anxious during a big life change (like moving, new job, break up etc), & that’s ok! That’s the kind of thing that makes non-GAD sufferers feel anxious, so it’s only natural.
If you’re going through a lifestyle change of any kind, it can help to be preventative; for example, when I was dumped last year, one of the first things I did was to go back to talk therapy after a several years hiatus. I knew that it was affecting me emotionally, mentally & physically, & that I’d need extra help to get through.
I noticed in your question that you seem to be practicing a great coping mechanism, in which you face your anxious thought(s) & try to correct them. This is amazing! One of the most important things I learned in therapy is that the devil may be the king of lies, but he’s got nothing on anxiety! Meaning that anxiety often lies to you; it dramatizes & exaggerates. You’re always expecting the worst to happen, no matter how outlandish. So it is an important (if not vital) tool for you to acknowledge the illogical & improbability of an anxiety driven thought. It’s a technique I still use today, even after 17 years.
To sum up, it is definitely probable that your intrusive anxious thoughts will decrease over time. However, that’s if you’re receiving the proper help/treatment, putting in the work, and (if applicable) with the right medication. Don’t be daunted by potential setbacks, as they’re a normal part of the journey of living with GAD, & life has a way of throwing everyone curveballs. It seems as though you’re already heading in the right direction, so if you keep on this path & work with your doctor(s), you will likely begin to struggle less as time goes on.
I truly hope this helps, & answers your question! Thank you for reading!",GAD
448,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
449,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
450,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
451,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

452,"Anxiety disorder refers to a broad category of mental health disorders characterized by excessive and persistent feelings of fear, worry, and nervousness. It includes various specific disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, finances, and relationships. GAD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders and can also be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue.
Here are some key differences between anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder:
Scope of worry and anxiety: While anxiety disorder is a broad category that includes various specific disorders, GAD specifically refers to excessive worry and anxiety about multiple aspects of life.
2. Duration of symptoms: In order to be diagnosed with GAD, the individual must have experienced excessive worry and anxiety for at least six months.
3. Specific triggers: People with anxiety disorder may experience anxiety in response to specific triggers, such as social situations or specific objects or situations, while those with GAD may experience worry and anxiety without any specific trigger.
4. Physical symptoms: While both anxiety disorder and GAD can be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and restlessness, GAD is more likely to also include physical symptoms like fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
5. Impact on daily life: GAD can significantly impact an individual’s daily life, making it difficult to function and complete daily tasks, while anxiety disorder may have a more specific impact depending on the specific disorder.
6. Treatment: Both anxiety disorder and GAD can be treated with therapy and medication, but the specific treatment approach may differ depending on the individual’s symptoms and needs.

453,"Well a specific phobia is easily the most different of the three. It's a pervasive sense of fear, anxiety, or disgust causing someone to NEED to avoid such a thing. For instance, I have trypophobia (fear of many holes, tiny holes) and claustrophobia (fear of dark enclosed spaces.)
My trypophobia makes me have to look away, feel incredibly nauseous, and almost start crying just by seeing them. It feels as though my skin is crawling. It isn't always just holes, it can be circles such as this beach texture in Pokemon Legends Arceus that makes me feel icky or the way wasps nests look. I love Steven Universe, but seeing the kindergartens (which are where gems break out through the earth in a mass production thing so lots of holes) made me want to cry and I could NOT look at the screen. My claustrophobia is a bit different as it's mostly enclosed or tiny spaces. I feel trapped and terrified and may have a panic attack. I get that way in cars as well. The dark does make it worse (I also have a fear of the dark), but just the thought makes me feel like I could die. It's intense fear/anxiety/disgust at these specific things. It can be so genuinely upsetting for people. For instance, I think it was some trashy show, but they brought in a woman who was afraid of olives and promised her they wouldn't show her then then they brought out olives anyway. The reason she feared them was because it reminded her of the eyes of a corpse of a family member. It was a traumatic experience and a trigger for her. Phobias can be brought about by traumatic experiences which can be small or minor things as well. I can't say for sure where my phobias come from, but they can't be helped either way. So phobias typically have a specific trigger.
While GAD and SAD can have triggers, they are typically scenarios, different, etc. Phobias always have the same trigger with it being something that resembles the phobia (for instance, it may not be the exact same object or thing, but it's similar enough that the brain thinks of it like that.) While GAD and SAD have far more broad triggers. For instance, my GAD is triggered by a lot of scenarios involving people as well as my trauma. It plays into how I react and worsens my PDs. But it isn't strictly social scenarios, it can be anything where it feels as though something will go wrong.
SAD is socially based entirely. Thoughts of social interactions, being out in public, feeling constantly scrutinized, wondering if people are watching or looking at you, wondering if you sound normal just to name a few. My GAD affects me socially, but it is GENERALIZED anxiety in which case it is far more broad. GAD for others can include something bad happening to people, feeling like it's the end of the world over small things, fearing an actual end of the world, anxiety constantly where it's just like everything feels like it'll go wrong and pervasive thoughts of “what if this happens or that happens?” SAD is pervasive anxiety in social situations, whether it's online, over text, in person, just being in public, on call, etc. Both disorders are pervasive and regular experienced, aka chronic even when they aren't actively in a scenario. While phobias are often not constant and only when a person is around the specific thing they fear or something that resembles it. For instance, someone fearing wide open spaces may encounter it more so they'll be more triggered than something like a phobia of cats where they can often be avoided. Or olives can typically be avoided and while thunderstorms may not always be avoidable since weather is unpredictable so if you're in a place with such weather patterns, you can't exactly avoid it.",GAD
454,"GAD is characterized by chronic, excessive worry. Causes may include genetics, brain chemistry, and life events. Treatments include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, and lifestyle changes. GAD differs from other anxiety disorders in its pervasive and generalized nature. Explore my Quora Profile for more on causes and treatments for GAD.",GAD
455,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
456,"Other answers have nailed this. A simple way I distinguish Anxiety disorders is that they all represent a fear of something: health, phobia, panic PTSD; memory of trauma, social anxiety and OCD: fear that you hold responsibility for something specifically bad happening and you need to remove the thought by doing a routine/ritual. But with GAD the fear is uncertainty and this fuels worry. Any situation that generates future ‘what it’ thoughts turns on worry, that turns on anxiety, that turns on more negative predictions and generates more uncertainty.",GAD
457,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
458,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

459,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
460,"Anxiety disorder is a broad term that includes various types of anxiety, such as panic disorder, social anxiety, or phobias.

461,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
462,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
463,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
464,"My first job was as a part-time cashier at a supermarket.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but I have sensory issues. Of all the emotional pain I’ve dealt with in my life, nothing compares to sensory overload. You know the trash compactor scene in Star Wars? It’s like that. Like the walls are closing in on all sides, mountains of things building up and slowly crushing you to death. There is no way to escape and no one to hear you scream, nothing to do but wait for the inevitable moment when the pain reaches unbearable levels and the last breath is squeezed from your lungs.
I was barely functioning. I couldn’t count out change, I couldn’t follow instructions with more than one step, I couldn’t understand what people were saying when they were talking to me. I couldn’t think.
But I was supposed to learn quickly, follow instructions immediately, remember a plethora of unwritten rules, make small talk with customers, answer questions, comply with customer requests, memorize produce codes, count out change.
And smile as I did it.
For up to six hours.
(Also, side note, if your cashier doesn’t smile and say hello when you enter the line, that doesn’t mean she is “rude and disrespectful” or “not trying” or “ungrateful for her job” or “exactly what’s wrong with this generation”. Maybe she’s suffering from severe anxiety and she literally cannot speak. Please, please, have compassion.)
The only way I could do anything was complete mental shutdown. I was told at least once per shift that I looked depressed, I had difficulty putting things into bags because I was so dissociated I couldn’t tell where my hands were, but I could breathe. I could barely understand English, but I could breathe.
I thought that was normal.
I tried to tell my parents about it, but I assumed they knew the emotions I felt. To them, it was just complaining. So I was treated to talks from parents and grandparents about all the worst jobs they’d ever had and how they were so much worse than mine and life is work, and what I learned was that life is a contest to see who can bear the most pain without letting anyone see, and if I spent a single moment not in agony that meant I was lazy.
I learned not to confide in anyone. I learned to suppress my anxiety attacks until I was alone. I did not learn how to calm down from them.
The anxiety attacks began to happen outside of work more and more often. I was constantly on the verge of one. The twenty-four hours surrounding each shift were complete panic.
To cope, I completely blocked my job out of my mind. I shut off any and all thoughts related to it, I told myself that the hours I worked didn’t exist. I was left with only a vague feeling of dread.
After over a year, I quit my job.
But the dread persisted. It wasn’t connected to my job anymore—I had so completely removed my job from my mind that I no longer remembered it as the source of my anxiety. Life was the reason I was anxious. Life was hard, life was pain, if it was bearable I was doing it wrong.
My problems were invalid because my life was too good. I didn’t have problems, I was just lazy and weak.
I suspect these are not the “life lessons” my parents had wanted me to learn when they drove me to the supermarket to fill out an application.
Though that was a while ago, I still have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I’m still constantly anxious, worried that I’m doing something wrong or something bad is going to happen. The dread is a self-fulfilling prophecy: something bad happens eventually, and then it’s proven right. My triggers have changed, but the anxiety is still there.
I’m working on it. I understand now where the dread came from, and I understand that the negative messages I received from the adults in my life were due to miscommunication on my part.
I feel a bit embarrassed that my anxiety disorder was caused by such a minor thing as a part-time job… but I know that’s my anxiety talking, and my mental health issues are still valid. It has taken me a long time to accept that.",GAD
465,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
466,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD

Dealing with real life ‘here and now’ ‘tangible’ situations instead is far more important, and once you’ve dealt with them. Give them no more thought!",GAD
472,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
473,"Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders & Panic Attacks
Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as emotional distress, pacing back and forth, shortness of breath, pain & fatigue.
It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death.
Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat.
Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing.
It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fast heart rate, rapid breathing or slow breathing, fatigue and problems in concentration.
Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.
People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.
""Anxiety Disorder""
Is a group of mental disorders characterise by significant anxiety and fear. It is different from common Anxiety.
For people who Anxiety Disorder, the worry and fear are constant and overwhelming. It can disable a person to do any thing.
But with treatment many people can manage those feelings and they can work normally.
""Panic Attacks""
Are sudden periods of Intense Fear that may include sweating, palpitations, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness & feeling that something bad is going to happen.
The fear and anxiety during panic attack is so severe that patient is unable to do anything.
The maximum degree of symptoms occurs with in minutes. Typically they will last for 30 minutes, but duration can vary from few seconds to hours.
Panic Attacks themselves are not dangerous. The treatment of Panic Attack is directed toward underlining cause.
Counselling & Breathing training and muscle relaxation techniques are quite help full in these patients.
In serious patients medical treatment is required by clinical Psychiatrist.
Anxiety is due to mind & body reaction to something which can cause fear or apprehension like exams, job interview and disturbances in love affair or relationship, if someone is seriously threatening you or in life threatening situations etc.
Anxiety can also be due to unknown reasons or due to imaginary things which are not real.
This will happen to people who have ‘Anxious Personality’.
Some people will become quite anxious even with trivial problems.
Some people will remain calm and confident even when they are facing big problems in their life. It depends upon Individual Personality.
Anxiety can be due to environment, circumstances, genetics, certain type of health problems, Caffeine ( drinking too much Coffee ), Alcohol, Drugs etc.
Physiologically Anxiety is caused by low levels of a Neurotransmitter called ‘GABA’. It reduces the activity in Central Nervous System ( Brain ).
Anxiety is common in Teenage Youngsters and in Young Adults.
Anxiety is a ‘Protective Mechanism’ given to you by the God. It prepares your mind and body for upcoming situation, threats or challenges in your life.
Anxiety is a normal human mind and body reaction to a difficult or odd situation.
Some people with ‘Anxious Personality’ have more anxiety compare to normal people.
Excessive Anxiety can cause ‘Panic Attacks’ or ‘Nightmares’.
Normally Anxiety will disappear after the difficult situation is over. But in few people it will persist for long time.
For mild to moderate grade of Anxiety Sports, Jogging, Meditation & Yoga exercises will be quite help.
You should concentrate your mind on pleasant thoughts & God when you are doing Meditation.
Reading Books on Positive Thinking & Positive Attitude will also help you.
If your Anxiety is persistent and bothering you too much, then it is advise to consult a qualified Psycho-therapist or a Clinical Psychiatrist.

474,"Two words have gotten me through a great deal of trouble with anxiety:
BUBBLE BATHS.
Doing something strictly for relaxation, like a bath or meditation or yoga, can help a lot. The first few times it's tough - your mind wants to keep running at 150 mph - but your body slowly begins to force the issue and your muscles relax, your breathing slows, and eventually these relaxation havens become a blissful break from worry.",GAD
475,"So let’s talk about anxiety—because managing anxiety is one of the most prevalent features of being a person in a society that is distinctly unfriendly to autistic people.
Anxiety is the sine qua non of autism. We walk around constantly over-tasked by our environments and the people in them, in addition to dealing with a stable of assumptions about what we should be, with the force of moral normalizing behind it. We walk around knowing, or at least often unpleasantly reminded, that we’re different, in a society in which that difference is bad, or wrong, being forced by that difference to constantly compensate for the ways we differ from others but only in the “right” ways: even our compensation patterns have to be regulated.
It’s no wonder we’re exhausted. It’s no wonder we’re anxious. It’s no wonder we burn out easily.
I do several things to help myself manage that anxiety:
Arrange a very low stimulation home environment. I may not be able to manage my workplace to reduce my stress, but I absolutely can come home to a quiet, dim, comfortable place for the sake of my own sanity. I highly recommend this as a coping mechanism: no one can be ‘on’ all the time, in the way the society around us demands that we be ‘on.’ If you cannot add things to your workplace to manage your stress, I urge you to manage it at home.
Recognize that there are domains you cannot control. The worst of my anxiety comes from being stuck between trying to manage my anxiety but being without the ability to change (either because I lack that authority or because I just don’t have enough energy to do it) enough of my environment to help manage that anxiety, coupled with the sneaking suspicion that I’m being expected to manage that environment and myself all the time. It’s a particularly helpless situation, and nothing ramps up my anxiety worse than feeling helpless. If I formally (for myself) recognize the boundaries of my ability to control the situation and myself, I recognize that there’s things I simply cannot control, and it helps me reduce my expectations that I should be controlling the situation. We’re asked to control an awful lot of things: ourselves, our environment, our responses, outcomes of our actions, etc. The world around us seems to demand that we control everything because it expects us to be as others are without the least bit of help or preparation. Trying to honor that request will panic you, burn you out, and make you paranoid. Recognizing what you can and can’t do (and reminding yourself of it) can help force parameters on what feels like chaos.
Recognize that there is definitely a limit to what you can do, and it’s not where other people’s limits exist. One of the worst things I’ve ever done to myself is to expect that, because of my IQ, I could manage my limits, everyone else’s expectations, and the environment. I can manage a lot, thanks to that IQ, but I am not omnipotent. I do get tired. I do get burned out, with a creeping fog that I don’t recognize until I can barely perform basic addition. I have limits. I know more or less where they are, and they definitely aren’t where everyone else’s limits are, but there’s nothing I can do about that. I can only do what I can do.
Recognize the moralizing component to normality and reject it. It’s very, very hard not to feel defective when you look around you and are so relentlessly reminded that you aren’t as others are, and that no matter how you feel about it, others view it as a defect (and often as a moral defect.) As a result, you’re constantly receiving feedback that you’re defective. It takes a particularly thick skin to deal with that on a daily basis, and a particularly persistent mind to keep trying to contribute despite knowing that everything you do is going to be graded on a negative curve because of shit you can’t help. That moralizing component is sneaky, too—even when you know it’s there, you can still find yourself judging yourself for being something you know you can’t be. We’re very permeable as people to the society around us, even when we don’t mean to be and know better.
Forgive yourself. I suspect many of us with high functioning autism are, for lack of a better word, closet optimists. We almost have to be, to go out in the world and keep trying to get along with others. It takes a very specific kind of emotional and mental discipline to keep trying, even when people have made it very clear to you that interacting with others is a losing game. Many of us hold it against ourselves that we keep losing. We get angry with ourselves for being so… persistently different, and the fact that we are often blamed for the reactions of others does not help. Forgive yourself when you catch yourself being angry for that which you cannot change.
Acknowledge your differences. One of the nastier traps I ever got caught in was a loop: I had an okay interaction with others, therefore I’m normal. But I’m not normal, I had a bad interaction. But different is bad. I can’t be different, I’m not bad. I had a good interaction, I must be normal. That loop right there is very destructive via preoccupation, and easy to fall into while you struggle to meet the “normal” expectations of others in society, including that moralizing component. I find that acknowledging to myself, openly, that I am different and the ways that I am different helps me combat the drive to be “normal” in my interactions with others and the normative assumptions I can suffer from when I spend time with people who are not autistic. If I acknowledge those differences to myself, it’s a lot easier to take compensatory action, too—the emotional roller coaster of frustration, guilt, shame, and anger is greatly circumvented by the explicit acknowledgement, even if only to myself, of those differences.
This, too, shall pass. The worst part of meltdowns and problems with functioning, in my perception, is the shame. Even if I manage to hide it (and I almost always do), it is and can be profoundly shaming to me that I wouldn’t be able to do as others do. A lot of this list is about managing the emotional side of the over-tasking we experience in society, and it’s for a reason: we do have emotions. We are, after all, fully human no matter what people say about us, and all this managing of ourselves often leaves us especially vulnerable to emotions. We pretend we don’t have them, we learn to suppress them, but they’re there. Managing our emotions is an enormous drain on our energy, because it is our emotions that so often mark us as different and inspire others to dislike us: laughing when we shouldn’t, being stressed when others aren’t, being upset when everyone else is fine. Humans are amazingly oriented toward groups, and our condition constantly ostracizes us (rather, others ostracize us for it, blaming us.) We feel shame when ostracized, which tends to worsen any symptoms we’re experiencing and greatly increase our mental over-tasking. I’ve learned to be downright philosophical about the whole thing over time: I can’t be as others are, and whatever’s happening right now won’t last forever. It helps me move past my emotions faster and back into a state of greater equilibrium. This, too, shall pass.
Take alone time. I know, I know. We’re too often alone to start with. Most of us have been rather firmly told our place with regard to society, and live in fear of people “discovering” our differences and holding it against us. Being alone can be a source of shame, because after all, the rest of the damn world can manage to be around each other without it being this big of a problem. And yet, it is the “recharge time,” the down time, that helps us to be social in the first place. It’s not that we don’t like people (most of us would really like to like people), it’s that being around people is difficult in ways that it is both hard to explain and hard to compensate for. There’s an unspoken, constant gap that we’re hard pressed to bridge and others have no idea how to bridge (and don’t notice.) Alone time can be a gift. It can give you the energy to apply to bridging that gap. Viewing time alone as a shame simply robs us of the gift of time to recharge. Learning to appreciate that time and use it to be renewed does a lot to help you manage everything else.
Seek ways to view your wholeness, not just your deficiencies. This is more in the nature of self-care, but thanks to the social factors above, it’s easy to walk around with a self-concept that essentially takes for granted that you, as an autistic person, are essentially a defective human being. It’s easy to believe that you aren’t good enough, rather than that you’re different. Part of the reason so many of us strike others as prideful is that we’re clinging to the skills we do have, in the face of a million reasons why we should feel defective. I cannot in good conscience give you the advice to be proud, because that will absolutely get in your way just as efficiently as feeling worthless. Rather, I would say, that you should spend time in contemplation of the ways in which you are whole. Not necessarily contemplating your pride in it (especially not in the form of “well at least I have ______”), but simply viewing the ways in which you are a complete human being. I assure you, you are a complete human being. Our differences do not make us anything less than a complete human being, and the way the society around us handles that particular issue is downright poisonous to the people who are more normal, let alone us.
Plan, but recognize that you can’t plan for everything. There’s a reason so many of us are oriented toward structure: the world is full of some seriously disturbing randomness. People are disturbingly random. Shit happens, and you will drive yourself crazy if you carry about the belief that you can compensate for anything and everything that happens, in addition to the beliefs that anything outside your plans is bad, that you’re obligated to have a plan for everything, and that your plans must always be as reality functions. Honestly, I do plan copiously, as a way to manage stress. But I find that in reality, having a tool set is more important than a specific plan, and that in the end, the idea that I can always know what to do next is… cruel and unrealistic. Don’t get mad at people for not conforming to your plans, and that includes you. We simply cannot see all the factors.
Be patient and recognize that you cannot expect of yourself what others expect of you, mostly because they have no idea how much their expectations will cost.
If you can find someone to listen to you, it will help enormously. I suggest trying out therapists until you find someone who is capable of listening—and most therapists aren’t, so this might take you some time.
In the mean time, however, think hard about what you expect from yourself.",GAD
476,"People with anxiety feel okay, fine most of the time. I had not beign diagnosed with anxiety. I'm sure I have it. I do not considerate I have a generalized anxiety. As is something that come unexpected and last a few minutes up to 20 minutes. And is not happening every day. If not a twice per month.
Started right after my husband passed away. Come unexpectedly. How do I know I have it? I recognize it. Start out of nowhere. If I'm in a place where I had to wait for a while longer in line. If I'm looking at something specific ( will not tell) usually I started to move one of my legs non stop for a minute. I can control the leg movement. When I start to move it and when to stop it. Is my way to cope with that sudden anxious feeling. Like when you rock slowly back and forth a child to console. I think moving the leg is the same for a anxious person. Is a copying mechanism.
I had witnessed people do this leg movement in public and in restaurants . A family was having dinner. The male in the family shacked his legs non stop. Looks out of place to be doing that.
Well, is a sign the person do not like to wait, is in a hurry for something or is anxious. I have days when I feel great. I had days when all seems fine, and later on in the same day . I started to felt anxious out of nowhere. Without nothing triggers that.
I have an enormous amount of energy. If I don't release it. Can be overwhelming. So, is important to letting out the excess of energy. Exercises is the answer to me.
I would recommend to take a warm/hot bath. Do exercises like walking, dancing, cycling. I had never tried Yoga. I think could be a good idea for someone else to do. Drink a relaxing or antistress tea.",GAD
477,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
478,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
479,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
480,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions
If you or anyone you know have any doubts about having mental health issues, I advice you to get it checked by a psychiatrist. It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders
I hope this helped :)",GAD
481,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD

483,"The best way to ignore the racing thoughts and chills is to perform positive self-talk. For example, if you have anxiety of driving bridges, drive the bridge and tell yourself everything is fine repeatedly. Eventually your anxiety will lessen.",GAD
484,"I don't want to belittle what you are going through at all. I have GAD and I get it, believe me. But having GAD does not mean that you have lost the ability to calm down. You are not broken. Your brain is not broken. You have the exact same ability to calm yourself down as anybody else does. You are just mentally exhausted and don't think you do. That's the problem.
I know you didn't ask for advice on that so that is all I will say about that and chuck that in the trash if you want.... :)
But as far as your original question goes, you will never get anybody who doesn't have anxiety, to understand what it is like to have anxiety.
There is nothing you can say. Nothing you can do. They just don't get it. My advice, as somebody who has lived with this for 20 years, is to just not give a damn what anybody thinks, and to not feel like you owe anybody a reason or an explanation for anything.
GAD is a very personal thing and it is a lonely path to walk. There should be a good support group in every town where everybody with GAD can come and vent their frustrations because that is the only place you are going to find people who understand and can empathize. Outside of a counselor's office, that is.
Just keep your head up and do your thing and don't worry about other people's perceptions or trying to make them understand. GAD is a sign of a tired, stressed out, over-thinking mind, and the last thing you need to be doing is wasting mental energy worrying about what others think.

486,"Get your inflammation markers down.
don’t overlook homocysteine, it’s in the case of anxiety the most important marker.
It is especially difficult for females as it takes a heck of a lot of emotional effort not to become bitchy. This is true without autism and men (grumpy old men) too.
Parallel to that for boys’n’girls Iodine deficiency plays a massive role. The Japanese consume 10 x more iodine than anybody else on the planet, mostly in form of PotassiumIondine which one can ingest in quantity. All that for good reason.
Autist have a genetic predisposition to a slowed Folate-Methylation-Cycle (FoMP), which is nice, it lowers cancer probability.
To support the FoMP use:
MethylFolate = Methylated B9, B3,B6,B12 ( B 3, 6, 9,12 - easy to remember but using a B-complex is easier but deceptive because most manufacturers use Folic Acid but not Folinic Acid because of cost. But for a autist Folic Acid is poison!
Magnesium
Potassium
Zinc (oysters)
Biotin (Quinoa)
Reduce Aspirin / Salicylic Acid intake (zero is not possible)
So far the support which is in many cases the opportunity for nature to heal itself.
Big advantage is it is all food, non toxic.
As Aspirin and many foods are high in Salicylic Acid we see that toxic medication and food can be the same. Low toxicity is important around autism.
All up the liver has ~8 detox pathways where a few depend on a FoMP ticking along always nicely which isn’t the case for Autists. This can often be compensated by just diet but just as often not in the beginning.
To address underlying causes one has to have a look at microbes in biofilms that do not show on tests because of too low presence.
These are the causes to many food intolerances and it leads to allergies.
To fix all the problems caused by microbes a FoMP running like a Mercedes is needed. A GM or Ford = just Hamburgers and Pizza won’t do.
To fix a car one needs spare parts, oils, brake fluid, asf . . . and as the FoMP makes protein it manufactures spare parts for the body to make cells, provide the liver with detox wrappers, asf . . .
Top quality proteins are needed for a good myelin sheath. If that is crumbly the nervous system can’t work properly.
How to check? Easy If the hair is full and heavy this is working fine. NatURe is amazing and the underlying causes are the same!
The supplements mentioned so far help systemically and the minerals help the Kidneys in particular. pH balance is nearly all done by breathing but there are necessary chemical steps that cannot be done that way and here the kidneys take care of pH balancing via electrolytes. This is critically important for the FoMP to run fine.
Reflux, gastritis, stomach ache, heartburn, stomach ulcer = pH balancing doesn’t work well enough and that will lead to insulin resistance, diabetes, pancreatitis.
Tackle that.

487,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
488,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
489,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
490,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

491,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
492,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
493,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
494,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
495,"Thanks for the A2A.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD
496,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.

497,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

A.a",GAD
498,"Anxiety disorder is when one becomes pre-occupied with “What if . . .” mode. We get caught up in a long list of fears. We lose our clarity of thought because the emotion of fear takes over and so we fail to realise that “What if . . .” is pure speculation about the future. We allow ourselves to get stressed about something that hasn’t even happened! Anxiety, worry, fear of failure, fear of illness, fear of poverty and fear of old age and death. Another example is fear of success: if we have completed a task successfully there is often the idea that we may be asked to do something more and then the fear comes that we may not be successful. Our lives can become very unhappy about things that may never happen. Such focus is always on external things, that is on circumstances or relationships in life that we cannot control anyway.
Other than medication we can fight this with meditation. Meditation enables you to re-discover the self. This opens a channel to have a heart to heart conversation with Almighty. It allows you to penetrate progressively into the deeper levels of the mind. You peep into the hidden world of reality. It’s a technique of self-exploration. It leads to the experience of heightened and expanded awareness and reaching God. The main aim of meditation is to connect with and experience the love of The Almighty. You experience God’s unconditional love and realise that you are a creator of your environment.
There are teachers at Brahma Kumaris centres who teach Rajyoga meditation. In this meditation you establish a loveful link between the soul and the Supreme Soul. The link takes the soul in a state of absorption of power, peace, purity, bliss and a sense of fulfilment.
Raja Yoga meditation redefines the self as a soul and enables a direct connection and relationship with the Supreme Source of purest energy and highest consciousness. Raja Yoga can be translated as ‘supreme union’, or as ‘highest connection’. Every soul has a right to experience this ultimate relationship.

There’s even a free class that teaches how to meditate. The problem with anxiety is that when I feel panicked my breathing becomes rapid, causing more anxiety. Meditation helps me slow down and focus on taking deep breaths, in through the nose, hold for a few seconds and release it. Doing this over and over for the length of time I choose my meditation teaches me how to acknowledge my thoughts then let them go, each time bringing them back to the breath. It’s been very effective and I can now manage the extreme emotional feelings in my life on a daily basis.

504,"Counseling and therapy. I think this is the best way to really learn to manage GAD
Avoid caffeine! Avoid stimulants and high sugar foods.
Exercise.
Journal about why your anxious when your anxiety is bad. -This will allow you to release and work through some of the anxiety as well as keep a catalog of times and things that make you anxious which can be helpful when trying to find coping mechanisms or trying to identify your triggers.
Learn breathing techniques that work for you.
Find a support group.
Eat a healthy diet.
Maybe try some natural supplements like fish oil.
Don't be to hard on yourself, understand that you have GAD and it's not easy and it will be okay.
Practice positive talk. If you're anxiety makes you think ""I'm going to fail” or “""what if this happens” Always try to counter that with a positive thought like, “""what if I do good” or “""what if I have a lot of fun”
You can try scents. Like calming aromas lavender. Or stronger scents like peppermint to help jolt your brain out of an anxiety loop. Biting into a lemon or jalapeno can also help get your brain back on track.
Do some research on what GAD is and what is happening in your body. Understanding it will help you feel more in control and just give you some ease about what you're going through.
A good therapist will help you understand what your body is doing when you have GAD. They will help you identify things that trigger your anxiety and help you find ways to cope with anxiety. It takes time and work, but if you really try, you can really manage your anxiety better. It's not an overnight thing, but the sooner you start, the sooner you start improving and then the sooner you'll have days where you'll realize you didn't have anxiety when you normally would or that your anxiety wasn't as bad as usual and those are great feelings. And the sooner you start, the sooner you can look back and say wow I've come a long way since my first appointmmet “x” amount of time ago.",GAD
505,"Simple answer is you don’t. You reach out for help, whether that's medication or therapy or a combo of both, you educate yourself on the effects of GAD so you know what you’re dealing with and you make time, daily, for self care. Meditation and yoga have both been proven to be beneficial for mental health and brain development (through neuroplasticity, which is rewiring your brain,) they boost confidence and self esteem levels, both of which help to combat against anxiety and depression; ,less caffeine, less processed foods and more whole foods and lots of self compassion",GAD
506,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
507,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, exaggerated anxiet and worry about everyday life events with no obvious reasons for worry.
People who have a generalized anxiety disorder or GAD uncontrollably worry about common situations. It is also sometimes known as chronic anxiety disorder.
GAD is different from normal feelings of anxiety. It is common to feel anxious about the things that happen in your life, like they can't stop worrying about health, money, family, work, or school. This can happen even when there is no reason to worry.
Sometimes people with this condition simply worry, but cannot say what worries them. They report feelings that something bad can happen or they can report that they simply cannot calm down.

510,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder is a form of anxiety that extends to a variety of situations in life. It can be debilitating, and keep one from living a normal and happy life.
That said there are multiple different ways to fight all types of anxiety, and one of the best is meditation.
You can either focus on your breath, on the sounds around you, on simply letting thoughts pass through your mind, or any other form. As long as you’re concentrating on one specific thing for an extended period of time, than you are meditating.
If you’re new to it, start with five minutes. In time you’ll be able to increase the number of minutes you spend meditating.
Just keep in mind that the point of meditation isn’t to shut off your thoughts, but rather to focus your mind. The result of a good meditation will lead to a quiet mind, but it’s not the point of meditation.
In addition your mind will wander, and that’s perfectly normal. Do not get frustrated and angry at yourself. Simply revert your attention back to your breath, or whatever it is that you’re focusing on.
Now this is just ONE way to handle anxiety and stress, and it’s a preemptive strategy. I, myself, used to deal with excruciating anxiety, and through the years came up with my own method that ultimately allowed me to overcome it for good.

513,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
514,"Yes, some do.
I was diagnosed with GAD as a 5-year-old.
However, I don’t think it was an impairment or that I really suffered from it until around age 12 or so.
I did have anxiety before then, but it was very trivial, and it didn’t impair me. I was still a normal child, and it mostly manifested itself socially, though I do remember some instances that I would attribute to milder GAD.
Age 12–13 was when it became chronic and problematic, but compared to my present mental outlook, it was great.
Age 14 was when things started to get rough, and I was put on loads of pills and sent back to therapy.
Age 15–16 my emotional fluctuation was gone. There was no more, “mostly unhappy, some good days.” It was all a sea of misery, blandness, anxiety, and mental numbess I started to lose my connection to my environment. It felt like my life was a dream. And my anxiety lost it’s specificity, and branched out into EVERYTHING, including irrational ideas and I felt like there was some outside force that could undermine everything I do. I got off of the pills when I was about 16 and 1/2. They were ineffective. Therapy was also ineffective, and I was told I was a tough case by the therapist, due to the fact my anxiety was so broad and unspecific.
I’m 17 now, and most of what I said here still applies. I’m a walking zombie weighed down by a general anxiousness and misery about the world around me, which I barely feel in-tune with. I have lost my ability to be emotionally “moved” by anything. I have zero joy. I don’t even cry, I’ve lost that emotional range.
I think it’s safe to say young people experience GAD, unless what I’m describing is completely normal or something else.",GAD
515,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.
To completely answer your question: it’s very likely the child will grow up and realise people don’t worry and fret about things as much as they do. This will make them realise they’re different and their GAD contrasts them from how other people think.",GAD
516,"That is a very good question. I suffer from anxiety/bipolar. Yes, I have been anxious my entire life and it did seem normal. It has always had a tremendous impact on my life. When the impact is inescapable, that is what will push someone to get help.
When I reached a point that I was crying all of the time, non-stop, and it effected my ability to get along with co-workers, and I had panic attacks every night and throughout the day, then getting help was unavoidable. The unfortunate part is that the treatment I received was only for depression, and the meds actually made the anxiety worse. Eventually, I was treated also for anxiety, and the meds actually made the anxiety/mania worse. Finally, I was diagnosed with bipolar and the meds were appropriately balanced out. It took a long time to arrive, but I am glad that I finally got the help that I needed!",GAD
517,"Question; Do young people suffer from generalized anxiety disorder?
Depending on your definition of “young”, that could be yes, or no.
Personally speaking, I have been identified as having some form of generalisd anxiety disorder, that specifically arises from a fear of dying (not death as a whole, just my own personal death) and results in my increased levels of anxiety around anything that could be a potential threat (which is to say everything, since at any moment I could develop a cancer, have a heart attack etc).
Originally I was identified as having this disorder when I was around eighteen, which may or may not be classified as a “young person” depending on defintion. Now I am twenty years of age, so I would not in a classical sense be classified as being a “young person”; however, when investigating my disorder, myself and the professional backtraked most of the cases for when I had been displaying classical behaviour of anxiety, and found that I had likely had several anxiety attacks without specifically realising that was what they were, which had been occuring a lot earlier than when I was identified as having GAD. From this it could be suggested that I, in fact, had been suffering from this for a lot longer than originally suspected, and the only reason that I didn’t realise was that there was some difficulty for me when I experienced these.
Speifically speaking, the difficulty I had was identifying that I was experiencing anxiety.
Now, I can come up with two reasons why I was having this difficulty. The first is that, as I was reasonably young, it was possible that I didn’t have enough experience or knowledge to articulate my feelings; I didn’t know enough to know that anxiety was what I was feeling. This partly comes from the fact that I was young and therefore generally did not know enough or have enough experience yet.
The second reason was a more personal one. I always struggle, even now, to identify my own emotions. For me, emotions and thoughts are effectively the same thing, so I struggle to identify what I am feeling in the moment, and instead can usually only do it in reflection of the event.
Putting asside the second reason, as that may or may not be a uniques of my own self, the initial reasoning may suggest something about psycology in young people; namely that they may indeed suffer from such things as anxiety and perhaps depression, from quite a young age, but they may not have the knowledge or experience to realise that is what they are feeling. After all, if you can’t name the feeling, how can you describe it? Would anxiety just be a “bad case of fear”? Or would depression just be a “really really bad case of sadness” (or lonliness, or laziness etc)?
Now, if that is the case, how would you remedy the issue, and learn what it is young people are feeling? There are a few options. Firstly, you can teach them the necessary language to articulate their feeling (ie. explaining what anxiety and depression are) . With this they may be able to identify it in themselves, although I still think this is unlikely since they will not have the necessary experience to understand what it really means to feel an emotion like that until they really do have it. Another option would be actually speaking to young people. If you are an adult, and ask someone younger what their feeling, you can use your own experience to perhaps identify what the issue is, rather than after they end up doing somethingm, young people’s mental disorders may be identified early, and dealt with before they become a major issue.
So, in answer to your question, based off of my own experience and viewpoint I believe young people can suffer from GAD, as well as a plethora of other problems.",GAD
518,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
519,"Yes. I’m an example. Grew up in an environment of physical violence and emotional abuse.

520,"Very hard to know if generalized anxiety disorder can be learned. I have my doubts. But this is what helicopter parenting does.
A child who has overprotective parents will not learn to trust themselves. They may struggle in life learning how to be independent when perhaps it is better learned in early teenage years. They learn distorted fears from their parents. Catastrophic thinking in the parents is adopted by the kid through just trying to be like their parents. All kids try to be like their parents except where there is pain in doing so. Then they want to be the opposite of the parents. Parents in general expect their kids to “be” like them. This is so dumb. An offspring of two parents will be a unique individual. Their inability to “be” what their parents instruct? Results in feelings of inadequacy. And loss of self worth. Leave them alone. Let them do things for themselves instead of solving all their needs for them by guesswork. They know everything the need to know almost by 12 these days. All the lecturing you put into “teaching”? It is natural for them to ignore you when they start puberty. You are wasting your breath. Let your kid be unique in the way they want to be. Not the way you want them to be. Accept as is. As long as you have taught morals and good choices vs bad? They can figure alot our on their own. Give them some trust so they feel capable of doing it on their own. Mommy and daddy may still be around at 18, but their work is done quite earlier than they realize.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.

Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
522,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD

524,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

526,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

527,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
528,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
529,"Yes. Here’s how it works. Anxiety generally leads to avoidance. So if you’re scared of failing at your job, you’ll avoid your job. Avoidance leads to self guilt. So now you’re upset at yourself for failing to do your job. Self-guilt reinforces the anxiety. Because now the the thing you’re afraid of is scarier than it was before. Now, you’re afraid of your job and you hate yourself for it. This goes in a downwards cycle of anxiety and self-guilt until you end up both terrified and filled with self-loathing.",GAD

If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me.

To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
533,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
534,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
535,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD
536,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
537,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
538,"Since I cannot take any medication for my anxiety disorder, I practice meditation. I use a free app on my iPad called Insight Timer that has thousands of guided meditations and soothing music. There’s even a free class that teaches how to meditate. The problem with anxiety is that when I feel panicked my breathing becomes rapid, causing more anxiety. Meditation helps me slow down and focus on taking deep breaths, in through the nose, hold for a few seconds and release it. Doing this over and over for the length of time I choose my meditation teaches me how to acknowledge my thoughts then let them go, each time bringing them back to the breath. It’s been very effective and I can now manage the extreme emotional feelings in my life on a daily basis. Additionally i see a therapist and attend a 12 step recovery program because I became addicted to benzodiazepines used to treat my anxiety disorder.",GAD
539,"Managing symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) often involves a combination of therapeutic approaches and lifestyle changes. Some strategies include:
1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Learning to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.
2. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety.
3. Regular Exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.
4. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake can positively impact anxiety symptoms.
5. Stress Management: Learning effective time management, setting realistic goals, and practicing assertiveness can help manage stressors.
6. Social Support: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional comfort and reduce isolation.
7. Medication: Consult a psychiatrist about the potential benefits of anti-anxiety medications.
8. Avoidance Reduction: Gradually facing anxiety-provoking situations can help desensitize the fear response.
9. Journaling: Writing down thoughts and feelings can help gain insights and provide an outlet for emotions.
10. Professional Help: Consulting a mental health professional for guidance, support, and personalized treatment.
You should work closely with your healthcare provider or therapist to maximise this strategies to your advantage,whenever you feel anxious,its better to face it than seek a way of avoiding it or playing a victim

There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD

542,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.

544,"Living with GAD can feel exhausting, but there are ways to find relief. Taking deep, intentional breaths helps calm the racing mind while journaling your worries creates space for clarity. Therapy, especially Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), offers tools to challenge anxious thoughts. Practicing mindfulness or gentle movement, like yoga, can ground you in the present. It’s important to remind yourself that you’re not alone. Support can also help ease the weight of anxiety and bring moments of peace. I hope this helps.",GAD

Depending on how severe your condition is, GAD can be treated by Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or through medical approaches using medication. Or both.
The best way to determine what is right for you is to speak to a mental health professional, be it a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health counselor. You can even begin by seeing your regular physician for recommendations to a specialist.

546,"I am a chemical engineer suffering from anxiety probably since early childhood. I can think of several ways how the condition negatively affected me - development of my personality, my relationships (being completely shy and withdrawn around girls) and my physical health. And I can witness that meds (SSRI in my case) significantly improved quality of my life. Please give it a try.
As for the brain chemistry alteration, please note that these meds don’t “add” chemicals to your brain but prevent your brain from decomposing the serotonin.
Don’t go into the “hard” antidepressants that kick in immediately. As far as I understand it these should be used only in severe cases (e.g. tendency to commit suicide).
And if you decide to start with SSRI (with guidance of your psychiatrist of course) give them time of at least one month to make effect. In the beginning your condition might get worse and sleep disorders are almost sure thing. But the positive effects outweigh the negative.
Which are the positive effects?
Better mood, feeling more “myself”, better recognition of automatic negative thoughts and ability to work with them, better social interaction, improved ability to focus at work.",GAD
547,"The right treatment can often improve GAD. You and your health care provider should make a treatment plan that could include talk therapy (psychotherapy), taking medicine, or both.
Taking Medicine
Your provider may prescribe one or more medicines, including:
An antidepressant, which can help with anxiety and depression. This kind of medicine may take weeks or months to start working. It is a safe medium- to long-term treatment for GAD.
A benzodiazepine, which acts faster than an antidepressant to control anxiety. However, benzodiazepines can become less effective and habit forming over time. Your provider may prescribe a benzodiazepine to help your anxiety while you wait for the antidepressant to work.
When taking medicine for GAD:
Keep your provider informed about your symptoms. If a medicine isn't controlling symptoms, its dosage may need to be changed, or you may need to try a new medicine instead.
Do not change the dosage or stop taking the medicine without talking to your provider.
Take medicine at set times. For example, take it every day at breakfast. Check with your provider about the best time to take your medicine.
Ask your provider about side effects and what to do if they occur.
Therapy
Talk therapy takes place with a trained therapist. It helps you learn ways of managing and reducing your anxiety. Some forms of talk therapy can help you understand what causes your anxiety. This allows you to gain better control over it.
Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, your behaviors, and your symptoms. Often, CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:
Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.
Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.
Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.
Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.
Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.

548,"Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders & Panic Attacks
Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as emotional distress, pacing back and forth, shortness of breath, pain & fatigue.
It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death.
Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat.
Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing.
It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fast heart rate, rapid breathing or slow breathing, fatigue and problems in concentration.
Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.
People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.
""Anxiety Disorder""
Is a group of mental disorders characterise by significant anxiety and fear. It is different from common Anxiety.
For people who Anxiety Disorder, the worry and fear are constant and overwhelming. It can disable a person to do any thing.
But with treatment many people can manage those feelings and they can work normally.

Panic Attacks themselves are not dangerous. The treatment of Panic Attack is directed toward underlining cause.
Counselling & Breathing training and muscle relaxation techniques are quite help full in these patients.
In serious patients medical treatment is required by clinical Psychiatrist.
Anxiety is due to mind & body reaction to something which can cause fear or apprehension like exams, job interview and disturbances in love affair or relationship, if someone is seriously threatening you or in life threatening situations etc.
Anxiety can also be due to unknown reasons or due to imaginary things which are not real.
This will happen to people who have ‘Anxious Personality’.
Some people will become quite anxious even with trivial problems.
Some people will remain calm and confident even when they are facing big problems in their life. It depends upon Individual Personality.
Anxiety can be due to environment, circumstances, genetics, certain type of health problems, Caffeine ( drinking too much Coffee ), Alcohol, Drugs etc.
Physiologically Anxiety is caused by low levels of a Neurotransmitter called ‘GABA’. It reduces the activity in Central Nervous System ( Brain ).
Anxiety is common in Teenage Youngsters and in Young Adults.
Anxiety is a ‘Protective Mechanism’ given to you by the God. It prepares your mind and body for upcoming situation, threats or challenges in your life.
Anxiety is a normal human mind and body reaction to a difficult or odd situation.
Some people with ‘Anxious Personality’ have more anxiety compare to normal people.
Excessive Anxiety can cause ‘Panic Attacks’ or ‘Nightmares’.
Normally Anxiety will disappear after the difficult situation is over. But in few people it will persist for long time.
For mild to moderate grade of Anxiety Sports, Jogging, Meditation & Yoga exercises will be quite help.
You should concentrate your mind on pleasant thoughts & God when you are doing Meditation.
Reading Books on Positive Thinking & Positive Attitude will also help you.
If your Anxiety is persistent and bothering you too much, then it is advise to consult a qualified Psycho-therapist or a Clinical Psychiatrist.

549,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
550,"If you are seeing a mental health professional, ask them about the tapping technique. It involves tapping with two fingers on different parts of your torso, fingers,inner wrists,below your collar bone and below your armpit,ten times each. You'll be able to tell which area calms you the most. After the tapping, sing a short song like happy birthday or the ABCs, and count to ten while moving your eyes back and forth rapidly. It's believed that by doing this it balances both hemispheres of the brain,the creative(singing)and the logical (counting)and the eye movements imitate REM sleep. I know it sounds really bizarre, but with practice you can do this anywhere,and it really works well,especially when you don't have any anti-anxiety meds with you.",GAD
551,"There are three main options: talk therapy, medications, and electrical stimulation. A combination of these would likely be most effective. The right therapist can help you learn how to recognize faulty thought processes and teach you techniques to change your thinking and behavior patterns. The right medication(s) can go a long way towards helping you feel in control again. Electrical stimulation has long been known to be quite effective in treating anxiety and depression but was rather barbaric in its early days. Now we have more refined machines that can give you small pulses of electrical currents without being painful and without requiring hospitalization or anesthesia. The effects can be similar to benzodiazepines but can last longer and not come with any of the potential side effects. Another possibility is EMDR therapy, which is fabulous for treating PTSD but may also be beneficial in treating similar disorders.

553,"Here are a few things that have helped me:
No marijuana or any other psychoactive substance.
Minimize caffeine intake. This one is tough because caffeine does help me focus, so I keep it to a minimum and follow it up with water, which leads to
Stay hydrated.
Choose food wisely. Eat small meals at a time. Chew each at least some bites mindfully, and thoroughly, thinking about where that food came.
Go for walks, in nature, and don’t bring my phone. I have a watch for the time.
There are other things I do to take care of my physical being, like meditation and stretching, that when they are part of my daily rituals, I do even better.
tl;dr (for the rest of this): I monitor my thoughts, and choose to discontinue thoughts I deem unhelpful or contrary to my values.
Treating my physical body with love and respect is important and helpful, but the cognitive work I have done has provided the most relief. I spent many years thinking that external circumstances caused my anxiety. I did my best to avoid any situation that I deemed stressful. I rarely went to restaurants, concerts, or generally any social setting where I had to interact and negotiate with anybody, or where there were too many rules. As I got older, I got better at managing life (due greatly to the influence of my first wife), and I began to slowly recognize that I was feeling anxious even when my circumstances weren’t particularly stressful. Then one day, I had a particularly catalyzing event that made this truth undeniable, that my anxiety might be triggered by some external event, but the actual experience was some sort of chemical imbalance within me.
I was going to a festival with my daughter to deliver some supplies to a friend, and in exchange I would get in for free. The whole trip, everything was going perfectly. We were perhaps going to be 10 to 15 minutes later than I said, but the supplies weren’t need until later anyways. Traffic was perfect. We hadn’t forgotten anything. We had enough money to be comfortable. On the drive I began feeling intensely anxious. I kept looking for reasons why. Parking was going to be horrible because we were getting there late. At the time we were arriving, we’d probably have a 15 minute walk from the car in the heat. But we could drop the supplies at the gate no problem, then park. Did I remember what to bring? Yes I had everything. As we passed the volunteer parking lot right next to the entrance, the person at the gate recognized my daughter, called out her name, and waved us into a parking spot. We had gate side parking, in the shade, free passes, plenty of money, time with my daughter, friends, great music, a place to camp, all at one of my favorite festivals (because it’s small but exciting). I couldn’t find a single external reason to blame for feeling anxious. I had to accept that my anxiety is a state of being not dependent on circumstances. I had to accept that there is something wrong with me. That acceptance has made it much easier to make progress. Life is just life. I’m the one freaking out. This set the stage for the next step in reducing the impact of anxiety attacks on my life.
When I had to accept that external events were not causing my anxiety, and in fact were triggering them less and less as I got older and gained experience, I became more willing and able to examine my thought patterns. I love to let my mind wander. I love to fantasize. I write songs and stories and skits, and the wandering mind is a part of my creative process. One day, in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, I was driving along, fantasizing about how I could blow up the Goldman Sachs building. I was dreaming up ways of I could make it happen and maybe even get away with it. I noticed what I was thinking, and another part of myself asked out loud, do I really want to be thinking about that? It goes so completely contrary to my core values. I’m a pacifist. I don’t want to hurt anybody, even if they theoretically deserve it, which they almost never do. Why am I thinking about this? I could have made up the excuse that I was just fantasizing a plot line for yet another story I won’t write. What I really was doing was feeling powerless about the international financial crisis, and the fantasizing was a coping mechanism. I was also aware of how anxious I was feeling. The anxiety was causing me to latch on to the crisis as an excuse for what I was experiencing. I was driving too fast. I was twitchy and sketchy, fast breathing, things I experience when I’m anxious. The crisis wasn’t affecting me. I’m poor. I have no investments. I live in a poor county. I was almost completely unaffected by the financial crisis. Nothing much in my life changed. I was looking for an excuse as to why I was anxious, and the thoughts were adding to my anxiety, in a feedback loop.
So I started thinking about positive things, things were going good in my life, things I could do something about, and lo and behold, my anxiety lessened. It didn’t go away completely, it just had less influence over me. So that day, I made an agreement with myself. I’m going to start monitoring my own thoughts, and regularly ask myself, do I really want to be thinking about this? If the answer was yes, then think away. But if the answer was no, then think about something else. Typically, I would sing a song in my mind as a transition, then turn my thoughts towards something positive. It took me a couple of years to get good at it.
I still have panic attacks. I still am reluctant to put myself into certain situations even though it would benefit me. I avoid tasks that can trigger my anxiety, because it sucks. It feels awful. I hate it. But when it does happen, I know that it is a chemical, or perhaps electrical, imbalance within me. It’s as if I’m on a drug, and I will come down. I just have to ride it out, and meanwhile, think about things I like to think about. Think about things I have control over. I almost never take meds anymore. Only when it’s really bad and I have to function.",GAD

In fact, the present just IS, it has no meaning other than what we choose to project upon it. Oftentimes those projections suppose a “bad outcome” to our situation. This results in anxiety. If we can remain purely in the moment, in a mindful state, then all interpretations disappear. You can be mindful of your breathing, of the sounds of the forest, of the commotion of an urban street. If you are fully mindful there will be no space for anxiety. It takes a bit of practice but no drugs are necessary and there are no side effects!",GAD

Mindfulness-based meditation is the most common type of meditation used in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
Learning to detach from anxious thoughts is the foundation of the mindfulness-based stress reduction method. This is accomplished through exercising mindfulness, recognizing physical tension, understanding your thought patterns, and learning how to deal with unpleasant emotions.
Slowing down and seeing the world without judgement is possible when you practice mindfulness.
If you have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), mindfulness-based meditation can help you minimize anxious thoughts and achieve a sense of balance, calmness, and concentration.
Hope this helps!

561,"I love this question. If meditation and mindfulness is really good, people can just meditate instead of relying on antidepressants or continue suffering. My wife is suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. Not just saying, she is also on medication with diagnosis from doctors. There were several episodes of medication history too. Myself, I meditate 2 hours a day with 60 minutes in the morning and another one in the evening. I also invited my wife to join me in the past. By herself, she also went to a few different places to learn meditation. Although, meditation can really help, but for a person already with anxiety, they may have difficulty learning and applying it.
When my wife joined my meditation session, she would stop at around 15 ~ 20 minutes while I continue my 60 minutes session. It doesn’t matter how many times you tried. If you can not reach 60 minutes, basically, you are not getting any deep and real benefit. It was only a warm up, the real training didn’t begin from the 46th minute to the 60th minute. Our mind take time to settle. You don’t have to believe what I wrote here. Simply give it a try and experience the truth yourself. 60 minute is difficult and that is why it is beneficial. Don’t wish the world to become easier for you; rather wish yourself become stronger than yesterday.
The key to meditation is maintaining our equanimity and observing our breaths. When you can apply the practice correctly, an automatic purification process begin to happen. The instruction is simple but for people already suffer anxiety, with their strong opinion and their interpretation on meditation. They may not be following the instruction. There is a recipe on how to bake bread with ingredients, and timing. When a person is being egoistic smart and changing the recipe, the result is terrible tasting and indigestible breads. No imagination, no visualization, no breath counting/controlling, or mantra chanting. Only observing breath as it is.
The greatest suffering in life is not our own suffering; rather is watching our love ones suffering while we can’t do anything. I’d love my wife to become free from her paranoia, anxiety, panic attacks and medication. But there isn’t a thing I can do. She can’t commit 60 minutes to meditation, she can’t applied the right method for meditation. She can’t walk for 60 minutes to replace Zoloft pills. I can only see her suffering and continue to maintain my own equanimity.
Meditation is great but can be difficult to learn. Who wants to commit 2 hours a day? Who can maintain 60 minutes of equanimity with each session? Who is willing to go to a 10 day boot camp where you only get fed 1 vegetarian meal a day? Who can go through the sensory deprivation program at the meditation boot camp? Who can follow the moral codes? The truth is not many.
That’s why the pharmaceutical business is a great money making model. People can’t change their old habits. People can’t choose to live healthy. People are prisoners of their past conditioning. A pill however can solve the problem of anxiety attacks and make you feel calm despite with a dozen side effects including suicide and sexual dysfunction. A research shown 67% of men on Zoloft can’t even ejaculate. Never mess our brain chemistry with artificial chemical. That should be reserved for last and emergency option.
May all find their strengths within. May all discover they can transform all their miseries. May all determine to meditate despite all difficulties. You are stronger than you ever believe.",GAD

563,"A few days back, I read a book on depression ""Lost Connections"" by Johann Hari. The following paragraph really made me wonder:
""Today they are all around us. Some one in five U.S. adults is taking at least one drug for a psychiatric problem; nearly one in four middle-aged women in the United States is taking antidepressants at any given time; around one in ten boys at American high schools is being given a powerful stimulant to make them focus; and addictions to legal and illegal drugs are now so widespread that the life expectancy of white men is declining for the first time in the entire peacetime history of the United States.
These effects have radiated out across the Western world: for example, as you read this, one in three French people is taking a legal psychotropic drug such as an antidepressant, while the UK has almost the highest use in all of Europe. You can't escape it: when scientists test the water supply of Western countries, they always find it is laced with antidepressants, because so many of us are taking them and excreting them that they simply can't be filtered out of the water we drink every day. We are literally awash in these drugs.""
I was astonished to see such prevalent psychiatric disorders in the West which is far more wealthier than India. The entire world is running after money and power and the ones who already have it are more depressed than the ones who do not have it. In fact, even within India, my experience is that most of the patients with depression are from the rich class and the poor have more physical ailments and fewer psychiatric disorders. That brings a natural curiosity to my mind as to what is the fundamental cause of depression.
The author of the book has given a few reasons for depression including the following:-
disconnection from meaningful work
disconnection from the other people
disconnection from meaningful values
childhood trauma
crisis of respect
disconnection from nature
loss of hope
neurological changes
It struck me that all the reasons have a very fundamental similarity i.e. inner disconnection. The moment we lose that inner connection, we become restless and try to find meaning in one or the other thing. Some of us try to find meaning in the work, some in relationships, some in moral values (mostly in search of a tempting heaven or next birth), some in social validation, and some in imaginary future in the form of hope. We face different situations in our lifetime when things do not work the way we want. We face a crisis at the workplace and either our voice remains unheard or we are asked to do something that does not fit in our meaning of meaningful work. We face a crisis in relationships and people behave erratically or irrationally and there are constant conflicts in relationships making them unpleasant. We face the crisis of moral values when being good and behaving good becomes too burdensome like driving within the speed limit when every other vehicle is crossing the speed limit and honking ruthlessly. We also face a crisis of social validation when people are too mean and take credit for all the work we do or when society has a very different outlook. We feel a crisis of hope when things do not go our way for long and we are tired of waiting.
Can we see that all these crises are certain to come whenever we make some artificial meaning of life be it work satisfaction, strong relationships, morality, social validation, or hope? I feel that all these are just escape mechanisms because we are not able to bear the inner hollowness. We just try to make meaning around one or the other thing and naturally, that meaning exists only in our mind and therefore whenever there is a crisis, we feel depressed.
Can't we learn from the cumulative suffering of humanity and work on our inner hollowness rather than making one or the other meaning of life and then suffering the phases of stress, anxiety, and depression in moments of crisis? Why do we lay the foundation of such crises? Why not make the building of our lives crisis-proof? It does not need much effort but an honest inquiry into our true nature. We just need to observe what all these meanings, we have made, are doing to us and to society in general. If we are honest in our inquiry and observation, it will not take much time to realize that whatever meaning we make, everything will fall apart. It's just a matter of time. We are just waiting for a crisis to happen. The immunity of the body can't be replaced with antibiotics and painkillers. They provide immediate relief and that's fine but they are not a long-term solution to the health problems. Finally one needs to work on immunity. Similarly, whatever meaning we make of life may work in the short run. However, we need to reestablish that inner connection to do away with the hollowness and as a natural consequence of this inquiry into the inner hollowness, a space gets created which is filled with love and compassion. There is no space for stress and anxiety in an inner world full of love and compassion.",GAD
564,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
565,I believe it helps a lot. Mindfulness brings you out of your “reptile” brain and into the present. Anxiety lives in the reptile brain.,GAD
566,"Anxiety disorder has various characteristics as far as brain function is concerned and one of those is a poor serotonin function. Serotonin is a brain hormone in charge of sensory translation, sleep, relaxation, feeding, learning and even growth of new neurones.
A poor serotonin function is targeted with various SSRIs meds which will be helpful temporarily but will hardly modify how the brain produces serotonin.
Very solid scientific studies have demonstrated that meditation can increase serotonin production and improve its function so it clearly impacts the level of anxiety and its reduction on a long time basis.
The placebo effect is usually short term. It does modify how the brain responds to the environment and is a strong tool which also has been studied. It is hard to quantify its effect on anxiety as the anxious individual is in so much pain he or she cannot easily “fall” for a fake approach.
Meditation not only improves serotonin function, it also leads to a control of racing thoughts and a reduced impact of sudden triggers.

567,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

569,"Mindfulness meditation, or mindfulness, is, simply, being right here right now. Just be in the present second, then the next second, then the next, doing what you are doing and being aware of just what you are doing. If your mind starts to stray, forget about it. If your body starts getting emotional on you, let it go, let it wind down, let yourself relax—mindfully. And if that spurt of adrenaline hits you before you can help it, then mindfully work the adrenaline out of your system: go exercise mindfully, take a mindful bath in hot water up to your neck like the Japanese do—mindfully feeling it—or go walk in nature being mindful of whatever you see and hear. Or use whatever meditation technique helps you calm down, but do so mindfully, aware just of what you are doing, not letting any stray thoughts flying through the sky of your mind deter you from focusing on what you are doing.
That’s mindful meditation—all of those things. Mindfulness.
Good luck in practicing it! It does indeed help a person cope with anxiety and mild depression. For moderate to strong anxiety and/or depression, or long term (like several months or more), go see a doctor and do what s/he says. And you also can continue to meditate.

Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
573,"Mindfulness is a powerful tool to help manage anxiety because it focuses on grounding you in the present moment, reducing the grip of worry about the future or rumination about the past.
Here are some practical steps to incorporate mindfulness into your daily life:
1. Practice Deep Breathing-
When anxiety strikes, your breath often becomes shallow and rapid. Practice mindful breathing to calm your mind:
-Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of 4
-Hold your breath for 4 counts.
-Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 6.
-Focus solely on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.
2. Body Scan Meditation
A body scan helps you identify where tension is held in your body and encourages relaxation:
-Sit or lie down in a quiet place.
-Starting at your toes, slowly bring your attention to each part of your body, moving upward.
-Notice sensations without judgment, and gently release any tension you might feel.
3. Ground Yourself Using the 5-4-3-2-1 Technique
This technique anchors you in the present moment by engaging your senses:
-5 things you can see around you.
-4 things you can touch.
-3 things you can hear.
-2 things you can smell.
-1 thing you can taste or something you're grateful for.
Mindfulness won’t eliminate anxiety overnight, but with consistent practice, it can reduce its intensity and frequency. Over time, it trains your mind to respond to anxiety with calmness rather than reactivity.
If your anxiety feels overwhelming, don’t hesitate to seek support from a therapist who can guide you in combining mindfulness with other therapeutic techniques.",GAD
574,"Meditation is a training wheel for your mind. It sometimes feel like magic, but it’s really just practice. 2 things have worked for me:
Focus elsewhere : Meditation teaches you to focus on something steady and physically tangible, like where your breath is entering your body, or where your feet touch the ground. With practice, this allows you to distract from obsessive thoughts that could make you depressed, or anxious instead of getting caught up in them.
Distance yourself from your emotions: Meditation asks you to observe your emotions, make a note of them, and then go back to whatever you were focusing on. No trying to solve, no trying to judge. For example: If you are still wishing revenge on that person who cut in front of you at the ice cream store last Saturday, meditation asks you to note that you want revenge, not judge yourself for it, and go back to your breathing. Strangely this is much more effective that trying to make the feelings go away. Just naming and observing a problem, rather than fighting or solving it, can cause it to lose a lot of its power.
Compassion : The more you start just observing how you feel, instead of beating yourself up for it, the more you learn to like yourself.

575,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

576,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
577,"Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutras, likely would recommend what brings peacefulness to counter the anxiety. Thus he might suggest breathing exercises (pranayama), “hot” exercise (such as vigorous walking, running, very active physical yoga, etc.), and even perhaps spending more time in nature or, at least,, with the sights and/or sounds of nature. He also might recommend that you stay away from stimulants (in modern times, meaning you should avoid caffeine, large doses of sugar, et al.).
You want to pursue what calms you, makes you feel more peaceful, and is more steadfast and consistent in relaxing you. If you need talk therapy, then get that, too. If you can’t afford that, then use writing therapy—regular writing about your anxieties—which, in at least a few studies, has been shown to be almost as effective as talking to a counselor.
Good luck!

578,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)

579,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
580,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
581,"Benzodiazepines can effectively treat panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that reduces brain activity.

586,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

588,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
589,"I couldn't really say from a scientific/neurologist pov but as someone who overused Xanax for many years I can say that it's probable. I do know that I had generalized anxiety and depression before taking anything and when I first discovered Xanax it helped alot. I ended up becoming dependent and taking way more than I ever should have and when I didn't have any benzos n would slip Into severe withdrawal and seizure and of course horrible anxiety. I noticed that the more Xanax I'd take the worse off I'd be in the long run. It's not like Xanax building up in your system is helping combat the anxiety long term it's literally just a temporary band-aid. It just masks what's there and often times when. Your overusing these drugs you do things in your personal life that you normally wouldn't because your under the in influence and that can cause huge issues in life. Duis ,trouble with the law, ok ther addictions etc. Part of the recovery process form benzos is going to be abstinence from benzos and this will def bring up some burried anxiety and then some. For so long the only way I knew how to get thru it was to take a pill and with out it .y. Ody didn't know what to do but freak out. But as you get more time away from benzos your head starts to rebuild itself but I would say I definitely did some damage to myshortterm meneorry and coping skills.",GAD

If you can make it to a counsellor, you must be able to talk it out with someone; perhaps just through the phone at first. My panic disorder was so bad, that my doctor sent a nurse to come and take me to the doctor’s. I also have epilepsy, and the fear and the epilepsy (through lack of sleep) became a trigger for having epileptic seizures in public; the very worse thing that I could imagine!
So I feel for the person who has become addicted to benzodiazepines, and yet not gotten to the heart of panic/anxiety disorders!

592,"So I personally am diagnosed with a panic disorder and this question will be answered different ways by different people depending on where they stand. Benzodiazepines are well known for their addictive qualities and horrendous withdrawals when they are used long term. However, if they are used for short periods or in emergencies where an individual is having a severe panic attack they can be highly beneficial. I have been prescribed ativan for years, I take it very rarely, simply when I need it. I won't take it unless I am full blown having a panic episode where the panic keeps escalating regardless of the use of my coping techniques. I have a lot of panic attacks but I'm to the point of usually being able to battle them without prescription intervention (it is really tough to do but I know the implications of benzodiazepines long term so I always try to fight through them without using it). If I find myself to the point where it is very severe and my daily functioning is being limited to the point where I am having trouble working or leaving the house I may take them like once or twice a day for several days but that is it. Once the severe period is over I go back to not taking them again. So my final answer is yes it is beneficial for short term usage or in moderation, I find anything beyond that to be detrimental to the individual (addiction, withdrawing, medication reaches a plateau effect and becomes ineffective at the current dose, etc.) Hopefully my own personal experience has helped to answer your question.",GAD

597,"I had a doctor once describe them as “alcohol in a pill.” That's not a terrible analogy. They not only dull all your senses, but they can put an effective halt to feeling any emotion. In short benzo’s numb.
Also they don't actually stop anxiety, just temporarily suspend it. They won't resolve the issues that cause your anxiety, and they won't help you find coping methods for when it returns. And it always returns, especially so when you're treating it with benzodiazepines. If your anxiety is such that it's seriously impeding your life daily, and also prevent you from working on other behavioral issues, then they may be an effective short-term treatment.
If you are prescribed regular-dosing of benzos for anxiety, they can't be stopped just because you don't want to take them anymore. They must be tapered gradually (only under doctor supervision), because if you stop suddenly after taking them regularly - you can start having seizures. So in addition to being psychologically addictive they also cause physical dependency.
And I can promise (as an epileptic) that if you start having seizures your anxiety will only grow. If you can imagine randomly, no matter where you are or what you're doing, suddenly dropping to the ground and convulsing. It carries a generous heaping of anxiety all on its alone, in addition to whatever other anxiety you have. Plus I've hurt myself in all manner of unique ways during seizures - including biting off a large chunk of my tongue, putting my elbow through my fiberglass bathtub, and many more (seizure-induced injury is a topic in itself). Then benzodiazepines can become this positive-feedback loop, where if you don't take them then you can be fairly confident that you will have anxiety. This is true whether you start having seizures or not.
If you want to find a solution to your anxiety then it takes plenty of work. It's not an easy, half- ass type of approach. Taking benzodiazepines is effective in the short-term, but it's like when you take unnecessary antibiotics anytime you catch a sniffle - your anxiety will adapt to it and then benzos won't work at controlling it.
Try to figure out where your anxiety is coming from. Dealing with that is the only way to put an end to it. Plus learning how to manage it without pills will put a powerful, confidently-operating tool into your pocket that you can use to minimize problems from anxiety. I'd like to see an iPhone do that.
Good luck with managing your anxiety. It's not an easy thing to try and change, but once you figure out a way to you get that fancy new tool I mentioned (not for free, but won't cost you cash either).",GAD
598,"You’ll need medication.
If you’re suffering from Panic Disorder be sure to talk to a psychiatrist near you. You won’t be able to handle it on your own, but you also need to understand that no pill will solve everything, and it certainly won’t be an easy (or quick) fix. Medication can help you in the long run by helping to tackle your panic attacks, but after that you’ll still need to deal with it psychologically. My experience was having around 10 panic attacks within 24 hours, not sleeping, not eating, living my life in a single chair, watching the same shows, playing the same games, and generally just hiding from everything. After I got my panic attacks under control, I needed to re-train my brain to get out of the cycle and the little world which I had made. Even now I’m still getting over it, challenging myself to do things, breaking habits that I formed through my experience, etc.
An important thing to do is to reach out to friends or family and talk about what you’re going through — they can help you. Without the support of my family, I would have fallen into pits so deep that I couldn’t have been able to get out.
On top of that, there are all kinds of other things you can do to help tackle anxiety. Obviously everyone is different, for me two of the most helpful things were deep-breathing techniques and herbal teas.

600,"I am not a big believer that this class of medications is better than that class of medications in treating xyz.
Quite frankly in psychiatry, the only only medication that is proven to work better than others is the use of clozapine in the treatment of treatment refractory schizophrenia. In other works, no properly trained psychiatrists would argue that clozapine (Clozaril) does not work better than risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), olanzapine (Zyprexa), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda), and brexipiprazole (Rexulti).
By contrast, there is no scientific evidence (i.e. no head-to-head trials) that newer antidepressants (such has Viibryd and Trintellix) treat depression and anxiety better than older antidepressants (such as Prozac, Zoloft and Effexor).
Now, I believe that SSRI’s and SNRI’s in general are the fundamental treatment for anxiety disorder. Doctors would often prescribe benzodiazepine’s for short-term relief of anxiety until the antidepressants kick in for its anxiolytic effects or until the patients are able to find the right antidepressants for them, with the least amount of side effects.
Have I had patients who put in good faith effort and have tried 6–8 different antidepressants for their anxiety disorder and failed? Yes. They are now only taking benzodiazepines for their anxiety disorder. That does happen. But most doctors believe a good trial of antidepressants is needed before going the route of only relying on benzodiazepines such as Ativan, Klonipin or Xanax.",GAD

Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future

602,"I am the mother of 3 children…all grown. I had biological anxiety disorder. I remember having panic attacks at age 7 forward. I was 19 when I gave birth to child number one. I dont remember if my anxiety was affected but I was told by friends that I was so serious then and I used to be so much fun. With child two, I was in a better marriage and I had more support. With child 3, my husband had become an alcoholic. I did have much more anxiety with child 3 because I did not have his support and I got severe depression that later became bipolar 2. However with child 3, since I was medicated, I feel I was less stressed out and more patient .",GAD
603,"Of course there are mothers with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, just as there are fathers with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Contrary to popular belief, mental health problems don’t favor one gender over another. Women are far more likely to seek treatment, giving the appearance that women are affected more. Not so.
If the question you are trying to ask is something closer to “did becoming a mother (or better yet, parent) affect your GAD, and if so, how?” then that is one thing. Otherwise, let’s try not to “gender-ize” mental health problems. Doing so only adds to the stigmas attached to such problems and contributes to the fallacy that men are somehow less affected, making it less likely that all people who suffer anxiety problems will seek treatment.
I hope you find the answers you are seeking.

604,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
605,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

607,"It can be quite torturous. You strive to smile and pretend like you're not dying inside while you're in front of them. What really has worked wonderously for me is listening to my daughter talk. One day, while she was at school, I was overwhelmed with life's matters all jumbled up and crashing on my head. I felt i was on the brink of having a massive panic attack. My daughter is a car rider and we have no back up rides to get her. So I soldiered through my inner crisis and went to get her. All the while, I was thinking, “she's going to notice. I'm going to freak out in front of her.” the first thing I did when she got in the car was ask her how her day like I usually do. And I made it a point to fully listen and pay attention. No phone in hand. Driving carefully. She had failed a test a week prior and I wanted an update on some extra credit I requested from the teacher. We got home, I offered a snack, prepared what she requested and realized I wasn't a sitting duck paralyzed by my anxiety. Normally, I'd just plop down, check my phone and wait until she asks for something. As soon as I served her her meal BAM! She pulls outher headphones to watch YouTube as she ate. For a tiny second, I almost let myself get lost. But instead of spiralling back into that mental darkness and laying down and getting on the phone, I noticed the dishes and did em. It wasn't so hard to do. It's a beautiful moment when you your own child can save you from yourself. We won't always have our go-to's when the anxiety starts turning into panic, but fight to find what can give you these little moments. Pay attention! Make something NOT about you. You'll be surprised and at ease in those moments when you can get out of your own head.",GAD
608,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,

609,"I have 3 intertwining anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, and Derealization/Depersonalization), so my symptoms often overlap and feed into each other. Also, physical and psychological symptoms often go together, but I will try to narrow them down to be more specific. These are some of my psychological symptoms:
Overthinking (worrying about the past/future). I can’t stop thinking about things that worry me and I will over-analyze an event, moment, or comment to the point of even having an anxiety attack.
“Fortune-telling” (worrying about the future). This symptom is what happens when you start imagining all the bad things that could happen and goes along with overthinking. It usually happens before I go out or meet with friends. At my worst, my thinking could get so negative that I find myself not going places because of this.
Feeling extremely irritable, angry, restless. I can usually tell when my anxiety is acting up when I feel uncomfortable for “no reason”, (but the reason is that I have anxiety). When I’m like this, it’s easier for me to get overwhelmed and I often have the need to withdraw from socializing.
Feeling “on edge” or jumpy, getting scared easily.
“Automatic thinking”. Most of the psychological symptoms stem from “automatic thoughts,” which are negative thoughts or assumptions that quickly pop-up in your mind and leave you with a severe feeling of dread or make you apprehensive to do things.
Lack of concentration. Not being able to understand people/things around you because you have so much going on in your mind.
These are a few that I could think of. Although it’s really hard to deal with all aspects of anxiety, what makes it harder is when the physical symptoms accompany the psychological ones. So you don’t only think certain things, but you feel certain ways when you think them.
I hope this helped.",GAD
610,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.
To completely answer your question: it’s very likely the child will grow up and realise people don’t worry and fret about things as much as they do. This will make them realise they’re different and their GAD contrasts them from how other people think.",GAD
611,"That is a very good question. I suffer from anxiety/bipolar. Yes, I have been anxious my entire life and it did seem normal. It has always had a tremendous impact on my life. When the impact is inescapable, that is what will push someone to get help.
When I reached a point that I was crying all of the time, non-stop, and it effected my ability to get along with co-workers, and I had panic attacks every night and throughout the day, then getting help was unavoidable. The unfortunate part is that the treatment I received was only for depression, and the meds actually made the anxiety worse. Eventually, I was treated also for anxiety, and the meds actually made the anxiety/mania worse. Finally, I was diagnosed with bipolar and the meds were appropriately balanced out. It took a long time to arrive, but I am glad that I finally got the help that I needed!",GAD
612,"My mother had a severe anxiety disorder which was untreated by a doctor but she self medicated with alcohol. I was very different in that I was more like my father who was gregarious, outgoing, excited and had a very positive attitude about life. The result was my mother was mostly absent.
She was not able to “ mother” me. She and I were too different. Thank God for my grandmother who lived with us while I was growing up who was able to step in as best she could. One of the other area’s where the anxiety was evident was she was unable to show up for my special events. The events and people were too anxiety provoking. The last big area that affected me because of my mother’s anxiety was she was constantly telling me not to do things I wanted to do, not to go places I wanted to go, or not to try things I wanted to try. I did them anyway and this always caused a riff.
My mother got sober when I was 17, believe it or not it had never been mentioned in our house before the day she went to rehab. The word anxiety was never mentioned either. My mother and I were able to start having a friendship when I was in college and it continued until her death at 71. We did come to an understanding over the years. She was not going to be able to change my curiosity for life and I was not going to be able to change her anxiety.",GAD
613,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
614,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
615,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

616,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
617,"I got the diagnosis less than a week ago, I'm 16 years old but my GAD started way before. There were plenty of situations since I was a little kid for my parents to worry about something being of on me but I guess they just brushed it of.
For example:
From ages 3 to 5 my parents couldn't go out without me because I would totally freaked out and believed that they were going to abandon me. But I totally hated going out.
When I was in kinder I used to cry all day long in school. I couldn't see anybody in the eyes and couldn't talk with my teacher nor my classmates because I was afraid of them judging me.
In elementary school I isolated myself, couldn't talk in class and would freaked out, and sometimes ran away of class, if I needed to talk in front of everybody.
When I was 12 I started experience mild anxiety attacks for almost everything, when I had one I would freeze still and I couldn't move nor talk.
And then everything went downhill.
Sorry for my grammar, English isn't my first language.",GAD
618,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.

620,"I cannot confidently say that I have overcome panic attacks fully. I developed panic while I was on treatment for depression and anxiety way back in the late seventies. At that point the treatment for depression and for that matter any mental disorder was very limited . Only in the nineties it improved after the discovery of SSRIs and new benzodiazepines starting with alprazolam. SSRIs and benzodiazepines helped me to overcome depression and panic attacks for a long time . In 2017 ,the toll of taking these medications began to show up due to weight gain and water retention to mention two of the prominent side effects. I was forced to go off the medications cold turkey resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms. These included panic attacks which forced me to go to the emergency department of a hospital near my house 3 times. It took 4 years or so to get over the ill effects of stopping these medications. Thought I am feeling near normal with no signs of depression or severe anxiety, there are occasional panic attacks which I go through. I keep myself in good general health so as to get over occasional panics.Homeopathy and a balanced life help me to remain fit and cope .",GAD

622,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
623,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
624,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
625,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
626,"I’ll share an experience I had with a patient 3 years ago.
She was 25, lawyer, homosexual but married to a man of her parents’ choice a year before. And she was persistently anxious, restless, apprehensive, jittery, low on confidence, distracted, unable to focus on work, repeatedly arguing with her husband, and resultantly feeling sad, disinterested, and frustrated with everything. The Family physician was not aware of the entire history and had diagnosed her with anxiety based on her symptoms and put her on benzodiazepines. She used them for four months continuously because they helped her feel better and her anxiety was at bay. But the moment she stopped the meds, the anxiety was back.
When she approached me, she was very clear that she was not going to be taking benzodiazepines. As a psychiatrist practicing cognitive techniques with a humanistic approach, we first got to the root of her anxiety. There were also other specific phobias like fear of close spaces and social apprehensiveness. Personally in my opinion, benzodiazepines offer symptomatic relief. In practice I prescribe them only in SOS situations when the anxiety and panic has hit, and the situation has become catastrophic. The appropriate management of anxiety lies in preventing it. And so we devised a cognitive behavior therapy protocol.
I did recommend a short course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for a period of six weeks while also simultaneously working with cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness techniques. The approach was somewhat like this.
Building a good rapport and getting the clients trust
In-depth analysis and a detailed history of symptoms
Understanding social and environmental implications
Identifying cognitive distortions and irrational expectations
Teaching mindfulness and self-awareness techniques
Tracking of moods to lookout for anxiety/ panic triggers
Identifying thoughts that contribute to negative emotions
Identifying crisis triggers and teaching crisis management
Building a assertiveness and self expression techniques
Roping in her family and husband for psycho education
Relaxation and systematic desensitization techniques
All this under cover of short dose of SSRI medication
Benzodiazepines offered as SOS medication for panic
Regular and timely follow-up’s and therapy sessions
She improved over the couple of months, SSRI medication was tapered off and she followed up for maintenance therapy at less frequent intervals. Until one fine day, she said “Doc, I’m fine”. I asked her when last did she feel like this. I reminded her that she had felt fine with the benzodiazepines even the last time around just a few months ago.
To which she replied:
“The last time around, my symptoms were controlled because of the medication. This time my anxiety has been dealt with from the root. The manner in which I approach things, the way I challenge my irrational thoughts and expectations, the assertiveness with which I communicate, the deep breathing and relaxation techniques that I use to calm myself, and the new life that I have now been able to create and live, itself inspires me to believe that I am absolutely empowered and then I can deal with most challenges that come my way. Hence I feel that I am healed.”
Since before that and more so now, I believe that cognitive techniques like thought restructuring, thought review, root cause analysis, rational emotive behavior therapy, self-monitoring, mood tracking, mood regulation, contingency management, systematic desensitization, deep breathing and relaxation and introspection are all targeted at the cortical level and the top down approach in anxiety management. The use of medication like benzodiazepines is a subcortical approach or the bottoms up method wherein the root cause of the problem is never solved. But these take more time, energy, commitment and patience on part of the treating professional and patient.
While the approach is always going to be different for different individuals, in general I am a believer of cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness techniques for coping with anxiety. And I personally advise benzodiazepines at the minimum.",GAD
627,"If it’s the only thing that works for you to live a normal, functional life and the pros outweigh the cons, then in my personal opinion and experience the answer is no. I’ll tell you a little of my personal history and why I am proof that benzodiazepines could help you lifelong.
first I’ll tell you I’m on both Alprazolam/Xanax 2mg 3 times daily and Adderall 15mg 2–3 times daily as needed. Have been for 16 years now.
I have been told that with my current psychological health issues that’s progressed over the course of a decade as well as the medications I’ve been taking to curb these symptoms since 2006, that if I were ever to stop my current mental health medication Alprazolam 2mg 3 times daily, even a slow, gradual taper, that without it I would have to be committed to one for the rest of my life. I’m diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, chronic stage insomnia, ADHD combined type, psychiatric disorder unknown type, anxiety/PTSD induced psychogenic seizure disorder, (or PNES) for short, and am currently managing it with only two medications. Adderall ir 15mg 2–3 times daily or as needed for my ADHD, and Alprazolam/Xanax 2mg 3 times daily for my anxiety, PTSD, and psychogenic seizures.
the reasoning for me is that due to my vast trial and error of the majority of failed mental health medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, sedative-hypnotics, SSRI, and SNRI medications, I was put on benzodiazepines as a last resort for helping what was going on with me. It ended up saving my life, however years later I’ve witnessed some of the most sinister, disgusting and horrific things anyone could ever experience, plus I have been a victim of something I’d rather not mention nor ever think of again, but long story short, those terrible, horrible things I’ve seen with my own eyes combined with the near death experience and torture I’d encountered brought permanent changes and unforgettable, reoccurring thoughts and psychological issues into my life. My insomnia was turned into nonexistent sleep, scared of what I’d dream about when asleep, and when I did fall asleep I’d have the same reoccurring night terrors but they weren’t fabricated or something that’ll never happen, they were an exact reoccurrence of the traumatic experiences I’ve experienced, encountered and endured a few years back… (I don’t know anything but what my wife and family had told me about it) but I’d awaken, thrash around screaming incoherent sentences and pleas for help while kicking, punching and squealing) it had subsided after being taken to the ER via ambulance and given a sedative. I was then diagnosed with “psychogenic seizure disorder” where you witness or are the victim of something so severe and horrific that you go into a complete catatonic state, to where you’re not in your own time and place, you’re literate mentally transmitted back to that exact moment, place and time to where you think it’s actually happening again..
I’ve had a few since then and anything can trigger it such as a screech, a certain type of laughter, night terrors and noises, and it has gotten to where now even heightened anxiety can cause it. I have warning signs now which are numbness in my right arm and partial or complete vision loss. It means I’m minutes or sometimes hours from having one. I’ve had a few more since and every time I’ve done something different. Sometimes I’ll just stare with my eyes wide as golfballs and murmur things, I’ll start ranting and convulsing terribly laughing or crying, etc. for reasons I had to change pcp providers and my meds were cut in half. As soon as that happened I’d had 13 catatonic stupors, and 4 actual seizures.
finally I sought counseling and got put on a stable dose of medication.
but because of my mental health off my medication and the type of medication I take, the dose and the amount of time I’ve been on it, my original psychiatrist told me that if I were to ever get off, even what they call a “safe, long taper” and my already deteriorated mental state, I’d no longer be able to function in normal society without constant care and needs. I would have to be admitted into a psychiatric institution or have someone care for me, and that’s why I refuse to get off my medication. Am I dependent on it? Absolutely, but for good reasons obviously stated. As long as you don’t abuse it, and the benefits outweigh the risks, I say fight to maintain your health and safety. I hope this helped you!",GAD
628,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster. For more information about medications and purchasing, visit my quora profile.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.",GAD
629,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
630,"Developed first for military snipers they calm the nervous system.
Which one you need could be a process of trial and error.
I took lorazepam/Ativan for a few years off and on. I often took 3 or 4 times the recommended dose.
Most psychiatrists will now not want you on these for the long term due to potential problems in extended use, and the likely eventuality is that you'll develop a strong dependence on them.

633,"Benzodiazepines can effectively treat panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that reduces brain activity. This leads to calming effects on the central nervous system, alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, benzodiazepines are typically prescribed for short-term relief due to the risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. They are not recommended for long-term use unless other treatments have been ineffective. For more details on the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety disorders, you can explore my Quora Profile.",GAD

636,It sucks to be dependent on anything but I totally understand. Without my benzo I would not have a life. I have tired lots of meds with no luck. Weigh your options… something that helps or be miserable and anxious. Life is to short to be anxious and miserable all the time so if it helps and your not abusing it then I see no problem.,GAD
637,"Both.
By different mechanisms.
SSRIs, specifically Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, and Viibryd, have been FDA approved for, and are generally considered the standard of care for, generalized anxiety disorder. The other SSRIs, and related SNRIs (Effexor, Cymbalta, Prostiq), are also frequently used off-label. However, all of these take a fair amount of time to really take effect, often several weeks.
What complicates the use of SSRIs further is that there is often a temporary increase in anxiety before there is improvement. (The sudden increase in serotonin is responsible, until the body can create more receptors to recalibrate.)
This is where benzodiazepines come in. Benzoes, for short, such as Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Klonopin, are very effective in the short-term. They work right away in decreasing anxiety, but they can make people loopy, tired, forgetful, and they carry an addiction potential.
Really the best strategy, from a pharmacologic perspective, is to start an SSRI and a long-acting benzo at the same time. The benzo will take the immediate edge off, and combat any possible side effects of the SSRI, until the SSRI can kick in. After a few weeks, the benzo can be tapered off.
Hope this helps.",GAD
638,"I had a doctor once describe them as “alcohol in a pill.” That's not a terrible analogy. They not only dull all your senses, but they can put an effective halt to feeling any emotion. In short benzo’s numb.
Also they don't actually stop anxiety, just temporarily suspend it. They won't resolve the issues that cause your anxiety, and they won't help you find coping methods for when it returns. And it always returns, especially so when you're treating it with benzodiazepines. If your anxiety is such that it's seriously impeding your life daily, and also prevent you from working on other behavioral issues, then they may be an effective short-term treatment.
If you are prescribed regular-dosing of benzos for anxiety, they can't be stopped just because you don't want to take them anymore. They must be tapered gradually (only under doctor supervision), because if you stop suddenly after taking them regularly - you can start having seizures. So in addition to being psychologically addictive they also cause physical dependency.
And I can promise (as an epileptic) that if you start having seizures your anxiety will only grow. If you can imagine randomly, no matter where you are or what you're doing, suddenly dropping to the ground and convulsing. It carries a generous heaping of anxiety all on its alone, in addition to whatever other anxiety you have. Plus I've hurt myself in all manner of unique ways during seizures - including biting off a large chunk of my tongue, putting my elbow through my fiberglass bathtub, and many more (seizure-induced injury is a topic in itself). Then benzodiazepines can become this positive-feedback loop, where if you don't take them then you can be fairly confident that you will have anxiety. This is true whether you start having seizures or not.
If you want to find a solution to your anxiety then it takes plenty of work. It's not an easy, half- ass type of approach. Taking benzodiazepines is effective in the short-term, but it's like when you take unnecessary antibiotics anytime you catch a sniffle - your anxiety will adapt to it and then benzos won't work at controlling it.
Try to figure out where your anxiety is coming from. Dealing with that is the only way to put an end to it. Plus learning how to manage it without pills will put a powerful, confidently-operating tool into your pocket that you can use to minimize problems from anxiety. I'd like to see an iPhone do that.
Good luck with managing your anxiety. It's not an easy thing to try and change, but once you figure out a way to you get that fancy new tool I mentioned (not for free, but won't cost you cash either).",GAD
639,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common mental health condition characterized by excessive worry and anxiety that persists for extended periods and interferes with daily life. Fortunately, several effective medication classes can help manage GAD symptoms. Here's an overview of some commonly prescribed medications:
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):
First-line treatment: SSRIs are often the first-line medication class for GAD due to their effectiveness and tolerability.
How they work: SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood regulation. By enhancing serotonin activity, they can alleviate anxiety symptoms like excessive worry, tension, and restlessness.
Examples: Common SSRIs used for GAD include escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil).
Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):
Alternative option: SNRIs can be an alternative for those who don't respond well to SSRIs.
Mechanism of action: SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs but additionally affect norepinephrine, another brain chemical influencing mood and alertness.
Examples: Venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are SNRIs commonly prescribed for GAD.
Buspirone:
Unique mechanism: Buspirone works differently from SSRIs and SNRIs. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to influence specific neurotransmitters involved in anxiety.
Slower onset: Unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, buspirone typically takes several weeks to show its full effects.
Advantage: Buspirone is less likely to cause some common side effects associated with SSRIs and SNRIs, such as sexual dysfunction and sedation.
Benzodiazepines:
Short-term relief: Benzodiazepines are fast-acting medications that provide short-term relief from anxiety symptoms.
Use with caution: Due to their potential for dependence and addiction, benzodiazepines are typically only prescribed for short-term use or in specific situations like managing severe anxiety during a panic attack.
Examples: Alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are some commonly used benzodiazepines.
Choosing the Right Medication:
The best medication for GAD depends on individual factors like:
Severity of symptoms
Medical history
Response to previous medications
Potential side effects
It's important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for your individual needs.
They can also monitor for side effects and adjust the medication regimen as needed.
Additional Considerations:
Non-medication approaches: Therapy, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle changes can be helpful alongside medication in managing GAD.
Combination therapy: In some cases, a combination of medication classes or medication with therapy might be necessary for optimal symptom control.
By working with a healthcare professional and exploring different treatment options, you can find an effective approach to manage GAD symptoms and improve your quality of life.",GAD
640,"Actually,no. For benzodiazepines (Klonopin, Valium, Xanax etc), the approved and appropriate way to prescribe any benzodiazepine (BZD) is for use intermittently only for a maximum of 2 to 4 weeks. There’s a lot of very sloppy, ineffective medical prescribing of BZDs by physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants regarding BZDs. I have always called BZDs “go-away medicine”, prescribed by a medical provider and given to a patient to get him/her out of the office(“go-away”) to get the next patient into the office for a quick office visit. Because the body rapidly “becomes use to” the current prescribed dose, that dose begins to be less effective for the relief of the anxiety pretty quickly necessitating an increased dose of the BZD, which then, after the body’s adaption to that dose, requires another increased dose and on it goes until the maximum prescribing dose is reached. As I’m sure you know, the dangers of using BZDs outweigh their use longer than 4 weeks. In essence there’s a lot of negatives and no long-term efficacy.
The “rebound” anxiety that someone, who has been taking BZD’s for a period of time and is being slowly weaned down, experiences can be very difficult, unpleasant and drawn-out. The way to treat anxiety disorders with scientifically validated positive results, especially for long-term management, is through the use of antidepressants. The side effects are much more easily managed, long-term use with efficacy has been noted and they are far, far less addictive than are the BZD. But, it all boils down to the fact that the most effective way to manage anxiety, in the short-term and the long-term is through the use of antidepressants.",GAD
641,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
642,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
643,"There are several including Paroxetine. Escitalopram and Venlafaxine - but….. rule number 1. DO NOT take advice about stuff like this from some random stranger on the internet. There are MANY factors that have to be considered here.
These include, who diagnosed this condition and why? Is it correct or is it perhaps a manifestation of a physical problem - thyroid perhaps?
So, my strongest advice is - don’t take my advice! Go and see your GP (primary care Dr)- they will know what to do (hopefully) if you have doubts, or if they recommend it - go and see a specialist.
Hope you feel better soon - anxiety is horrible!",GAD
644,"Staying in therapy weekly long-term is crucial and asking the therapist specifically to help you learn how to fully feel your feelings when you are outside of therapy.
The reason this is important is because anxiety is a symptom of stuffing your sadness and anger. This is learned in childhood when parents don’t validate their children’s feelings or talk about unpleasant feelings.
so you need to learn to sit with the feeling, literally sit still, notice your body sensations, tell yourself how you’re feeling, and then learn to validate your own feeling. Again, talk to a therapist about this.
you should also talk to your therapist about inner child work and consider ACA 12 step program to do the grief work because you have stuck grief from your childhood as well that needs to be processed or it will continue to show up as anxiety
meditation and yoga are very powerful as well. They say if you have trouble sitting still meditating it means you should be doing it twice as much.
journaling is really good too, especially before bed if you have trouble sleeping",GAD
645,"I agree with the other posters, that you would be best off getting advice from a psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist (I am a doctor, but not in either of those specialities).
For what it’s worth, my opinion is that you’d be best off avoiding benzodiazepines entirely for the anxiety/depression/psychosis. Although good short-term treatment for anxiety, benzodiazepines worsen depression in the long term, and have no intrinsic anti-psychotic effect. Sure, they are OK anticonvulsants for acute seizures; but there are better ones for long-term control. (Also, your question implies that the patient doesn’t actually have seizures, but merely an abnormal EEG; not sure whether this even requires treating - hence ask a neuropsychiatrist).
Good luck - it sounds like your patient is living with a horrible condition - I hope you find what you’re looking for!",GAD
646,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions
If you or anyone you know have any doubts about having mental health issues, I advice you to get it checked by a psychiatrist. It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders

647,"OCD hasn’t from my personality. It comes from way I was raised. Eldest of 6 cleaning house and cooking by 9. My narcissistic family believed it was my duty. Mormon values. Hoarders and gamblers. Life is all about winning for them. A schizophrenic uncle whose suicide was also blamed on me. I have anxieties in public places. Hate using public restrooms. Covid changed my life. Always an introvert I went into therapy and became obsessed with understanding what drives the mind to become unstable. Hypnotherapy completing changed my life. Now helping others be true to themselves and not controlled by the narcissistic family you may have been born into. Had to get away. Before they literal gave me a heart attack. Was I born OCD? Maybe in the genetics as well for my father and his mother were also OCD. I’ve always been an introvert trying to be one of the group. Love listening to people’s stories. Using my experiences and training to help the children or spouses in homes with domestic violence. Now an activist on social media for the future of my granddaughters. Mental health is in crisis in US.
Mental health awareness can teach us all how to deal with our anxieties. Narcissistic personalities must be avoided by O CD individuals.
Living a stress free life, gardening and cooking. Gorgeous sunsets and sunrises. May seem selfish to them. To me it is freedom to be the holistic minister I was born to be.
I still love having my kitchen appliances shiny and streak free. My kitchen. My rules. If it isn’t spotless we get sugar ants. So I have a good reason to be OCD in my kitchen and bathrooms. Obsessive compulsive personalities have OCD!",GAD
648,"While GAD and OCD share some similarities, they are distinct disorders with unique symptoms and diagnostic criteria. GAD involves excessive worry and generalized anxiety, whereas OCD is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Both require tailored treatment approaches. Explore my Quora Profile for more discussions on anxiety disorders.",GAD
649,"In theory, yes. But in reality, it's rather hard to tell the difference.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is about excessive, uncontrollable worry about a variety of “normal” topics, such as health, finances, relationships, personal safety, etc. GAD sufferers may just simply worry about everything. It's basically the clinical manifestation of an intense “worry wart.”
OCD that is purely obsessional, also know as “Pure-O” OCD, is different, mainly in that obsessions are supposed to be about absurd or unrealistic fears, and sufferers usually have one main obsession, sometimes a couple of them, or at least one at a time.
Again, in reality, there is so much overlap between the idea of a realistic worry and an unrealistic obsession, that it's often hard to tell the difference.
The folk psychological terms used in mental health diagnosis are largely vague and subjective, so they are tricky. But they are consistent enough that research and treatment have honed in on some familiar patterns, enough to make a dent in problematic symptoms, at least some of the time.
In the end, GAD and Pure-O are similar in their shared perseverative, cognitive form of anxiety. But they differ in their degrees of focus and realism.
Someone could definitely have both and experience both unusual or extreme obsessions, and simultaneously worry tremendously about everyday things.",GAD
650,"Anxiety disorders is the umbrella term for a group of mental health disorders such as:
Generalized anxiety disorder (gad)
Obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd)
Panic disorder (pd)
Post traumatic stress disorder (ptsd)
And so on.
GAD is a disorder where one constantly worries about…anything and everything. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense.
OCD, on the other hand, is a disorder with two main characteristics: obsessions and compulsions.
Obsessions are intrusive throughts that something bad will happen. Compulsions are the actions that one does to “prevent” the obsessions. (of course neither the obsessions neither the compulsions make sense).
Here's an example: “If I don't touch turn on and off the lamp 3 times, I'll die"".
OCD is also quite often characterized with fear of germs, viruses and dirt. This will make the person to wash their hands too many times, become obsessed with cleaning and they might as well end up being hypochondriac.
I hope this helped :)",GAD
651,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
652,"The main difference is whether it’s an impediment or a characteristic.
What makes them different is that one is ego-syntonic and the other is ego-dystonic.
Ego-syntonic refers to instincts or ideas that are acceptable to the self; that are compatible with one's values and ways of thinking. They are consistent with one's fundamental personality and beliefs.
Ego-dystonic refers to thoughts, impulses, and behaviors that are felt to be repugnant, distressing, unacceptable, or inconsistent with one's self-concept.
Individuals with OCD have frequent, upsetting thoughts (obsessions) that they try to control by repeating particular behaviors —compulsions. The obsessions create a great deal of anxiety because they are not only intrusive and unwanted but also recurrent. OCD is ego-dystonic; the obsessions are against what the person wants. Although people with OCD may know that their thoughts and behaviors don’t make logical sense, they’re often unable to stop them.
Individuals with OCPD tend to think their way of doing things is the “right and best way,” and they are fixated with following set procedures or routines in their work or daily living, even when these routines are inefficient. These individuals tend to be overly controlling of their environments or relationships, wanting others to conform to the strict rules they set. OCPD is ego-syntonic because the obsessions and compulsions are at the service of the ego. OCPD includes perfectionism —at the expense of openness, flexibility, and efficiency,— rigid following of moral or ethical codes, hoarding behaviors, and an excessive fixation with lists and rules.
Most personality disorders are ego-syntonic, because in most cases, the person experiencing the disorder doesn't necessarily think they have a problem, and instead, think that the problem resides in everyone else.",GAD
653,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
654,"Yes, individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often also suffer from other anxiety disorders, such as social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and panic disorder. These comorbid conditions can complicate the diagnosis and treatment process. Integrated treatment approaches that address all co-occurring disorders are essential for effective management. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly exposure and response prevention (ERP), is effective for OCD and can also help with other anxiety disorders. Medications like SSRIs can be beneficial for both OCD and generalized anxiety. For more information on managing co-occurring anxiety disorders, you can explore my Quora Profile.",GAD
655,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
656,"Hi Peter,
For other readers, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions).
The difference in OCD and generalized anxiety is that OCD is completely based on taught impulsive behavior. Fears can also be based on taught impulsive behavior and/or can be stimulated by formulating fearful conscious thoughts to create new or follow fearful impulsive behavior.
Let’s handle this in simple and clear words to understand OCD and anxiety.
Conscious thoughts are thoughts you formulate in the present moment. You can choose to formulate negative thoughts which makes you fearful and you can choose to formulate positive thoughts which makes you fearless. Negative thoughts are Not good for you, others or Nature. Positive thoughts are good for you, AND others, AND Nature.
When you create negative thoughts, you experience negative emotions and have upset, bad and sad feelings. When you create positive thoughts, you experience positive emotions and have happy, good and great feelings.
What is a guidance of God for Man, to shift your thoughts from negative unto positive thoughts to feel happy and good again. To evolve in life.
Example, you walk alone in the dark through a forest. You can formulate thoughts like, something bad can happen, someone can rob me, a wild animal can attack me, a ghost can appear and scare me, etc. All these negative thoughts are fearful thoughts and shall create a fearful emotion and makes you feel upset, bad or sad. And doesn’t change the situation, in your panic and fearful thoughts, it can lead you to start to run in fear, to fall and hurting yourself by uncontrolled actions.
When you shift your conscious thoughts of negative into positive thoughts, you create fearless thoughts. You shift your focus from a negative expectation in a near future into confident, positive and fearless thoughts for your near future. For example, walking in the dark through a forest. You enjoy the conversations you had that night with others. You look forward to arrive home, you enjoy the forest at night in this different experience. You love the sounds of the forest. You trust your other senses helping you to find your path back home. You start to think about your future, your girlfriend. You make a game to stay on the path in the dark based on feeling and listening to the crunches of the little stones on the path, etc. You shall feel happy, good and fearless, because you chose to focus on positive conscious thoughts. If something negative would happen, you are fearless, calm and positive, to make right, loving and good decisions.
Subconscious thoughts.
Subconscious thoughts are created in your memory by focusing with emotion and/or repeating conscious thoughts in your life. Subconscious thoughts are connected by your synapses unto memory, belief system or even called your perspective at life. This is just the way we learn in life.
Everything you sense in life such as see, read, watch, hear, smell, taste and feel, are thoughts. What thoughts you repeatedly experience and focus on becomes subconscious thoughts in your memory.
Triggers
These subconscious thoughts in your mind are accessible by triggers. Triggers are also thoughts as pictures, events, letters, numbers, words, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, etc. Which are connected by synapses in your brain to other subconscious thoughts. When you hear a music, other thoughts which are connected by the synapses to subconscious thoughts, shall light up in your conscious Awareness and you shall remember other thoughts that are connected with this trigger of music. When you hear a word like Sun as a trigger, the most used synapses that is connected to the word, Sun, lights up in your conscious Awareness and shall be remembered. Sometimes when we think harder, we can even find the subconscious thoughts of weaker connected synapses. Subconscious thoughts and synapses, we did not use so much in life.
If we use a combination of two or more triggers at the same time, then the synapses that connects to subconscious thoughts together, light up in your memory. This is the way we can remember things in life and make sense in our thoughts.
In a human life we create, by formulating or experiencing conscious thoughts of ourselves, others or in life, our subconscious memory and personality.
Behavior
Behavior are the thoughts we have created in our memory as our perspective at life and we act accordingly on our thoughts.
We can act in the present moment on conscious thoughts, what means we decide with free will and choice in the present moment. What thoughts we formulate to think, how we like an experience in a present moment or what to do next, etc.
Our behavior can be expressed as an act or thought in a conscious or a subconscious way. A conscious way is to make a choice in life, that expresses our behavior. A subconscious way is to act impulsively, what expresses our impulsive behavior. Of course, most of conscious and subconscious ways are morphed together by Man and seems very complex and difficult. But, as you see, it doesn’t have to be this way.
For example. The most recognizable form of OCD, this type involves obsessions about things being in precisely the right place or symmetrical, to check or do something more fold, to be obsessive with dust, etc.
What happens here, is when someone starts to place something in a symmetrical way, and repeat this every day. What gives them a content controlling and satisfied feeling, then they repeat the same kind of conscious thoughts over and over again. What becomes their subconscious thoughts in their memory. When used often the synapses becomes stronger, as soon a situation is there, as a trigger, then automatically the own taught behavior is expressed impulsively.
People like to be controlling by Ego. When they have problems to control sometimes things in their lives, then they start to control small things. What makes them feel in control and what comforts them.
How more they repeat this behavior how stronger OCD becomes.
The same happens with fears, how more negative and fearful thoughts you formulate and repeat over and over again, you stimulate the synapses that holds these subconscious thoughts and shall at all kind of slightest triggers, light up in your conscious Awareness. And impulsively you feel instantly afraid. When someone constantly formulates fearful thoughts it can become an OCD. And instantly people can become afraid.
OCD is when someone is experiencing a trigger, the choice of formulating a positive or negative choice has disappeared. This person is not able to formulate conscious thoughts by free will anymore and solely act on subconscious thoughts impulsively. OCD is also found regular in anxious people, still not admitted by many. Anxious people who are not severely OCD can still make a choice by free will in certain situations to do something consciously differently, that opposes the need to follow fearful subconscious thoughts impulsively. All fears are still a form of OCD. If someone has OCD then they act solely impulsively every time a trigger activates negative and fearful behavior.
If you know how your mind works, you are able to dissolve OCD.
You have to let the person to make choices. To show the negative thoughts leading to negative consequences, and the positive thoughts leading to positive consequences. To let them be able to control their own thoughts again. This has to be step by step followed through.
For example.
When someone is afraid for spiders.
Then this person has formulated negative conscious thoughts in the past, and repeated them over and over again, with a bad experience that one spider bit them for example, or with watching, seeing, reading, thinking the same negative thoughts when seeing a spider.
Negative thoughts can be that this person is afraid to get hurt, to get bitten, or just say I think they are creepy, I don’t like them, I want to stay out of their way, I don’t want to see spiders, etc. These are all negative thoughts having negative emotions as a consequence.
What needs to be done is to restore Reality. To understand the differences of a spider and a Man. To understand as a Man you are in control in this case, you can keep your distance and nothing happens. To understand every life is valuable and important to have balance in life, etc.
Then this person have to make a list of positive thoughts about why they do not have to be afraid of spiders. When this person repeats this list of positive thoughts with positive and loving emotions over and over again, just by reading them. They create synapses in their mind that connects fearless thoughts with their believe system. And they learn not to be afraid anymore. It is as simple as written here. What you are doing here is to reprogram your synapses in your brain to connect other thoughts to your belief system you prefer in life. In previous answers I have given many examples in details how to work this out. For example look at many previous answers about dissolving fear for bugs, driving, depression, etc.
Fearful people or OCD people have to understand Not to think and formulate conscious anxious thoughts anymore. Otherwise they are just stimulating the synapses that holds these negative fearful subconscious thoughts and light up in their Conscious Awareness. When they do not use these negative fearful thoughts any more, they forget their fears. And even the synapses that connect these negative fearful subconscious thoughts to the trigger, to see a spider for example, shall disconnect.
This works the same to erase all negative emotions from your life. Imagine that if you don’t experience Any negative emotions or upset, bad or sad feeling in your life, then it gives room to be Happy in life. And I can tell you this true happiness from within feels GREAT and WONDERFUL.
Start with small steps to erase One negative emotion from your life and to learn to control your conscious thoughts with free will again. After a while you shall learn you can overrule all subconscious thoughts that let you impulsively think or act negatively, with choosing conscious thoughts you prefer in life. In Every situation in life you have a CHOICE, to formulate thoughts you prefer. Learn to become Master of your thoughts and feelings again. What is all based on very ancient Wisdom of right human relations. Believe it or not, still it is true. Only by trying and doing the effort you shall see it works, it works and it works.
Life is all about thoughts and choices.
Choose well.

Thomas Francisco Pelgero",GAD
657,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
658,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
659,"Anneka's story begins with the death of her sister. She went from a happy, cheerful child to one who couldn't bear for any objects in her room to be touched.
If she could just make everything in her room 'perfect', then she'd feel some sense of control and the feelings of anxiety wouldn't overwhelm her. She would stand at her door, unable to leave because it didn't feel “right”. Why she was scared of stepping out, Anneka could not put into words.
Schoolwork became a way of transferring her obsessive behaviour into something that appeared “acceptable.” She made never-ending lists, fearing that if she didn't constantly check them, then something terrible would happen.
She dreaded losing a list to the point where once, she retrieved one from a public bin. The fear of not having the list overclouded the idea of putting her hands in a dirty bin.
For Anneka, it was never about germs or cleanliness. The lists blocked out her intrusive thoughts and stopped her falling into the abyss she feared so deeply.
By the age of 34, after medication and counselling, Anneka started to unpack the memories of her sister's death. By allowing herself to feel, her intrusive thoughts quietened.[1]
One of the common misconceptions of this illness, is that people believe it's all about germs and organisation.
In reality, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder that is fueled by irrational and unwanted thoughts and images which repeatedly enter the mind (obsessions).
This obsession causes intense feelings of anxiety and distress.
To minimize the anxiety, the person will be driven to engage in common rituals (compulsion). This may include repeatedly checking locks on doors, repeating certain words or phrases and so forth.
Doing so temporarily allows the person to cope with their intense fear, however, the obsession and anxiety soon returns and the cycle begins again.
Common obsessions include: the fear of deliberately or mistakingly harming yourself and others, fear of contamination by disease or infection, and a need for orderliness.
Common compulsions include: checking, counting, ordering, hoarding, cleaning, asking for reassurance, avoiding places that may trigger the obsessive thoughts.
Most people with OCD know that their compulsions are irrational, however, they continue to act upon them “just in case”.[2]
The biggest difference between the pop culture idea of OCD and OCD as it truly is, is that the individual truly believes that without engaging in the rituals, something terrible is looming.
The illness can seriously dehabilitate a person's daily functioning. To throw phrases such as “I have a little OCD” or “I'm so OCD” is not only insensitive, but ignorant and offensive.

660,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD

662,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before.

663,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
664,"OCD is not just about cleanliness as everybody thinks it to be. It is about obsessive thinking or simply obsession of something, it can be anything, possible or impossible!
Let me tell you how it feels like. Its like somebody has tied down to a chair and then they hit you continuously but you can't do anything about it. The hits start to get harder and harder and the pain only increases. It happens because if you are obsessed with things that are not even possible how can you even find a solution to your obsession, all you feel is the frustration and anxiety hurting you within.
It's not a mental disorder, it's just a state of mind that makes you behave differently. It is really painful when others don't understand it and call it abnormality. Let me tell you it might be an abnormality but not everybody is strong enough to survive it.",GAD
665,"Possibly. Other theories are Loss. The loss can be anything from, Post Partum depression, like a still birth or pregnancy termination, a loss of a loved one, a loss of their homeland, culture, or language for immigrants. Another is PTSD, post traumatic stress disorder, another theory is that addictive personalities are inherited genetically and that OCD, OCPD, SUPER OCD, and TYPE O OCD, are manifestitation of addictions, like food addiction, substance abuse or internet addiction, sex addiction, or love or relationship addiction. A common link is abandonment issues, such as parental. There is a social scientist who wrote an essay about early child chronic dehydration possibly contributing to development of teen OCD. Anxiety is one way of also describing insecurity. Many mental health issues overlap and it is common to treat 3 diagnosises at the same time. Issues like body dysmorphia, low self esteem, abuse survivors, anorexia, bulemia, binge eating, and eating disorders are co-related. Obsessions with counting or rituals are called Method.
OCD is rarely just 1 symptom. It is not like, a person has all white hangers in their closet, they must be ocd. OCD is more like, everything should be all white; the sheets, the walls, the curtains, the floor, the window pane, the book covers, the laundry basket, the appliances, the car. It is a alittle manic or taken to an extreme with or without the depressive cycle. The impulse factor, is a little like Add or Adhd. The compulsive nature is when the person decides to make everything all white, and then goes out and shops for white materials, including a white stuffed animal and flower vase, collecting items (hoarding). What is considered pure, and calming, and a trigger could be somone influential like a yoga teacher encouraging the students to wear all white in class, so, the student begins collecting white dresses, white 3 ring binders, even white out pens. White is the symbol of heaven and angels, of great design, representing good. Obsessions may have a spiritual or religious trigger or affinity. This is purity culture, (virginal white wedding dress).
It is possible to distinguish that a person has a generalized or social anxiety disorder, and OCD, and Add, and chronic depression. It is not necessary to have a depression diagnosis. So, in conclusion, I would say that anxiety is a co-relation to OCD, not the cause. The cause is not yet understood, but neuro-scientists are looking at the frontal lobe, hypothalamus, how the chemical reaction that fires off thought procesees, gets stuck in a misfire. It has something to do with an emotional attachment to objects, like the pain receptors are engaged when an item is discarded in the trash, this is why hoarding is a symptom of OCD. It is not necessarily always anxiety or avoidance of anxiety, but an avoidance of pain. We can choose what we associate pain or pleasure with. Part of adolescence is discering “I like this, I don’t like that” and the brain is still forming well into the mid 20s. Anxiety is the natural state of animals in the animal kingdom. It helps prey escape predators. The presence of anxiety in the human experience is a survival skill. So I would say no, anxiety is not the root cause of OCD, because many people have anxiety and no ocd. They are more likely existing silmutaneously. Each individual manifests their rituals uniquely. Not everyone with OCD, counts their steps, not all are concerned with purity, cleanliness or hygiene as seen in squalor. OCD might be a symptom of overcompensation for self soothing, like in an affection starved upbringing, lack of a loving home invironment in childhood, adolescent or young adult domestic violence or psychological abuse, or low or damaged self esteem and worth. A person with OCD, may not be trying to avoid anxiety, as much as proving they are good at something. Perfectionism is lacking the assurance that it is “good enough”, you are “good enough” you tried “hard enough” and they never experience the “enough is enough”. This can be conditioned or re-conditioned.
I have had OCD since teenage, but did not realize it until my late 20’s and did not seek treament until late 30’s. When channeled into healthy activities like education, OCD and hyper-fixation can be an asset, allowing drive, focus, goal setting and achievment. When channeled innapropriately, it can be disfunctional behavior.
With about 500 view already, I want to wish everyone good luck, continue researching and thank you for upvoting my answer.

666,"That’s a good question. OCD is an anxiety disorder. The sufferer experiences anxiety from the compulsive thoughts that he or she is experiencing. Generalized anxiety disorder, on the other hand, can cause obsessive thoughts. I would guess that whichever symptom shows itself ugly head first is the disorder someone has. Did it begin with anxiety or did it start with obsessions?",GAD
667,"To understand how our mind works.. And body
For example ..Just now, if we listen the news that, war has begain with Pakistan..
BP.... BP will fluctuate automatically.. But in different different levels... Like if some mother whose child is deployed on border.. And a normal women..
Bp level will be difference.. But why?
Because our subconscious mind like memories system know the consequences of war..
Same.. Your consciousness depends on the memories... Every disorder related to subconscious mind.. Because it has duty to serve thoughts like a restaurant..
Your all cells of body depends on the consciousness feeling..
..evert disorders is fault in machine..
Already spirituality has been declared that..
You are “cheetana“and your body is “jadh “
Jadh means no feelings in this body.. Only your consciousness has power to feel..
So, Don't worry and try to understand spiritual language..lot of material is available.
Last.. Research your own subconscious mind because it has unique because no other memories will match with it..

668,"While sociopathy, or antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), is characterized by a lack of empathy and disregard for others' feelings, individuals with this disorder can still experience comorbid conditions, including anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are distinct conditions involving excessive worry, fear, or apprehension. It's not uncommon for someone with ASPD to have heightened levels of stress and anxiety, possibly related to the consequences of their actions or social interactions. Each case is unique, and a comprehensive evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment. For a more detailed exploration of this topic, you can find insightful discussions on my Quora profile.",GAD
669,"A great question,
Unlike a psychopath who are typically calm and collected under pressure (due to ‘resilience to chaos’ theory), Sociopaths are far more vulnerable to anxiety.
As a result of being vulnerable to anxiety, sociopaths do not do as well in highly stressful environments. Sociopaths are significantly more prone to episodic angry outbursts and abusive language, whereas a psychopath can and often will manipulate without seeming like a threat.",GAD

674,"A former professor of mine put it this way: just because the fool is nuts does not mean they don’t feel bad or have anxiety or suffer stress. In other words the patient might pull the wings off of flies and hurt small animals with glee, but that does not mean they don’t feel the same distress normal folks do regarding mood and cognitive processing of stress or anxiety about pending events. The difference here is not the emotion, bur rather the depth of the feeling and the consequences to how those feelings are processed. You or I feel sadness about some event, the death of a relative for example, the sociopath feels this too, just not anywhere near the same level of feeling or have lingering or recurring feelings of loss like a normal person would. You could say that whatever feelings they have would be channeled into a very narrow band or area of evaluation. They will likely as not remember the event, uncle Fred died in June, but really not care one way or the other, after the event. As human beings we all feel things, the difference in a normal mind or an abnormal mind is one of degree.",GAD
675,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.

678,"Can they? Yeah. Does it happen often? Definitely not.
Psychopathy is a spectrum, even down to the areas that are damaged.
There have been studies (I don’t have the effort to look for them, maybe someone can link it) that show high-functioning psychopaths are at risk for social anxiety. Although maybe not to the point of a disorder, it’s still significant and goes against what a lot of people on here are spewing.
Keep in mind, psychopathy is like a lot of other mental disorders. It’s not as if you have generalized anxiety or you don’t, or you have depression or you don’t. It’s traits that mount up, and when you have enough, you get a diagnosis. Psychopathy is no different. Also, I’m of the opinion that there are A LOT more traits of psychopathy than what most checklists actually account for.
That being said, maybe a psychopath does have a phobia or a mild anxiety problem, but has almost every other trait such as manipulativeness, fearless dominance (despite their anxiety trigger), lack of empathy, impulsiveness, blunted affect, etc. It’s not about whether or not a psychopath has every single trait, it’s the amount of traits and to what intensity. Just because they have one or two things that go against it here and there doesn’t mean they aren’t psychopathic.
So you know what? Yeah, I think it can happen. It would just be rare.",GAD

Ok, that was his public personality. When alone, not only would he sit for hours just rocking in a chair watching old movies over and over again, he feared doing anything new......anything. He was anxious going to a new suburb, a new restaurant or to try a new way of doing something. It seems like he was afraid to be seen and judged as not being able to do something well so it was safer for him not to do anything at all. Avoidance of anything new appeared to be his way of coping. I guess the only two things he did really well in life was being charming....and being anxious. Breaking up with him was one of the most difficult things I ever had to do...Sociopaths certainly have a way of staying in your heart.",GAD
680,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
681,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
682,"YES, but it can be not visible even to the psychopath him/herself. Poor connectivity from amygdala to prefrontal cortex does that. Psychopath can be anxious and just interpret it as a weird feeling inside. Only if he/she would describe this feeling ot someone and someone would call it anxiety they will know.
Psychopaths can have internal panic attacks but they won’t be really scared of dying during this because they know it’s nonsense. They would interpret it as a really uncomfortable feeling inside body, their blood pressure might go up, temperature of the body can change very fast like in panic attacks. But due to this poor connectivity from amygdala to prefrontal cortex they don’t interpret it as a life threatening situation rather something to wait out.
Most psychopaths will tell you they do not have any anxiety but it is not true, everyone has. They just don’t recognize it as such. Psychopath’s amygdala is not completely turned off. It is just not connected to mental processing.
So it is like psychopath can have an anxiety disorder but it would look different than in non-psychopath.",GAD
683,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

689,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

Most of the time I just want to sleep, take it away to get away from everything that’s going on in my mind. I constantly worry. I’ve got so much going on in my mind and in my life that is so negative right now. I cannot eat and I cannot sleep. I lost my older son in a horrific car accident and that began. The worst anxiety. And for his little brother as well. He is fighting opiate addiction to get away from the memories that haunt him. Some days I am just afraid to leave the house. I don’t wash my hair or bathe. It takes too much energy. I have been on every antidepressant in the world. I have had 45 TMS therapies on my brain. And I still cannot escape the pain that is in my head that transfers into my heart… I don’t love, my husband. My husband has turned violent. Since the loss of my older son who was shining star. I have sought much therapy, but he will not go. He has gotten very physically violent as of late, and I will not going to details. I but I am afraid of him. Anyhow, that’s my anxiety.

691,"I can answer for GAD for sure. When it's bad, it's hell.
I can't pretend to speak for anyone else who suffers from GAD, but for me, I develop an inability to concentrate on anything for any length of time.
My sleep patterns become restless and disturbed. I have unsettling dreams that I'm either arguing with someone, or that I'm being chased.
My breathing becomes very shallow.
I tend to be very on-edge to the point that I get over-sensitive to pretty much everything.
Sometimes I second guess everything that I do.
Occasionally I will lapse into people pleasing as well. I often feel like I have to be something I'm not.
The worrst part of it for me is feeling slighted too easily. It can change my mood in an instant.
I also cannot seem to calm myself down, even when I try.
Sometimes I nap just to pass the anxious feelings. It tends mostly to be a short-term fix.

694,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD

Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
696,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
697,"Have your doctor do a trial of Ativan, an intermediate benzodiazepine, and see how that works. I’ve taken benzos all my life and I don’t have the putative symptom of mild cognitive impairment, have no tolerance so I never raised the dose and, frankly, I don’t plan on withdrawing for those whose business is founded on finding as any people as possible taking anything to fill beds. Two of my doctors, one Chairman of Psychiatry at a name brand university, uses Ativan as I do.",GAD
698,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

699,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
700,"Wow, that's nasty. My wife went through a period with ‘that', as in, I am and I don't know why!
May I suggest a drug free path to freedom.
1st, take as much time, days, weeks, months, to compile a lot of the things, events, travel, crowds, meeting new people etc that make you feel anxious. If possible during this time, mark events when the anxiety happens.
Over time, look at your notes, consider carefully what and how these feelings surfaced.
Now, 1, if it's not important, as in, it's not life threatening, money issues, do some simple analysis, Why do I let this become a problem.
Can I let it go and accept these events are part of everyday life and just accept, shit happens.
2, if these events are really freaking you out, is it possible to have a family member or very close friend come with you sometimes. Later, talk about these feelings (2heads are better than 1), to see if you can devise a plan on what you can do when you start to feel the first ‘rising' inside of you.
Hopefully, when you can see that you are not in harms way, the world is suddenly going to end, the severity of these attacks will decrease from an 11 out of 10 to an 8 or 7. This is the beginning of the victory. Be prepared to try new things, then it should drop to a 4 or 5. At this point you should congratulate yourself on your improvement, you can do this when it's an 8 too, just so you can see for yourself the ‘issue' is decreasing.
The truth is, it might never become a zero, a little bit of anxiety can be your friend. You treat it like a gentle reminder or warning to take inventory of your surroundings. Depending on your analysis, you stay and enjoy the moment, or make plans to go home safely.
This world we are living in is highly stressed, we can learn to live between the highs and lows. Not must, too much pressure then. Take your time, take notes, share 1 or 2 events, not all at once, as you overcome 1 and 2 then 3, your confidence should grow enabling you to take the challenge with 4, 5 ,6 etc.
I really hope this helps you formulate a plan to kick this ‘thing' to the kerb and become the conqueror you were created to be.
I have a simple statement I use a lot, “I don't have problems, I only have solutions “.
I apply this with work, repairs, finances, and self reflection and counseling. If a ‘problem' is too hard for me, my solution is to phone a friend and ask for help. You'll be amazed at how awesome true friends can be. All the best, Andy",GAD
701,"Ssri doesn't always do it.
The drug for anxiety is diazepam and much of the same group of benzodiazepines.
The problem with this group of sedating medicines is that they can be addictive and very difficult to come off.because of this many doctors will not prescribe them or at least prescribe for only a short period.
Last I heard is if you take maximum dosage for 2 months about 50% of people will begin signs of addiction.
Personally I was prescribed diazepam for 20 years,it was hugely beneficial ,I never felt any addictive symptoms at all and I have stopped taking for 1 year as my panic attacks have gone,so it seems just as some people are addictive types and will get hooked on anything, some,like myself, have always found it very difficult to get addicted to anything.
There are alternatives such as ssri,beta blockers such as propranolol, and other sedative type drugs which are not addictive but generally they are not as powerful for anxiety as diazapam.
Klaus",GAD
702,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
703,"Yes.
This is not specific to any particular anxiety label, either—everything from OCD to GAD to SAD to PTSD to agoraphobia to anxiety associated with autism-spectrum labels can result in a doctor pitching antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotics can be proposed as the primary or singular drug to use, but oftentimes patients are told to use a cocktail including multiple kinds of drugs (for instance antidepressants + antipsychotics, sometimes with a hypnotic sedative like zolpidem for insomnia, an anxiolytic like buspirone for daytime use, or a benzodiazepine for severe difficulties or panic attacks).
Antipsychotics will not always be saved for after other more relevant drugs and non-drug approaches have been explored, to the detriment of patients. It is up to us to be aware and to hold our professionals accountable. There is far more prescribing allowed than there is benefit from that prescribing. This means that we have to be responsible for seeking the right information and support to make the best decisions possible, and to engage with the most fitting professionals we are able to. Penning a prescription does not automatically make that prescription good, valid, or helpful.
Generally, these kinds of prescriptions are not based on rigorous systematic study and are not approved by regulatory agencies like the FDA. But, most psychiatric prescribing is ‘off-label’. This is particularly true due to the doses and durations of use commonly proposed. Since antipsychotics are chemical lobotomies, it is conceivable that they could diminish one’s experience of or reaction to anxiety, especially as an emergency, short-term measure. However, they also include the risk of new or worsening anxiety and panic, in a variety of forms. Continued use is more like to cause more anxiety problems than successfully and tactically defuse any present ones.
Antipsychotics are usually most appropriate as emergency measures, for instance trying to short out a dangerous and traumatizing drug trip, bringing down an intractable ‘mania’ or ‘psychosis’ across a day or three, and so forth. They are not really an appropriate or blanket-useful approach for most instances of ongoing anxiety, and their risks far outpace the risks of chronic anxiety. That does not mean no patients could ever find antipsychotics helpful, but extreme caution is warranted and there is almost assuredly a better way forward in the long run.
Since “anxiety” is a pretty expansive concept and is based on subjective psychosocial ideas rather than diagnosed through scientific medical measures, there is also the concern of addressing underlying issues instead of simply trying to stop the brain from working correctly (or at all). There are many different potential causes of anxiety, some medical in origin and others psychological in nature. Antipsychotics are not a diagnostic tool in this respect, and the roots of chronic anxiety can not uncommonly be essential to constructively responding to it. That antipsychotics have serious neuropsychological risks means they are sometimes an explicitly counterproductive effort in uncovering and addressing the roots of chronic anxiety.
So, yes, antipsychotics are sometimes prescribed for anxiety. Whether or not they are a good idea or actually ‘treat’ anxiety is another matter. Individual responses will vary, as well prescriber attitudes and institutional paradigms. Being aware of the risks, potential benefits, and available alternatives, and pushing for informed consent and professional accountability are all part of responsible, self-effective consideration of drug use. Antipsychotics are prescribed for any variety of things, so the real question is whether a specific instance of use is to be considered ethical, appropriate, and more helpful than harmful.",GAD
704,"It is extremely unusual to find a psychiatrist who does not pull out a prescription pad on the first meeting. It is also unusual these days for a psychiatrist to be involved with therapy. Since we have a 5% recovery rate in the USA, how psychiatrists believe someone would do better clearly is not a metric. The field of Psychiatry is stuck in a repeating loop of making claims and not having the evidence to prove them. Psychiatrists who pass on prescribing are few and far between, and it isn’t about anyone’s best interest but their own. If they actually really cared about what is best for people, they would learn about how to safely withdraw from the drugs they prescribe. It’s not happening.",GAD
705,"It can be.
Pregabalin, or Lyrica, was developed as an anti-epileptic drug (AED), but like most AEDS, it has been repurposed. Pregabalin is a gabapentinoid and is most commonly prescribed for nerve pain, but is increasingly used off-label for anxiety. Like other seizure medications, Lyrica works by stabilizing cell membranes. This prevents cascade events, i.e. a few misfirings turning into a major misfiring.
What’s special about Lyrica for anxiety is that, by stabilizing these membranes, it also extinguishes excitatory neurochemicals. There is also some evidence it inhibits the formation of excitatory neurons in general, as these can multiply over time in the setting of chronic anxiety.
The biggest drawback is that it can take a few weeks for pregabalin to kick in.
As far as side effects, most commonly Lyrica causes sedation, clumsiness, vision issues, confusion, difficulty speaking, weight gain, headache, memory loss.
Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine, and works on certain receptors that open cell channels to inhibitory neurochemicals. It is cross-reactive with alcohol. It works fast for anxiety, but wears off fast, leading to a peak-and-valley effect. This can lead to greater and greater use and eventually addiction.
Side effect profile of Xanax is similar to pregabalin. Xanax is a schedule IV controlled substance. Lyrica id a schedule V.",GAD
706,"There are several including Paroxetine. Escitalopram and Venlafaxine - but….. rule number 1. DO NOT take advice about stuff like this from some random stranger on the internet. There are MANY factors that have to be considered here.
These include, who diagnosed this condition and why? Is it correct or is it perhaps a manifestation of a physical problem - thyroid perhaps?
So, my strongest advice is - don’t take my advice! Go and see your GP (primary care Dr)- they will know what to do (hopefully) if you have doubts, or if they recommend it - go and see a specialist.
Hope you feel better soon - anxiety is horrible!",GAD
707,"Yeah, somebody can be. and I was for a very long time. what you need to do is go over your doctor's head. are you in school? I kind of think you might be, but if you are, get ahold of the counselors, and tell them that you need to see a psychiatrist and ask them if they could arrange it, or refer you to someone who will deal with you medically, mentally. also you can tell your doctor that if he doesn't want to work with you on a mental level, you can always get another doctor. he won't like it but maybe just that minor threat will get him to look into getting you some medical mental help. sometimes you have got to play hard with these people. they forget that they're not god's, that they're just like everybody else. sometimes they need a kick in the nuts to remind them that they're human. I've had this problem it happened that I fired that doctor, and got another one who saw me as a human being before being a patient. it was nice. I wish you good luck on finding the right therapist and psychiatrist for yourself, and yeah you need both. okay, I'm out of here. bye-bye.",GAD
708,Tramadol is a weak opiate. It has nothing to do with generalized anxiety disorder as tramadol is scripted for moderate to severe pain. Yes you could get a script for tramadol though with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. There is no law in place that says those who have anxiety cannot take opiates medications. Is is safe? Depends. Opiates are addictive even mild ones like tramadol. You would need to speak to your doctor about the effectiveness and safety profile of this drug for your unique situation. If you have a history of substance abuse than tramadol prolly would not be used. It is not a medication however scripted for anxiety but for pain management. Good luck.,GAD
709,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common mental health condition characterized by excessive worry and anxiety that persists for extended periods and interferes with daily life. Fortunately, several effective medication classes can help manage GAD symptoms. Here's an overview of some commonly prescribed medications:
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):
First-line treatment: SSRIs are often the first-line medication class for GAD due to their effectiveness and tolerability.
How they work: SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood regulation. By enhancing serotonin activity, they can alleviate anxiety symptoms like excessive worry, tension, and restlessness.
Examples: Common SSRIs used for GAD include escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil).
Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):
Alternative option: SNRIs can be an alternative for those who don't respond well to SSRIs.
Mechanism of action: SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs but additionally affect norepinephrine, another brain chemical influencing mood and alertness.
Examples: Venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are SNRIs commonly prescribed for GAD.
Buspirone:
Unique mechanism: Buspirone works differently from SSRIs and SNRIs. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to influence specific neurotransmitters involved in anxiety.
Slower onset: Unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, buspirone typically takes several weeks to show its full effects.
Advantage: Buspirone is less likely to cause some common side effects associated with SSRIs and SNRIs, such as sexual dysfunction and sedation.
Benzodiazepines:
Short-term relief: Benzodiazepines are fast-acting medications that provide short-term relief from anxiety symptoms.
Use with caution: Due to their potential for dependence and addiction, benzodiazepines are typically only prescribed for short-term use or in specific situations like managing severe anxiety during a panic attack.
Examples: Alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are some commonly used benzodiazepines.
Choosing the Right Medication:
The best medication for GAD depends on individual factors like:
Severity of symptoms
Medical history
Response to previous medications
Potential side effects
It's important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for your individual needs.
They can also monitor for side effects and adjust the medication regimen as needed.
Additional Considerations:
Non-medication approaches: Therapy, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle changes can be helpful alongside medication in managing GAD.
Combination therapy: In some cases, a combination of medication classes or medication with therapy might be necessary for optimal symptom control.
By working with a healthcare professional and exploring different treatment options, you can find an effective approach to manage GAD symptoms and improve your quality of life.",GAD
710,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
711,"Unfortunately Doctors/psychiatrists will always try to manipulate people to not take the medication that works usually on the grounds of “they are addictive”. I personally have been prescribed Valium and it works wonders on my GAD allowing me to work efficiently (I’m a child protection practitioner very anxious work), calm me down quick when my bipolar has episodes and helping me to do everyday tasks, sadly for me recently my doctor told me he can no longer prescribe to me. I am not going to doctor shop and beg for something that works and be stigmatised and stereotyped as a pill seeker, it’s more badder for my mental health and self esteem which is an absolute shame on the Health System and The GP’s who are refusing to help! Sometimes I wish a doctor has gone through half the shit I been through just so they can feel the racing thoughts, twitching muscles, over thinking, separation anxiety, bipolar and unwanted thoughts of past trauma including prison and loosing my family/ex partner. If a doctor refuses to give medication that works effectively for a patient and then that patient turns to alcohol or other illegal drugs for relief and then something bad happens to them, doctors should be held accountable for refusing to “cause no harm” by not prescribing benzodiazepines or other meds that work for a patient.

712,"Drugs offer temporary relief but also come with a variety of side effects E.G. Irritability and short fuse which can make us feel even more anxiety as they are not our usual emotions. So the circles of anxiety continue and before you know it you are physically addicted and dependent upon some little pills
In my humble opinion, the best way to treat anxiety is deep intensive therapy
Find a therapist and buckle up. It is going to be a long, difficult journey. Best taken though as it is the most effective treatment for most mental illnesses
Scared of it? Imagine spending your whole life scared of the unknown. Completely in the knowledge that if you had tackled it starting tomorrow a lifetime of anxiety could have been halved

713,"Medication is very effective short term. But it's not a solution. There are two main reasons.
Tolerance. Now, if medication stayed effective indefinitely, it would be a miracle. But that's not how our brains work. Our brains are wired to keep a state of homestasis. This just means our brains adapt their structure and chemistry to maintain a state of balance. When you take any drug, it either increases or decreases certain chemicals in the brain. Your brain notices this, and will change to return to its normal state. Anxiety meds increase seretonin or GABA. When this happens, your receptors will downregulate. This means it has a built in function to reduce the natural procuction of these chemicals when it detects there is a surplus. This is what tolerance is. The more you take the drug, the less of the natural chemicals your brain will make. You will have to take larger and larger doses because of this.
Pumping your brain with chemicals does not change the neural structures associated with anxiety. It just dampens them. So you are not fixing the problem. Psychotherapy on the other hand, slowly rewires your brain to avoid these neural structures, and actually fixes the problem.
I suggest therapy. And you may have to try a few therapists until you find one that works for you. I also suggest looking into mindfulness meditation. This method is extremely powerful. There are numerous studies showing that 8 weeks of mindfulness practice reduces the connections between your prefrontal cortex and your amygdala, which is like your brains alarm bell. It also changes many other structures in your brain. Psychotherapy can do the same, mindfulness is something you can do on your own time.
If you are keen on taking meds, then only use them as emergency measures.",GAD
714,"You probably aren't going to like my answer.
I learnt to tolerate feeling anxious. I feel like this should be suggested to people with intractable anxiety and it seldom if ever is.
I used to compulsively eat to deal and I actually got treatment for that, very successfully and haven't engage with that in nearly two decades. Unfortunately I never found anything that worked as well. CBT cured the dodgy thinking that contributes to GAD but I'm genetically hard-wired to be anxious. I'm actually on betablockers with little to no effect at high doses. Breathing exercises can sometimes take the edge off but nothing settles me more than briefly. I realised that I would have to come to terms with feeling like this forever. I tried distress tolerance exercises and they helped me manage.",GAD

716,"I’ve had GAD for ~20 years. Ditto for major depressive disorder. (The two interact in a complex way, but basically having an episode of one makes the other worse.)
I’ve found the following to be very helpful in managing my GAD:
Regular aerobic exercise (bicycling, brisk walking, running, swimming, aerobics exercises). What works best for me is exercising 3–4 times/week at an intensity that stops my brain and body from worrying/brooding for at least 30 minutes.
Doing something that I enjoy that requires focus. For me, that means playing a musical instrument, woodworking or working at the computer.
In addition to other meds for depression, I take 1–3 mg of Klonopin daily. I’ve been on that dosage for 10 years under the care of the same psychiatrist I’ve seen for ~15 years. I see him at least every 3 months with more frequent visits if I’m going through a particularly rough patch. In my opinion and based on my own experience, “don’t take benzodiazepines” is a decision that must be made by you and your doctor. If you can manage your anxiety without medication, great. If not, there are many alternatives to benzodiazepines that could work well for you. Personally, I haven’t found anything else that is effective.

718,"I cannot confidently say that I have overcome panic attacks fully. I developed panic while I was on treatment for depression and anxiety way back in the late seventies. At that point the treatment for depression and for that matter any mental disorder was very limited . Only in the nineties it improved after the discovery of SSRIs and new benzodiazepines starting with alprazolam. SSRIs and benzodiazepines helped me to overcome depression and panic attacks for a long time . In 2017 ,the toll of taking these medications began to show up due to weight gain and water retention to mention two of the prominent side effects. I was forced to go off the medications cold turkey resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms. These included panic attacks which forced me to go to the emergency department of a hospital near my house 3 times. It took 4 years or so to get over the ill effects of stopping these medications. Thought I am feeling near normal with no signs of depression or severe anxiety, there are occasional panic attacks which I go through. I keep myself in good general health so as to get over occasional panics.Homeopathy and a balanced life help me to remain fit and cope .",GAD
719,"Therapy. I had been suffering from GAD, SAD and depression for 2 years before I finally decided to seek help. Don’t do what I did. Even if you think therapy won’t work for you, please try it if you can. If one therapist doesn’t work, just keep trying, because not every therapist might work for you. I started off with psychodynamic psychotherapy and that helped me SO much. That therapy might not work for everyone, but there are several types you can try. If you find one kind isn’t workung, you can just tell your therapist and they’ll help figure out one that will benefit you the most. Even though it’s been 10 months since therapy started, I’m still working on my GAD and SAD, but my GAD has gotten MUCH better. It’s a slow process, but you can do it.
Also, I take Zoloft and it’s working. Although it’s still hard to do a lot of things, I definitely see an improvement. I also take propranolol for my chronic headaches, but it also helps increase the effect of the Zoloft. The Zoloft is mainly for my SAD, but they could probably work for GAD. If anyone in your family has GAD and they take medication, you should probably ask if you can go on the one they take because there’s a higher chance it’ll work well for you. For example, Zoloft helped my mom the most, so I was put on that.
Good luck xo. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask",GAD
720,"Lessons I Have Learned From My 20 Year Struggle With Fear And Anxiety
By: Stan Popovich
I dealt with fear and anxiety for over 20 years and here are some lessons I learned during my mental health struggles.
1. Listen To The Professionals And Not Your Friends: Your friends may mean well, but when it comes down to it, the professionals know your situation more than anyone. They know what you are going through and are trained to deal with your situation. Consult with a counselor when you have questions about your mental health issues.
2. Distance Yourself From People Who Give You A Hard Time: Distance yourself from those people who won’t make an effort to help understand what you are going through. You need to surround yourself with positive and supportive people. I felt better when I avoided those people who would constantly argue with me regarding my anxieties and stresses.
3. Focus On The Facts of Your Situation And Not Your Thoughts: When people are depressed they rely on their fearful and negative thoughts. Your fearful thoughts are exaggerated and are not based on reality. When you are depressed, focus on the facts of your current situation and not on what you think.
4. Learn From Your Experiences: In every anxiety-related situation I experienced, I learned what worked, what did not work, and what I needed to improve on as I managed my fears and anxieties. For example, you have a lot of anxiety and you decide to take a walk to help you feel better. The next time you feel anxious you can remind yourself that you got through it the last time by taking a walk.
5. You Can’t Predict The Future Regardless What Your Thoughts May Tell You: No one can predict the future with one hundred percent certainty. Even if the thing that you are afraid of does happen, there are circumstances and factors that you can’t predict which can be used to your advantage. For instance, you miss the deadline for a project at work. Suddenly, your boss comes to your office and tells you that the deadline is extended and that he forgot to tell you the day before. This unknown factor changes everything.
6. Things Change Over Time: Regardless of your current situation, things do not stay the same. You may feel very bad today, but it won’t last forever. Everything changes over time and this includes your current mental health issues.",GAD
721,"I have 3 intertwining anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, and Derealization/Depersonalization), so my symptoms often overlap and feed into each other. Also, physical and psychological symptoms often go together, but I will try to narrow them down to be more specific. These are some of my psychological symptoms:
Overthinking (worrying about the past/future). I can’t stop thinking about things that worry me and I will over-analyze an event, moment, or comment to the point of even having an anxiety attack.
“Fortune-telling” (worrying about the future). This symptom is what happens when you start imagining all the bad things that could happen and goes along with overthinking. It usually happens before I go out or meet with friends. At my worst, my thinking could get so negative that I find myself not going places because of this.
Feeling extremely irritable, angry, restless. I can usually tell when my anxiety is acting up when I feel uncomfortable for “no reason”, (but the reason is that I have anxiety). When I’m like this, it’s easier for me to get overwhelmed and I often have the need to withdraw from socializing.
Feeling “on edge” or jumpy, getting scared easily.
“Automatic thinking”. Most of the psychological symptoms stem from “automatic thoughts,” which are negative thoughts or assumptions that quickly pop-up in your mind and leave you with a severe feeling of dread or make you apprehensive to do things.
Lack of concentration. Not being able to understand people/things around you because you have so much going on in your mind.
These are a few that I could think of. Although it’s really hard to deal with all aspects of anxiety, what makes it harder is when the physical symptoms accompany the psychological ones. So you don’t only think certain things, but you feel certain ways when you think them.
I hope this helped.",GAD
722,"I recently discovered it. I knew I had anxiety, I was seeing a psychiatrist for it and taking medicine. It wasn't until I had a spinal fusion I got a proper diagnosis/diagnoses. I took a pain medicine called oxycodone because the nurse gave it to me and I'm 14 and i didn't know there were side affects. My blood pressure dropped dangerously low I couldn't stay awake for more than 30ish minutes. My cortisol levels dropped and I was out. When I woke up they handled my blood pressure levels but never took me off the oxycodone. I started to have 6 to 8 panic attacks a day in the hospital even though I wasn't in ICU. 2 days later I started hallucinating. I saw very gory and messed disgusting things that no one would ever imagine. It lasted for 7 days. I got PTSD from this. When I went to a different psychiatrist she said my anxiety progressed to GAD or even maybe a little worse, along with the PTSD that I'll have forever. I use CBT therapy to help me with every.",GAD
723,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
724,"I do. To get over it 1)I do extreme amounts of exercise (~4 hours a day)-that is basketball, cycling, paced walking and gym.2) being able to breathe deep is also helpful- aside from sports which develop respiratory muscles and have beneficial neurological effects I take aceterine during winter(otc nasal decongestant). It took me years to develop current exceptional physical stamina- during sports I barely feel breathless compared to other people(in contrast I often feel chest tightness when resting). Recently I have started taking symethicone (otc anti- bloating agent), for me it reduces the symptoms of GAD.Psychotherapy like CBT or exposure tolerance enhancement are rubish and are not backed by credible scientific evidence and in my experience trying to implement them lead to exactly the opposite effects- increased anxiety. Relaxation techniques are inferior to exercise. I doubt I will ever completely get over it, however currently it’s tolerable",GAD
725,"I literally wrong a blog on this!
Fck fear: My extraordinary life with GAD
It is actually fitting that fear should be the topic of my first blog post as it is also my first real core memory. I was 10, and the incident had nothing to do with me or my family. A neighbour on the street had a heart attack. To be honest I don’t even remember if he died or not. I wasn’t close to him. In fact, I can’t even remember his name. What I do remember is the ambulance, the lights, the uncertainty, the chaos, the fear; the fucking fear.
There was already uncertainty and chaos in my life at the time although, I had no idea. As a young child, you assume your way of life is the norm. Regardless, that one night tripped something in me and I swear I have been afraid every damn day since. Crazy thing is that I have often been described as, wait for it, fearless! Which goes to show you that you can in fact make a whole identity out of faking it until you make it even when some days you are hanging on by a thread.
Don’t worry, this is not a poor me story. Instead, mine is an ongoing story; a saga you might say (dramatic much?) of hardcore, bad ass, grit and perseverance. I made a choice long ago to lead with joy and not with fear. A choice I hope you make today.
In the vein of full disclosure, I must confess that I currently owe my sanity and therefore my success to, in no certain order: 30 years of therapy, medication, CBT, meditation, exercise, a right mental attitude, never giving in or giving up and last but not least my vast and dark sense of humour. And yes, I am in fact a fully functioning and successful member of society. I know, not all heros wear capes. Do not get overly excited though because I have, on more than one occasion worn shoes that did not match.
My road trip with anxiety so far has been long and winding. The first time I was taken to “see someone” as my mother called it I was around 18. Both my paternal grandparents and my father had died by this time and my family was in the midst of the chaos and trauma of dealing with my maternal grandmother battling dementia. I was also deep into an eating disorder that started with my brilliant idea to control my anxiety with binge eating a tray of diet muffins and then coming up with the even more brilliant idea (truly thought I was a genius) of just throwing them up to not gain weight. Just this one time, I thought. Spoiler alert, seven years later I ended up in a treatment program at Toronto General Hospital. Turns out that idea has already been tried and had a name, bulimia. Also, it was in fact not brilliant at all.
Funny enough fear itself is not actually a problem. Fear is a natural response to perceived danger: Fear is a universal emotion that humans and animals experience when they sense a potential threat. It is a primal response that helps us survive by activating the fight-or-flight response You need this if being chased by a bear. You don’t need your fight or flight response activated when you are going to the mall, or taking an elevator (me). Side note: why does everyone use the bear example? I am now wondering how many people are chased by bears annually. Is this common? Should I be worried?
There are many types of anxiety disorders and many ways anxiety can present itself. Let’s deep dive in the abyss shall we?
Types of anxiety disorders:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about everyday events and activities, accompanied by physical symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: This involves sudden, unexpected attacks of intense fear and physical symptoms, such as a racing heart , chest pain, and sweating.
Social Anxiety Disorder (also called Social Phobia): This is a fear of being judged or scrutinized by others in social situations, leading to avoidance of social situations and impairment in daily functioning.
Specific Phobias: These are intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations, such as flying, heights, or spiders.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): This involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts or impulses (obsessions) that cause anxiety, and repetitive behaviours or mental acts (compulsions) performed to alleviate the anxiety.
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): This can occur after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, and involves symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance, and hyperarousal.
Anxiety disorders can vary in severity and can co-occur with other mental health conditions, such as depression or substance abuse. It’s also possible to experience symptoms of more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, fun right? I have 1,2, a sprinkle of 4 and a dash of 5. I aim to excel.
So, After almost 40 years in a long term committed relationship with anxiety (my longest relationship; no I am not proud) I want to share some things I know for sure.
Fear is a bully. Fear wants to keep you small; wants you to back down. Like all bullies, when you stand up, the fear will stand down. You may have to ride through life with anxiety but you don’t have to let it be in the driver’s seat. It stays in the back seat; hell, the trunk. I promise you this decision will change your response to anxiety and make way for a much bigger life.
You will not die, lose control, or go crazy, although it sure as hell feels like it. My anxiety at its worst got me thinking about who would raise my kids, because I was surely heading to a mental hospital. Through therapy (and many dr visits) I came to understand that while the symptoms I was experiencing (dizzy, heart racing, hyperventilating, out of body, all the good stuff) were debilitating they were not life threatening. I long ago made peace with being very uncomfortable in the short term and so can you. I always make it through.
You can and should do it anyway. Whatever “it”is. High on the list of things I fear has always been flying. In fact for most of my life, I went no where. When everyone was backpacking Europe in their teens and early twenties, I was doing nothing. Now I fly a minimum of once a year. Do I love it? Nope, I do not. Do I do it? Yes, yes I do. Am I scared? Yes, yes I am. I decided that I was not going to sit back and one day be that old bitch who never saw any place other than buffalo (no clue why I use this example, I am in Toronto so Buffalo is close. No offence to Buffalo). My point is, I decided (again it is a decision) to live and not to let fear decide where I could do. Now I do what any normal person does. I take drugs, get on with my left foot, because my ridiculous brain tells me that is safer (OCD much?) and off I go. No clue where I came up with the left foot thing but I would knock over an old lady if I got on wrong and had to redo it. I didn’t say I was cured, I said I was functioning.
You are not broken and more importantly, you are not alone. Not by a long shot. Anxiety effects approx. 12% of the Canadian population, or about 3.7 million people. Many people do not seek help because they are ashamed, so these numbers are absolutely underreported. Don’t even get me started on our kids. Is there a kid that is not anxious after the pandemic? They should consider an open bar for parents in the waiting room or therapists offices.I have always been an open book about my struggles with anxiety in the hopes that people will know that they are not alone, damaged, or broken. Every-time I do, someone always gratefully tells me that they too have had their own struggles and I see and feel the relief they feel knowing they are not alone.
Do not be ashamed to consider medication for your anxiety. It has saved my life, period. Medications for anxiety like SSRIs are very safe and effective. You are not weaker or lesser than needing them. Trust me there is no special medal for suffering more because you are not medicated and if there is I don’t want it. I do not get the people that want to suffer. It has be the same group of people that give birth unmedicated on purpose.
I want to leave you with this fact. No one gets out of here alive. Fantastic choice for an anxiety blog right? Well, the truth is there there is no better catalyst for chance than this one unique absolute truth we all share. And while your mortality may scare you, it may also free you to know you can not hide, shelter, isolate or avoid your way into nothing “bad” ever happening. No matter what kind of bubble you put yourself in, we all get one life and it is a time limited offer. It is my hope for you that you ride yours until the wheels come off.",GAD
726,"Simple answer to your question is: it is hell, living with GAD.
When I was a kid, I had no idea what it was, I just assumed everybody woke up feeling sick with worry that just around the corner, doom waited for you. It was my normal, but I hated it, I hated it so much, and would have done anything to get rid of it. It tarnishes everything, you see, even the most positive and happy occasions in your life can be tainted by the thought it'll all come crashing down around your ears at any moment.
I was finally diagnosed with GAD in my twenties. It made so much sense, and gave me something to aim for: I had a name for what was wrong with me, and therefore a framework with which to understand myself and my engagement with the world. But no pills worked, no therapy worked. I stayed anxious. There was no rhyme or reason to it; it strikes seemingly at random, and when it does it is so potent, so powerful, it is impossible to ignore.
In my thirties I had a breakdown, and I really had to face up to myself to get through it. Part of that was trying to accept the anxiety as a part of myself, and to show that part some compassion. I used to talk to it when it came on. I’d say, ‘Listen, I get it. I know you're scared. I know you're just trying to take control.’ I'm sorry to say this didn't work, either.
Then in my forties I got diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum. This was yet another difficult revelation, but one which I have tried to use pragmatically. I know now that there IS rhyme and reason to my anxiety after all. At times when it seems to come on randomly, there's actually very good reason for it: sensory overload (which I'd never even recognised before) being the primary culprit. Understanding this, that anxiety is co-morbid with autism, has made an enormous difference to me. I am using mindfulness now, to address these issues, and so far it is working out really well. I don't know how much you know about meditation, but to take as the object of my contemplation, how anxiety feels inside my body (the nausea, tension, scrambling thoughts etc.) really helps to diminish the feelings themselves.
How? you may wonder. I believe it is that once I'm watching the anxiety, there is a realisation deep-down that I AM NOT the anxiety. That is such a crucial understanding: your anxiety is just one thought in your mind amongst many, just one feeling in your body amongst many. You could choose to concentrate on a thousand other thoughts or feelings. This disconnect, this knowing YOU are NOT your worries, I have found the single best treatment for anxiety (and, I may say, other mental health conditions, as well). I really cannot recommend mindfulness strongly enough. Give it a try. It's not easy, and takes practice, but it really does pay dividend. Good luck to you.",GAD
727,"I was diagnosed with panic disorder. However, my panic attack stopped years ago. They were debilitating. I also had mild case of agoraphobia. But I have GAD now, constant worrying, just there are not panic attacks anymore:
I overthink. I think of many things and I am prone to think about past and future, and I am usually very sad when I think of past, and for future-well I try to control it in terms that I try to avoid some possible obstacles and perceived dangers (even if danger is barely possible)
I think of death too much, and what is going on after death
I am restless and fidgety and I cant sit on one spot, and I need to take a walk often.
I have health concerns, even that I am most likely healthy.
I feel sorrow, especially for the past
I lost interest in things I used to enjoy (this also can be depression and not simply GAD)
I dont have will to socialize as I used to have.
I am constantly worried about many things.
I can become angry and I have problem controlling it.
I have a feeling of impending doom, like all will vanish or be destroyed, and that nothing positive is going to happen.
Lack of concentration.
Feeling of lump in the throat, difficulty swallowing sometimes.
Difficulty breathing (especially shortness of breathe).
Stomach problems and pain.
I used to have palpitations, but not anymore.",GAD
728,"However, like other anxiety disorders, GAD is highly treatable. Some of the most effective treatments include psychotherapy, medication, and making lifestyle changes
Long-term strategies for coping with anxiety:
• Identify and learn to manage your triggers.
• Adopt cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
• Do a daily or routine meditation.
• Keep a journal.
• Socialize.
• Try supplements or change your diet.
• Keep your body and mind healthy. Ask your doctor about medications.
• You can overcome chronic anxiety.
You can get your life back. It's not easy for most people, and it probably won't be easy for you either, but the good news is that it can be done. You can visit the therapist and can seek the therapies and get your life on track with their advice. For instance you can visit Drivekraft once, I have worked their and the therapist out there are really sympathetic and they will surely help you out in dealing this.",GAD
729,"Yes! Be in control of those emotions. Mindful meditation, simple breathing techniques, lots of practice. Medication makes it easier.If you struggle with addiction issues, practice will help. Dealing with this this takes commitment. You can control those thoughts that cause you to stress. Study mindfulness and breathing. Practice makes it easier. You be the boss. The harder you work the easier it gets.",GAD
730,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
731,"I am a chemical engineer suffering from anxiety probably since early childhood. I can think of several ways how the condition negatively affected me - development of my personality, my relationships (being completely shy and withdrawn around girls) and my physical health. And I can witness that meds (SSRI in my case) significantly improved quality of my life. Please give it a try.
As for the brain chemistry alteration, please note that these meds don’t “add” chemicals to your brain but prevent your brain from decomposing the serotonin.
Don’t go into the “hard” antidepressants that kick in immediately. As far as I understand it these should be used only in severe cases (e.g. tendency to commit suicide).
And if you decide to start with SSRI (with guidance of your psychiatrist of course) give them time of at least one month to make effect. In the beginning your condition might get worse and sleep disorders are almost sure thing. But the positive effects outweigh the negative.
Which are the positive effects?
Better mood, feeling more “myself”, better recognition of automatic negative thoughts and ability to work with them, better social interaction, improved ability to focus at work.",GAD
732,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,
Katie❤️⭐️",GAD
733,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
734,"I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 19 too. I’m now 24. First I was to congratulate you for being brave enough to seek help and get a diagnosis. You have already won half the battle, you know what is going on and you’ll soon have the tools to handle it. This is a big accomplishment, recognize that.
In my personal experience I went to therapy and was on low doses of medication. I’m still in therapy and still on low doses of Zoloft. I have tried so many medications and doses until I found the one that works for me. It takes time. If medication is the route you’re going, be patient and talk openly with your psychiatrist about side effects you’re experiencing.
Talk therapy is also a great help. It will give you the tools to get through bouts of anxiety and help you live a completely normal life. Also, any good psychiatrists worth their salt will make sure you’re in talk therapy along with medication. Or you can do talk therapy alone. Plenty of people find it helpful by itself.
The bottom line here is, you need to find a support system and having a mental health professional in your corner backing you up will only help you. Sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right one and get a good fit but it’s worth it.
As far as socially, get a good support system of friends. Maybe tell one or two what’s going on but you don’t have to do that if you’re not comfortable. Nobody is entitled to know if you don’t want to tell them. But don’t underestimate your friends, I’m sure they’ll want to be there for you.
Sending positive thoughts. You got this!",GAD
735,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
736,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
737,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
738,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
739,"Yes, panic attacks can be very much a part of general anxiety disorder.
If you were to consider the symptoms of anxiety as an orchestra, the panic attack would be the crescendo at the finale.
That being said, you can suffer from GAD and not have panic attacks or you can suffer panic attacks (panic disorder) and not have GAD. Complicated creatures, aren’t we?
Another dilemma that GAD sufferers have is that once they have experienced the hell of a panic attack, they tend to panic about becoming panicked. Which only creates more panic.
A horrible vicious cycle that must be broken by conquering your fears of anxiety symptoms and then digging deep to find the root cause of your anxiety as a whole.",GAD
740,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
741,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

742,"Not everyone with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experiences anxiety attacks or panic attacks. GAD is characterized by chronic and excessive worry and anxiety about a wide range of everyday concerns. While it can cause significant distress and interfere with daily life, it doesn't always manifest as sudden and intense anxiety attacks. Panic attacks, on the other hand, are characterized by intense fear and physical symptoms like rapid heart rate, sweating, and trembling, and they can occur independently of GAD. However, some individuals with GAD may also experience panic attacks. The presence and frequency of anxiety attacks can vary from person to person. For more detailed information on GAD and anxiety-related topics, please visit and follow my Quora profile.",GAD
743,"Indeed they can. Anything can set off a generally anxious person to go into a full-blown panic attack.
These types of individuals have overactive and hypersensitive nervous systems. Their stress-tolerance may be lower than the average person's.
Someone is diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when they feel anxious for no reason. Sure, certain circumstances in their life might not be ideal. They might have financial issues, maybe they're in some credit card debt, and find it hard to pay it off. Maybe they are having relationship issues. Maybe they have a general malaise and apathy towards life — more of an existential coming to terms with meaning and impermanence type of thing.
Whatever the case, yes → they may develop triggers that form panic attacks and then the panic attacks make everything feel threatening.
It’s learning how to control perspective and shift into states of mindfulness that really help with panic attacks → unlike hyperventilating, deep breathing helps tremendously quell all symptoms of panic and anxiety by shifting the body into a parasympathetic (rest and digest) state.
Other things that help reset and or strengthen the resilience of the nervous system towards stress, thereby combating generalized anxiety and the resulting panic attacks are things such as hormetic stressors, adaptogens, and mindfulness practices:
Cold showers
Saunas
Physical activity
Mushrooms
Meditation
Grounding
Breathwork
Yoga, Qi Gong, Tai-Chi
Journaling
Green Tea
Ginseng
It should go without saying but know your health risks and consult a health professional before trying a bunch of new supplements and practices. Do your own research and weigh out the options yourself.",GAD
744,"I have 3 intertwining anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, and Derealization/Depersonalization), so my symptoms often overlap and feed into each other. Also, physical and psychological symptoms often go together, but I will try to narrow them down to be more specific. These are some of my psychological symptoms:
Overthinking (worrying about the past/future). I can’t stop thinking about things that worry me and I will over-analyze an event, moment, or comment to the point of even having an anxiety attack.
“Fortune-telling” (worrying about the future). This symptom is what happens when you start imagining all the bad things that could happen and goes along with overthinking. It usually happens before I go out or meet with friends. At my worst, my thinking could get so negative that I find myself not going places because of this.
Feeling extremely irritable, angry, restless. I can usually tell when my anxiety is acting up when I feel uncomfortable for “no reason”, (but the reason is that I have anxiety). When I’m like this, it’s easier for me to get overwhelmed and I often have the need to withdraw from socializing.
Feeling “on edge” or jumpy, getting scared easily.
“Automatic thinking”. Most of the psychological symptoms stem from “automatic thoughts,” which are negative thoughts or assumptions that quickly pop-up in your mind and leave you with a severe feeling of dread or make you apprehensive to do things.
Lack of concentration. Not being able to understand people/things around you because you have so much going on in your mind.
These are a few that I could think of. Although it’s really hard to deal with all aspects of anxiety, what makes it harder is when the physical symptoms accompany the psychological ones. So you don’t only think certain things, but you feel certain ways when you think them.
I hope this helped.",GAD
745,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
746,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
747,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
748,Generalized anxiety disorder is a very broad illness and encompasses a huge range of symptoms. Anxiety attacks are not necessary for a GAD diagnosis,GAD
749,"To have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder is to live everyday with constant anxiety. What makes it ""Generalized"" is that the subject or ""cause"" of the anxiety is arbitrary. It is normal and natural to experience anxiety about certain things in our lives. Public Speaking and job interviews tend to top the lists of most common causes of normal anxiety. When you are anxious about those things, your mind is on overdrive working through all the possible scenarios and embarrassments, and you may also experience physical discomfort like dry-mouth, excessive sweating, a pit in your stomach, and nausea, among other things. It is considered to be a pretty uncomfortable experience, to say the least. However, most people only think about anxiety within the context of the thing causing it (that speech, for example), or that time your loved-one was in that car crash and you didn't know anything about their condition until you got to the hospital (and what a nightmare that whole experience was). You might have even experienced, or heard anecdotally, that the ""not-knowing"" was the worst part, because at least once you had some details you could begin the process of coping with the reality. Well, that terrible state of ""not-knowing"" is the essence of anxiety. It can be sort of an odd thing to think about being in that state without the understandable triggering event, but what an anxiety disorder is, in very simple terms, is when that trigger is MUCH more sensitive than normal, and in many cases can get stuck in the ""on"" position. Those feelings are caused by chemical reactions in your body and brain as a response to your brain's processing of a certain situation in the physical world. In that way, you can see that there is a ""pairing"" aspect between a state that your brain perceives and the feelings then associated with that perception. In a generalized anxiety disorder, there is an unnaturally elevated presence of the feelings (could be thought of maybe like a leaky ""seal"") and so the brain will then have to pair up things on it's own because it doesn't know what else to do (it is programmed to have those feelings associated with some undesirable ""state""). So with GAD it is the pervasive presence of the feelings of anxiety due to a chemical imbalance that is the cause of paired thinking. Let's go back to that car crash example. Someone you don't know calls you and says ""are you the brother/sister/wife/husband/parent of X? they have been in a high speed auto collision and are being airlifted to Hospital Y, that's all I can tell you."" and then they hang up. At this moment, whatever else is happening in your life has stopped immediately, your mind cranks up into over drive an the only thing you can think about is this person. ""will they be okay? What if they die? What will I tell their friends? What will I do? No, no, don't think like that, they'll be okay. What if they never walk again? Do I need to take anything with me to the hospital?"" Try if you will, to really imagine this, what it would feel like, if you haven't had the misfortune of actually experiencing it. The rest of the world seems to go on like normal, but everything else is secondary to this over-arching ""thing"". Few people, I would think, would take the time to dress their hair up or ponder over which pair of shoes to wear with their outfit... Additionally, let's say, on the way to the hospital your pal calls you to ask for some advice on an up-coming meeting. I'd venture it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to re-focus your attention towards the details of your pal's queries while you're currently wondering whether or not your loved one is going to die. I wanted to really focus on this example because one of the most crippling aspects of an anxiety disorder is that it literally hijacks your brain into spending a lot of time and energy worrying about things that make no sense to worry about. I was diagnosed with a severe generalized anxiety disorder 12 years ago. I've been taking medication for about 10 years now so I'm getting better (and yes it takes 10 years or longer, depending on the severity and type, to ""heal"" from an anxiety disorder because it is such a complex thing, the brain). You can tell now that I have been able to successfully compartmentalize the disorder from myself and my identity. However, even after I was able to rationally defeat certain worries in my head, I was still not able to stop the intrusive worries. To someone who has not been diagnosed or is unaware of their condition, GAD is basically a living nightmare where you are always overwhelmed with the fear of some great unknown... and your mind will generate subjects to attach the worry to. For example, I used to worry constantly that I was suicidal, or could be suicidal... that makes no sense... someone who is actually suicidal is considering ending their own life, but I was only worried about how bad it would be to consider ending my own life, while at no point actually considering it. See? My brain concocted an artificial paradox that couldn't be empirically tested beyond constantly inwardly harassing myself (as opposed to, say, worrying that my pants would be unzipped at tomorrow's meeting and everyone would see it... as I could take measures to ensure that my pants were zipped, by zipping them...) My example is relatively severe, some people can just be excessively worried about things that are normal to worry about, but to such an extent that it interferes with normal life activities. However, things like ""excessive"" and ""normal"" can get fuzzy in many instances and mental disorders can intermix with each other with varying symptoms being more or less prominent depending upon the individual. Which is why all disorders exist on a spectrum and can be complicated to diagnose. This was just the little abridged version of my personal experience (very abridged), but maybe, hopefully, someone somewhere could be able to benefit from my take on it.",GAD

There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.

Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)

757,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
758,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
759,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD

Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
765,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
766,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

769,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else.

770,"It can be.
Pregabalin, or Lyrica, was developed as an anti-epileptic drug (AED), but like most AEDS, it has been repurposed. Pregabalin is a gabapentinoid and is most commonly prescribed for nerve pain, but is increasingly used off-label for anxiety. Like other seizure medications, Lyrica works by stabilizing cell membranes. This prevents cascade events, i.e. a few misfirings turning into a major misfiring.
What’s special about Lyrica for anxiety is that, by stabilizing these membranes, it also extinguishes excitatory neurochemicals. There is also some evidence it inhibits the formation of excitatory neurons in general, as these can multiply over time in the setting of chronic anxiety.
The biggest drawback is that it can take a few weeks for pregabalin to kick in.
As far as side effects, most commonly Lyrica causes sedation, clumsiness, vision issues, confusion, difficulty speaking, weight gain, headache, memory loss.
Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine, and works on certain receptors that open cell channels to inhibitory neurochemicals. It is cross-reactive with alcohol. It works fast for anxiety, but wears off fast, leading to a peak-and-valley effect. This can lead to greater and greater use and eventually addiction.

775,"Short answer: it can be, yes, especially eating disorders (technically classified as anxiety disorders) and other compulsive behaviors.
Long answer: we don’t know exactly how TPM works, but we can elucidate at least 5 mechanisms of action: 1) enhancement of GABA effects; 2) antagonism at kainate-subtype glutamate receptors; 3) inhibition of sodium and calcium channels similarly to other anticonvulsants; 4) inhibition of carbonic anhydrase subtypes II & IV; and 5) blocks calcium influx into cells.
If you are familiar with the kindling model of untreated mood disorder worsening over time, it is based on the kindling model of epilepsy. We know that some anticonvulsants are effective mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproate, lithium)—so while there is mixed evidence for TPM as a treatment for bipolarity, it has quite favorable outcomes with people losing weight/controlling food portions (esp. in combo with phentermine or perhaps with Vyvanse for Binge Eating Disorder) and even reduces drinking/alcohol cravings in some patients (might be related to the common adverse effect of taste perversion—some can no longer stand carbonated beverages—as well as its pharmacodynamic effects). This points to a special niche for TPM in treating compulsive disorders (dermatillomania, trichotillomania, alcoholism, gambling & sex addictions) which can bump up against and overlap with anxiety disorders.
More often than not, however, TPM will be an augmenting agent rather than a monotherapy for indications bridging anxiety and compulsivity and addiction, such as OCD, pathological skin picking, and even refractory PTSD.

776,"hi! Just by doing a quick search I think since xanax and lorazepam are so similar, i would stick with the lorazepam. Lorazepam works for longer durations than xanax, so you might need to take more medication if you switched to xanax. Not familiar with the pricing, but I’m assuming this might also save you some money. Xanax is better for those who need anxiety treatment to work faster, probably better for those in a crisis, since the half-life of xanax is shorter than lorazepam. The side effects also seem to be similar. too have generalized anxiety, I wish you luck on your medication journey. (if you can find a non-addictive treatment, I would definately try and switch your approach. I understand lorazepam probably works great for you, but from someone who has struggled with substance abuse and a substance abuse disorder, maybe you could try an even more controlled space for addictive substances like ketmine therapy or psychadelic therapy.

Whereas, a social anxiety is when you get nervous when interacting with other people. Or get worrying too much about how you’re going to have a good conversation and what if the conversation turns to be bad.

782,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
783,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

785,"I don’t know when I ever felt “normal” anxiety, but from what I’ve observed, it’s more reasonable than GAD-anxiety. A lot more.
The metaphor I like using (and I’ve seen around a lot) is that it’s like missing a step while climbing the stairs. Normal anxiety is panicking for a few seconds before you catch yourself; once your foot is on the next step, you sigh in relief and continue on, likely forgetting about it ten minutes later.
Generalized anxiety is when there is no other step and it feels like you’re falling forever, and it takes a while before you find your footing again as your brain is yelling at you that there will never be another step and you doomed yourself.
Normal anxiety is when you worry about sensible things; an exam, job interview, asking someone you like out for the very first time, things like that.
GAD is also worrying about those things, but everything is upped to 11,000. It’s slightly different for each person, but from my experience, I get nervous about tests and social groups the moment I learn about them. Everyday things that everyone goes through, I panic inside about all the ways it can go wrong. I can’t even play guessing games with my friends because I panic over nothing. The simple English class homework assignment that’s a page long? Takes me over two hours to do because I think there’s a trick question somewhere and “it can’t be this easy”.
The worst and most drastic difference between the two? Normal anxiety is temporary. GAD causes those who have it to often be on edge; I’d have trouble even staying outside on a windy, peaceful day because - true story - I’ll jump after hearing a leaf land on concrete. That wouldn’t register in a person’s mind if they didn’t have anxiety, besides maybe observing the leaf fall.
Another way to think of it is GAD is having a mental sonar radar always on. When there’s a sudden noise or something unexpected happens, there’s a red flashing “ping” on the radar. Everything in your body goes to Red Alert, and will continue until the source/reason of the suddenness is discovered and deemed harmless, then to wait until the nerves calm down from being frazzled.
I hope that all helps!",GAD

787,"Well a specific phobia is easily the most different of the three. It's a pervasive sense of fear, anxiety, or disgust causing someone to NEED to avoid such a thing. For instance, I have trypophobia (fear of many holes, tiny holes) and claustrophobia (fear of dark enclosed spaces.)
My trypophobia makes me have to look away, feel incredibly nauseous, and almost start crying just by seeing them. It feels as though my skin is crawling. It isn't always just holes, it can be circles such as this beach texture in Pokemon Legends Arceus that makes me feel icky or the way wasps nests look. I love Steven Universe, but seeing the kindergartens (which are where gems break out through the earth in a mass production thing so lots of holes) made me want to cry and I could NOT look at the screen. My claustrophobia is a bit different as it's mostly enclosed or tiny spaces. I feel trapped and terrified and may have a panic attack. I get that way in cars as well. The dark does make it worse (I also have a fear of the dark), but just the thought makes me feel like I could die. It's intense fear/anxiety/disgust at these specific things. It can be so genuinely upsetting for people. For instance, I think it was some trashy show, but they brought in a woman who was afraid of olives and promised her they wouldn't show her then then they brought out olives anyway. The reason she feared them was because it reminded her of the eyes of a corpse of a family member. It was a traumatic experience and a trigger for her. Phobias can be brought about by traumatic experiences which can be small or minor things as well. I can't say for sure where my phobias come from, but they can't be helped either way. So phobias typically have a specific trigger.
While GAD and SAD can have triggers, they are typically scenarios, different, etc. Phobias always have the same trigger with it being something that resembles the phobia (for instance, it may not be the exact same object or thing, but it's similar enough that the brain thinks of it like that.) While GAD and SAD have far more broad triggers. For instance, my GAD is triggered by a lot of scenarios involving people as well as my trauma. It plays into how I react and worsens my PDs. But it isn't strictly social scenarios, it can be anything where it feels as though something will go wrong.
SAD is socially based entirely. Thoughts of social interactions, being out in public, feeling constantly scrutinized, wondering if people are watching or looking at you, wondering if you sound normal just to name a few. My GAD affects me socially, but it is GENERALIZED anxiety in which case it is far more broad. GAD for others can include something bad happening to people, feeling like it's the end of the world over small things, fearing an actual end of the world, anxiety constantly where it's just like everything feels like it'll go wrong and pervasive thoughts of “what if this happens or that happens?” SAD is pervasive anxiety in social situations, whether it's online, over text, in person, just being in public, on call, etc. Both disorders are pervasive and regular experienced, aka chronic even when they aren't actively in a scenario. While phobias are often not constant and only when a person is around the specific thing they fear or something that resembles it. For instance, someone fearing wide open spaces may encounter it more so they'll be more triggered than something like a phobia of cats where they can often be avoided. Or olives can typically be avoided and while thunderstorms may not always be avoidable since weather is unpredictable so if you're in a place with such weather patterns, you can't exactly avoid it.",GAD
788,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
789,"Firstly, I’m obviously not offering a diagnosis, but to answer the general question about the difference between those two diagnoses, GAD is characterized by a clinical level of anxiety across a variety of situations. Social Anxiety is just as it sounds, anxiety arising from social situations.
As a practical example, social anxiety would be a person who has mostly tolerable anxiety in most situations, but clinical levels of anxiety when meeting new people, giving a speech, or engaging in social situations as opposed to a person who has anxiety toward tests, fear of accidents happening, fear of animals, as well as fear of social situations. If you’re concerned about the differentiating features, the DSM-V will sort out the criteria for the diagnoses specifically.
However, as it sounds like you’re trying to diagnose yourself, I would instead recommend speaking with a mental health professional about the fears and anxiety you might be experiencing, as that is more likely to lead you to relief than assigning yourself a diagnosis and category.",GAD
790,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
791,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
792,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
793,"Generalized is that many things can cause anxiety in you. School, work, relationships, family, new plans. It means you worry in general about the outcomes of things.
Social anxiety is directly linked to people. I have it. Going to school is not a fun thing when you are socially anxious. Probably one had had bad past experiences with people.",GAD
794,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
795,General anxiety disorder doesn't necessarily have to do with social settings (being at a party or school) while social anxiety disorder does,GAD
796,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
797,"Social anxiety is when you get extremely anxious in social settings like a grocery store for example. And general anxiety is getting anxious about just about anything in an excessive manner. A lot of people nowadays will claim they have social anxiety or general anxiety, but dont know the true meanings behind them. I suffer from social anxiety. Its a real pain in the ass. All the time people will say they have it too like its contagious or something, but its not. Theres a difference between the two, like i had mentioned before, and in order to fully understand these types of anxieties, speak to someone who has social anxiety and someone who has general anxiety, and who actually went to a certified doctor for these things.",GAD
798,"To have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder is to live everyday with constant anxiety. What makes it ""Generalized"" is that the subject or ""cause"" of the anxiety is arbitrary. It is normal and natural to experience anxiety about certain things in our lives. Public Speaking and job interviews tend to top the lists of most common causes of normal anxiety. When you are anxious about those things, your mind is on overdrive working through all the possible scenarios and embarrassments, and you may also experience physical discomfort like dry-mouth, excessive sweating, a pit in your stomach, and nausea, among other things. It is considered to be a pretty uncomfortable experience, to say the least. However, most people only think about anxiety within the context of the thing causing it (that speech, for example), or that time your loved-one was in that car crash and you didn't know anything about their condition until you got to the hospital (and what a nightmare that whole experience was). You might have even experienced, or heard anecdotally, that the ""not-knowing"" was the worst part, because at least once you had some details you could begin the process of coping with the reality. Well, that terrible state of ""not-knowing"" is the essence of anxiety. It can be sort of an odd thing to think about being in that state without the understandable triggering event, but what an anxiety disorder is, in very simple terms, is when that trigger is MUCH more sensitive than normal, and in many cases can get stuck in the ""on"" position. Those feelings are caused by chemical reactions in your body and brain as a response to your brain's processing of a certain situation in the physical world. In that way, you can see that there is a ""pairing"" aspect between a state that your brain perceives and the feelings then associated with that perception. In a generalized anxiety disorder, there is an unnaturally elevated presence of the feelings (could be thought of maybe like a leaky ""seal"") and so the brain will then have to pair up things on it's own because it doesn't know what else to do (it is programmed to have those feelings associated with some undesirable ""state""). So with GAD it is the pervasive presence of the feelings of anxiety due to a chemical imbalance that is the cause of paired thinking. Let's go back to that car crash example. Someone you don't know calls you and says ""are you the brother/sister/wife/husband/parent of X? they have been in a high speed auto collision and are being airlifted to Hospital Y, that's all I can tell you."" and then they hang up. At this moment, whatever else is happening in your life has stopped immediately, your mind cranks up into over drive an the only thing you can think about is this person. ""will they be okay? What if they die? What will I tell their friends? What will I do? No, no, don't think like that, they'll be okay. What if they never walk again? Do I need to take anything with me to the hospital?"" Try if you will, to really imagine this, what it would feel like, if you haven't had the misfortune of actually experiencing it. The rest of the world seems to go on like normal, but everything else is secondary to this over-arching ""thing"". Few people, I would think, would take the time to dress their hair up or ponder over which pair of shoes to wear with their outfit... Additionally, let's say, on the way to the hospital your pal calls you to ask for some advice on an up-coming meeting. I'd venture it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to re-focus your attention towards the details of your pal's queries while you're currently wondering whether or not your loved one is going to die. I wanted to really focus on this example because one of the most crippling aspects of an anxiety disorder is that it literally hijacks your brain into spending a lot of time and energy worrying about things that make no sense to worry about. I was diagnosed with a severe generalized anxiety disorder 12 years ago. I've been taking medication for about 10 years now so I'm getting better (and yes it takes 10 years or longer, depending on the severity and type, to ""heal"" from an anxiety disorder because it is such a complex thing, the brain). You can tell now that I have been able to successfully compartmentalize the disorder from myself and my identity. However, even after I was able to rationally defeat certain worries in my head, I was still not able to stop the intrusive worries. To someone who has not been diagnosed or is unaware of their condition, GAD is basically a living nightmare where you are always overwhelmed with the fear of some great unknown... and your mind will generate subjects to attach the worry to. For example, I used to worry constantly that I was suicidal, or could be suicidal... that makes no sense... someone who is actually suicidal is considering ending their own life, but I was only worried about how bad it would be to consider ending my own life, while at no point actually considering it. See? My brain concocted an artificial paradox that couldn't be empirically tested beyond constantly inwardly harassing myself (as opposed to, say, worrying that my pants would be unzipped at tomorrow's meeting and everyone would see it... as I could take measures to ensure that my pants were zipped, by zipping them...) My example is relatively severe, some people can just be excessively worried about things that are normal to worry about, but to such an extent that it interferes with normal life activities. However, things like ""excessive"" and ""normal"" can get fuzzy in many instances and mental disorders can intermix with each other with varying symptoms being more or less prominent depending upon the individual. Which is why all disorders exist on a spectrum and can be complicated to diagnose. This was just the little abridged version of my personal experience (very abridged), but maybe, hopefully, someone somewhere could be able to benefit from my take on it.",GAD
799,"My first job was as a part-time cashier at a supermarket.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but I have sensory issues. Of all the emotional pain I’ve dealt with in my life, nothing compares to sensory overload. You know the trash compactor scene in Star Wars? It’s like that. Like the walls are closing in on all sides, mountains of things building up and slowly crushing you to death. There is no way to escape and no one to hear you scream, nothing to do but wait for the inevitable moment when the pain reaches unbearable levels and the last breath is squeezed from your lungs.
I was barely functioning. I couldn’t count out change, I couldn’t follow instructions with more than one step, I couldn’t understand what people were saying when they were talking to me. I couldn’t think.
But I was supposed to learn quickly, follow instructions immediately, remember a plethora of unwritten rules, make small talk with customers, answer questions, comply with customer requests, memorize produce codes, count out change.
And smile as I did it.
For up to six hours.
(Also, side note, if your cashier doesn’t smile and say hello when you enter the line, that doesn’t mean she is “rude and disrespectful” or “not trying” or “ungrateful for her job” or “exactly what’s wrong with this generation”. Maybe she’s suffering from severe anxiety and she literally cannot speak. Please, please, have compassion.)
The only way I could do anything was complete mental shutdown. I was told at least once per shift that I looked depressed, I had difficulty putting things into bags because I was so dissociated I couldn’t tell where my hands were, but I could breathe. I could barely understand English, but I could breathe.
I thought that was normal.
I tried to tell my parents about it, but I assumed they knew the emotions I felt. To them, it was just complaining. So I was treated to talks from parents and grandparents about all the worst jobs they’d ever had and how they were so much worse than mine and life is work, and what I learned was that life is a contest to see who can bear the most pain without letting anyone see, and if I spent a single moment not in agony that meant I was lazy.
I learned not to confide in anyone. I learned to suppress my anxiety attacks until I was alone. I did not learn how to calm down from them.
The anxiety attacks began to happen outside of work more and more often. I was constantly on the verge of one. The twenty-four hours surrounding each shift were complete panic.
To cope, I completely blocked my job out of my mind. I shut off any and all thoughts related to it, I told myself that the hours I worked didn’t exist. I was left with only a vague feeling of dread.
After over a year, I quit my job.
But the dread persisted. It wasn’t connected to my job anymore—I had so completely removed my job from my mind that I no longer remembered it as the source of my anxiety. Life was the reason I was anxious. Life was hard, life was pain, if it was bearable I was doing it wrong.
My problems were invalid because my life was too good. I didn’t have problems, I was just lazy and weak.
I suspect these are not the “life lessons” my parents had wanted me to learn when they drove me to the supermarket to fill out an application.
Though that was a while ago, I still have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I’m still constantly anxious, worried that I’m doing something wrong or something bad is going to happen. The dread is a self-fulfilling prophecy: something bad happens eventually, and then it’s proven right. My triggers have changed, but the anxiety is still there.
I’m working on it. I understand now where the dread came from, and I understand that the negative messages I received from the adults in my life were due to miscommunication on my part.
I feel a bit embarrassed that my anxiety disorder was caused by such a minor thing as a part-time job… but I know that’s my anxiety talking, and my mental health issues are still valid. It has taken me a long time to accept that.",GAD

Hello
We have a natural defence mechanism called fight or flight against any external threat to us. Whenever we are triggered of a threat, a hormone called Cortisol is released in our blood. This increases our heart beat rate and blood pressure. Diverts blood from our internal organs to our brain and limbs. Dialets our pupils and makes us more alert. In other words makes us battle ready to face the external threat.
If we are triggered frequently and then there is no external threat to react with. The Cortisol level in our blood becomes high and it gives us stress or anxiety, which after some time after the hormone is metabolised goes away. In anxiety one feels very restless, fearful, jittery, uncomfortable, negative thoughts, etc.
Now Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD is a mental health disorder. It requires professional help to overcome. It's similar to anxiety but on a 24X7 basis even without triggers.
GAD can be treated by consulting a psychiatrist for checking, diagnosis and prescription of medicines. Another way of treatment can be consulting a CBT Therapist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, talk therapy, which is as effective as medicines.
Regular exercise and meditation, pranayama, also helps in allivieating anxiety levels along with adoption of relaxation techniques.

Living with anxiety might be difficult but there are various self-help guidance techniques that can be practiced for the well-being of an individual. These include:
Social interaction: A support system plays an important role to overcome GAD Social interaction with people who can be trusted is effective in calming the nervous system thus reducing anxiety. It could be a family member or friend. Build a strong social network and interact to avoid being in isolation. Avoid situations or people who make you feel negative or anxious.
Lifestyle modifications: These changes include change in the sleep pattern, diet, regular exercises, limiting the intake of alcohol and caffeine.

802,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.
To completely answer your question: it’s very likely the child will grow up and realise people don’t worry and fret about things as much as they do. This will make them realise they’re different and their GAD contrasts them from how other people think.",GAD
803,"That is a very good question. I suffer from anxiety/bipolar. Yes, I have been anxious my entire life and it did seem normal. It has always had a tremendous impact on my life. When the impact is inescapable, that is what will push someone to get help.
When I reached a point that I was crying all of the time, non-stop, and it effected my ability to get along with co-workers, and I had panic attacks every night and throughout the day, then getting help was unavoidable. The unfortunate part is that the treatment I received was only for depression, and the meds actually made the anxiety worse. Eventually, I was treated also for anxiety, and the meds actually made the anxiety/mania worse. Finally, I was diagnosed with bipolar and the meds were appropriately balanced out. It took a long time to arrive, but I am glad that I finally got the help that I needed!",GAD
804,"If you have anxiety, you're likely aware of it - from reading, talking to people, sharing experiences.
More than anything, having significant anxiety raises your baseline of what's normal in terms of stress. It doesn't necessarily make it easier, or diminish the physical effects - you're just more aware you have it. That awareness can both help and hinder you. It helps if you find coping mechanisms that you can call upon when you recognize the onset of symptoms. It hinders you because it - to a degree - normalizes something that has severe physiological ramifications if not dealt with properly.
I'm used to being ""high strung"". I'm an entrepreneur, and I get it from my father who's also an entrepreneur. I have decided not to take medication (for various personal reasons). The thing I've learned is that - I will never not have anxiety. But I have learned to deal with it better as I get older (I'm 35, married, no children). I understand the triggers, symptoms, and things that help alleviate it. For me, I utilize therapy, exercise, acupuncture, nutritional diet, talking with husband, family and friends - things that make me feel not alone in my anxiety while helping from a physiological standpoint.
Anxiety is triggered by different things and presents itself differently in everyone. You are unique and so are your coping/treatment requirements. Self care is critical. Pay attention to what your body, mind and emotions are telling you. Most of all - remember that you are not the only one, and you are not alone.",GAD

In fact, when I started therapy in my 40’s, (my wife was threatening to leave me after I attempted to quit smoking), I was flabbergasted to hear that I had anxiety.
Seems obvious? Well, not to me. All I knew: something was wrong with me.
I didn’t have it as a very young child (or maybe just didn’t recognize it.) I began to realize that something was different about me in my teens.
“Normal?” Yes, absolutely. But intensely uncomfortable.",GAD
810,"It feels normal for me, I cannot speak for others. Just because it feels normal because of how familiar it is does not mean it feels good though. Once I reached adulthood I knew something wasn’t right and I was tired of feeling awful and I wanted to feel less confused and upset, which is what led me to my diagnoses.",GAD
811,"I think after growing up you notice the bouts of diarrhea and abdominal cramps don't happen to all your friends. With all the anxiety there is often depression. It was when I was diagnosed with that, that I was also told about my anxiety disorder. Then the lightbulb came on and it all made sense. It didn't stop it. But when my stomach started churning at the thought of something new at least I new what it was.",GAD
812,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD

The onset of the actual disorder rarely shows up before teens years, but the person may feel very anxious before the onset of the disorder.

Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
816,I have had generalized anxiety disorder since childhood and yes for many decades I did think it was normal and that everyone felt like this and that I was weak because I didn't handle it well. I was literally in my late 30’s when I saw a commercial on TV for zoloft and recognized the symptoms they said we're related to gad. I immediately made an appointment w my Dr and we started meds. A couple years later I began counseling.,GAD
817,It does become normal. I didn’t know I had GAD until I was a junior in high school and I wen to a therapist for an unrelated isssue.,GAD
818,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
819,"All right, the sad thing is that a lot of people never, ever, get diagnosed with their mental illnesses. I didn't know about mine until I was in my thirties. definitely had problems when I was a child, but I didn't know why, and the people who had care of me really didn't give a damn one way or the other. so yeah, people can go through their whole life without knowing that the reason they have their problems that they have it's because of mental illness. it's not that new of a thing, really, now mental illness has finally been brought into the light. and has been acknowledged as a real illness. instead of some kind of game some people played at. mental illness is a reality. it can be a very difficult thing to accept. it can be a very difficult thing to deal with, knowing that you are not unaffected by the illness. but it is finally being recognized as an illness. just like any other illness. bye-bye.",GAD
820,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
821,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD
822,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD
823,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
824,"Simply music is not the best healer. Medicines are. Now your why? Billions of dollars and battery of bright minds works overtime to find a scientific solution called, pill. Music is an add on therapy, not even alternate. Music ignites sad moments more often than happier ones. Be careful.",GAD
825,"The human brain likes patterns and repetition. It is easier to process something when it can recognise a rhythm. Unpredictability leaves it second guessing continuously, which will increase anxiety.
When you listen to a song, the brain is receiving a predictable, rhythmic input that is stimulating to the mind. This is why we tap our feet, tap our pen on the desk and other such behavior when we're anxious or trying to think. That repetition is a way of self-stimulating our mind and it's the same principle with music.
When we're anxious we're no longer in the present moment, but when we listen to music, our brain has a focal point that puts us back into the moment. This is why it's common for us to get an earworm (song looping in your head), when stressed. It distracts the mind from the chaotic thoughts.",GAD

The interesting thing about the music is that if I wanted to calm down, I didn’t necessarily listen to classical or New Age music. Sometimes I would put on a heavy rock album and blast it. I always had a good stereo system for this. When I’m depressed I can put on something mellow or intricate, like jazz. It totally depends on the circumstance. It is never the same.

829,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions
If you or anyone you know have any doubts about having mental health issues, I advice you to get it checked by a psychiatrist. It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders

832,"Q: “Why does listening to music help with anxiety?”
Anxiety is modelled in the mind somewhat similarly to a fluid that seeks a vessel (container), or that over flows its banks.
The original container for our anxieties must have been the mind of our primary carer/mother, who fielded our incohate fears and persecutions, not always knowing what they were, but thinking her own panics through, employing her own psychic containers, arriving at the comforting responses we needed.
Ever since then, any cultural object - any creative act of human insight and emotional thoughtfulness - has the potential to act as a container for our anxiety, if we can relate to it.
Music most of all.
Although music need have no spoken language attached, it is narrative still, extending as a creation through time. In this it resonates with our pre-verbal experiences, which were the times of transformation.
Narratives make sense of things; they link events and experiences, memory and imagination, in such a way, that if they are emotionally truthful, may weave a container, a vessel for our anxieties. Listening to music, reading literature, allowing all the arts and creative acts of humanity to speak to us, rests on the template of our earliest experience; that of being ‘held in mind' by our mother (carer).",GAD
833,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

834,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy

836,"Yes absolutely but it depends on the kind of music you listen to when you feel anxious or having anxiety disorders—-
such music like Jazz, Soul, and Country Music is a magical therapy on its own. listening to it at night relaxes the mind and body. create your listening pattern like this :
1. Jazz in the Morning
2. Soul in the Afternoon and
3. Country Music at Night
Now this can work for most people but it can also be like a distraction to relieve yourself. but for a fact good music is pleasing to the mind, your brain will release that chemical that helps you feel happy and optimistic.",GAD
837,"Actually yes it does. It relaxes the mind the soul and the muscles. It makes you feel so real in a way of wonderland not in reality. Choosing the perfect music is the most important part. As anxiety, i chose to listen to the really soft music and the soft words to relax and get my soul back to my body in a relaxed way (not real but it was a feeling like this). Christiana grimmie was one of the most amazing voices i heard whenever i had anxiety. I used to take my headphones and in a dark room i rest my head in the bed headphones on and closed my eyes with her voice in my ears. It is amazing. Even though i knew the words it felt like it was new everytime i heard it. I even started to write my own music and try to relax my mind while writing them. When i am sad, angry, tired, gloomy and on my way to anxiety i do all of this without thinking. So yeah it does work. Music became one of the main things i live for until now.
You can chat me up if you want. I am also had anxiety issues before and still facing some but i will always be here to listen to you at anytime!",GAD
838,Yes music can be a very powerful tool for helping with anxiety. The type of music that helps would depend on the person and the musical preferences. It would be a bit of trial and error to figure out what music will work for them. I have seen people respond equally positive to classical or heavy metal. It is really what that person is drawn to musical and what gives them an inner sense of calm.,GAD
839,"Cure is a strong word that implies permanence. There really isn’t any “cure” for anxiety. Anxiety helps to protect us from danger, so we really don’t want to have it “removed”, but rather managed, so that it doesn’t interfere or overwhelm us.
To this point, music can certainly be very evocative and reduce an acute state of anxiety as part of grounding into the present moment. In theory, doing so over regular practice could take the edge off our anxiety baseline levels, ie reducing overall anxiety. However, I am not aware of any studies confirming this of music alone.
Similar to this, for example, if the music is part of a meditation practice, or exercise routine, these have been studied to document reductions in anxiety.",GAD
840,"My answer is purely anecdotal and representative of my experiences only.
I use music to treat anxiety in the following method. During a time of great calm (relaxing, watching a sunset) I listen to a couple specific songs repeatedly. Calm, ambient songs. While listening to the songs I try to mentally link the song and the mood creating an association.
Later in times of anxiety and stress I play those specific couple of songs. It relaxes me markedly and so far has not failed to work.",GAD
841,"Yes, a soothing music often helps you relax your mind. It cuts down the random and concerning thoughts and energies us. This helps in reducing anxiety.

843,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
844,"For me, it works. At night when I feel anxious, I just turn on some music, especially the kind of music that reminds me of the happy moments in my life. And yes, music has this amazing quality of taking you back in time and reminding you of certain events.
So that makes me feel grateful about certain things that happened to me, or certain people that I met in the past or moments that are worth cherishing. The next time you feel anxious at night, think of the kind of music you listened to in the past when you were happy, listen to it again and it should make you smile again.",GAD
845,"Im not entirely sure what you mean by instrumental music groups.
But I’m a big believer that any kind of involvement with music, whether it be playing or listening, can help with feeling of anxiety. the only exception to that would be that listening to music that has a lot of anger, or music that references status symbols like money and sex, could potentially increase anxiety. Plato was very against poetry as he believed it stirred up peoples emotions, leading them to abandon reason, and while im not that extreme (I actually like poetry) it is true that certain types of media can increase feelings of anxiety, just go onto youtube and watch some videos of road rage, or people having public meltdowns and you’ll see what I mean (please don’t actually do that). however, you can exploit this property in a good way by listening to music that is positive and relaxing. personally, I love listening to Shakuhachi music as I find it incredibly relaxing.
as far as playing, I know that there has been research done which shows that singing in a choir is great for mental health, especially since you’re not singing solo so there’s less pressure to be perfect (its ideal if you can find a choir that’s quite casual), but again I think playing any sort of music can help with anxious thoughts, especially if you approach the playing from a perspective of not trying to be a virtuoso player, and just playing to express yourself.
For instance, there is a concept in game theory which talks about finite and infinite games. A finite game has the objective of winning, whereas in an infinite game the objective is ‘play’. I play the piano and from the perspective of a finite game, I should practice for hours a day with the goal of mastering the instrument so that I can flawlessly play very difficult pieces. from the perspective of an infinite game the goal is just to enjoy being able to make sounds and relish having the freedom to play around, even if it doesn’t end up sounding like a great masterpiece.
In the end I suppose I’d say it kind of depends on you and what you feel drawn to, drumming circles might be up your alley, or singing, or playing the ukulele. go with your gut :)",GAD

847,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
848,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

849,"Anxiety is the result of an over active mind, which seeks to feel utterly and completely in control of outcomes, results etc., and in doing so, it keeps on delving deeper and deeper into a state of helplessness.
The best exercise is to repeatedly tell yourself that you are not this mind, body, or the thoughts, you are simply the soul, which is a divine form of energy. Thoughts and emotions are products of the soul. You are the soul. This realization, once repeated often enough, will bring a much better perspective to the situation at hand, and help you view all forms of anxiety from a 3rd persons angle. This is a tremendously simple yet infinitely powerful tool!
There are also some practices such as Yoga, meditation, breathing exercises (anulom velom) which you can learn and adopt in your daily life. If you want to connect with an expert to learn more about meditation or Yoga, you'll find www.thesilverlining.co.in useful. Yoga can teach you how to stay mentally fit, meditation can help calm the mind, and breathing exercises will help to balance out the energetic imbalances in your body. But a word of caution - Do not attempt to practice Yoga or meditation without consulting an expert, as sometimes you may not be able to understand the deeper concepts and downpour of energy on your own.

850,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
851,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
852,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
853,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
854,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
855,"Good of you to ask, for there is much help (spoken as someone who has suffered GAD.)
Depending on how severe your condition is, GAD can be treated by Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or through medical approaches using medication. Or both.
The best way to determine what is right for you is to speak to a mental health professional, be it a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health counselor. You can even begin by seeing your regular physician for recommendations to a specialist.
GAD is treatable, though not always curable. In my own case, treatment has given me incredible relief and the ability to function as I would like.",GAD
856,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
857,"Starting at age 5:
Hyperventilating in stressful situations
Facial twitches
Being so tense in my sleep that I’d pull muscles
Having lucid dreams of being tortured to death when under stress
Panic Attacks
Obsessive negative self talk
Things I didn’t realize until adulthood because to me, it never existed (if you don’t realise these are possible, maybe you should see a therapist):
You can think about nothing.
You can relax and enjoy the moment.
You can make it days without holding tension. (I physically feel lighter without anxiety).
People wake up NOT feeling nervous, and can make it whole days without feeling like ninjas are going to bust out of a closet and attack.
Luckily for me, I have been using neurofeedback for about 5 weeks now, and it has opened my eyes to how life actually is.",GAD
858,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
859,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD

I’ve had anxiety issues so long that I’m hard wired to stim at the first onset of anxiety or a panic attack. I catch myself doing it without realizing how long I’ve been doing it. I finger tap, I count out or spell a few colors that I can see while tapping. It’s not really noticeable or distracting.

862,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help.

863,"By getting counselling while at university (because it’s often free at these places).
And within the sessions, I opened up about some really deep stuff that I doubt many people would have gone through only to realise that for the most part I was fine and wasn't going crazy.
I haven't had very much anxiety for 9 months now and I doubt it will develop again. But through having major anxiety and depression of various forms to becoming mentally stable again i have realised that there's mostly an issue with the thought process in how you go about thinking about things.
It sounds kind of obvious to those with it but it’s quite a major issue when you programme yourself to think in a manner where you’re almost always thinking way too much about something and very deeply which can bring up certain things that may frighten you and because of that I ended up searching on the internet using loaded questions that were sort of creating these self-fulfilling prophecies about worse case scenarios that you think are going to happen or are happening to you and that everyone else is too stupid to think about it in enough detail to realise that there's something wrong.
It may sound stupid to people with the anxiety disorders at first or you may realise it but not give it enough credit but you do over think things way too much and way too often. Not vice vera.
And it’s weird because you get these thought processes that trick yourself (almost unconsciously) into rooting out potential problems within your life and within yourself and inflate the probability of it happening just because the threat could potentially exist even though the chances of it happening are quite often so minute it's negligible.
My main advice would be (from 5/6 years of personal experience of previously having it)
Seek counselling (it’s the best thing I ever did) and actually talk about the problem no matter how ridiculous it sounds or if it makes you teary because they really are used to and trained with handling this sort of thing.
Acknowledge that the anxiety is coming from within the disorder itself and not the things you are anxious about, therefore you be looking into other peoples experiences of anxiety, realise the restrictive thought processes of what you got through that makes you anxious, how they got better and etc rather than assuming the thing you are anxious about is the cause.
Quit caffeine (or at least reduce it) this might sound ridiculous but for myself and others, caffeine really does induce or at least exacerbate anxiety mentally and physiologically for that reason it’s best to reduce it until you’re better. It doesn't necessarily get rid of the anxiety disorder but it does help in managing the anxiety.
Don’t be afraid to start thinking differently (by challenging and not following through with the anxious behaviour) in a way that breaks the anxious thought loops. It sounds ridiculous but the anxious thought patterns feel normal and almost addictive and to think otherwise can seem scary or dangerous when that's simply not the case realistically.",GAD
864,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
865,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD

If you have mild anxiety, maybe even moderate, then sure all these things may help but don't do them on your own. YOU ARE SICK!

Yes, it’s my belief that GAD is increasing. The state of the world is such that we are made to always feel on edge every time we watch or read the news.
And we don’t need the media to tell us that we are validly worried about too many things—our safety (both personal and global), our finances, even our healthcare (or lack thereof). And the problem is that these are all real concerns—hence the apparent increase in GAD.
A therapist recently told me that one way to combat GAD is to ask yourself the following questions:
“Is my thought based on facts or feelings?”
“How would someone I trust see this situation?”
“How likely is it that my fear will come true?”
“What’s most likely to happen?”
“If my fear comes true, will it still matter in a week? A month? A year?”
I’ve found this to be quite helpful when having vague, ephemeral anxious feelings. For feelings of anxiety based on real-life problems, however, not so much. I do, however, find a perverse comfort (and thus a slight lessening of anxiety) in knowing that we’re all worrying about such things, and we’re all in this together!",GAD
869,"No.
Though I am ashamed too (hence the anonymity). I have a personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder, so being ashamed of myself is also one of its symptoms, besides the stigma of this disorder (when I first thought I had depression/bipolar, that was something many of my friends and acquaintances had and there was lots of understanding, but I know much less people with this and less of them are good role models), which is mostly associated with drug abusers and misbehaving celebrities, and besides me having known a person with that disorder who tried hard to ruin an innocent life. Pills have no beneficial effect on me. There is no ""personality replacement therapy"". I have to learn to live with myself.
But, I went through something similar many years ago already, discovering that I am bisexual after growing up in homophobic and especially biphobic environment. I hated myself for it in the beginning, but I learned to accept and even like that part of me. I stopped being ashamed, though I also don't consider it something to be proud of - I was just born that way. I educated others about it, and they gradually accepted it, accepted me with it, even my most homophobic family members.

872,"I know mental illness is very stigmatized but it’s just like any other illness or disorder. You might b ashamed because people around you have looked down on mentally ill people but that is not fair. You might hear things like “It’s all in your head,” or “Everyone get’s sad sometimes,” but you don’t need to listen to them because I don’t know one person who would go up to someone with asthma and say “It’s all in your lungs get over it,” Maybe I’m on the wrong track and this feeling is coming from within and you have people around you who at least try to understand what you are going through but I have felt bad because of outside forces before so if I am right you are not alone.

873,"Of course not, but that doesn't stop many people who are mentally ill from being ashamed of themselves. I think it is often part of mental illness. When people have poor self esteem, or they hate themselves, shame is a partner in creating that self-hatred. Shame probably informs a lot of what people who are mentally ill feel. Sometimes, I think people feel ashamed of everything they do.
But it's not our fault. It's our genetic heritage. Just because we are ashamed of ourselves doesn't mean we have to be ashamed of mental illness. There's a difference. Mental illness is not something we can help, although often, we are told it is our own fault, and we could fix it if we weren't so damn lazy. But there's no need to feel shame for being mentally ill. Indeed, there's no need to feel shame for ourselves for any reason. If we can learn to drop that shame, it really helps in recovery.",GAD
874,"Should you be ashamed of yourself if you are physically ill?
Some people are. I say that no one should be ashamed of being ill, whether it be mentally or physically.
Being ashamed of being mentally ill can lead to not treating it. No one benefits from that.
On the other hand, just like with physical illness, other people can have poor responses to finding out that someone they hire, or work with, or date, has an illness of any kind. So, don't be ashamed, but also, no need to tell every person you meet.
If you had cancer, you would tell only certain people, same with mental illness. It isn't everyone's business. But the people who care about you, will want to know.",GAD

That said, any information about your health is your business. Some people, unfortunately, may not treat you fairly or otherwise behave differently towards you if they know you have depression.

877,"Should you be ashamed because you’re mentally unwell?
No.
Also, 99% of societies and 99.5% of people in them would also say “No!” if asked directly.
However, those 99.5% of people and 99% of societies are full of shit liars who should be ashamed of themselves. Because almost universally any mental health issue (and even a lot of neurological ones) are seen as shameful, secret things. A lot are treated as some sort of moral or spiritual failure on the part of the unwell person.
They aren’t moral or spiritual failings. For the most part nobody has any idea what “mental illness” means. If you have “generalised anxiety disorder”… But you’re surrounded by a large number of things which provoke anxiety quite reasonably… Then how is that a disorder? Or if you were once in a situation where generalised anxiety was reasonable, but that stopped, and now you’re still anxious because you are concerned those things could occur again… How is that a disorder? It may not be idea, but if your anxiety exists for an appropriate reason then it’s probably in some way helping you to avoid dangerous situations. That’s not a disorder. It might not be great, but it’s also not necessarily a “disease” or “illness”.
So no you shouldn’t feel ashamed of a mental illness. Or for that matter, any illness. Shame doesn’t cure many things at all. However, unfortunately, most humans will view you as being somebody who ought to be ashamed. Those people are scumbags though, so try and not pay attention to them.",GAD

I used to believe there was something seriously wrong with me. Like I was different. Broken. This only amplified my anxiety and self consciousness to the point where I couldn’t even look at myself in the mirror. I didn’t want to see myself let alone have other people see me.
I used to wear jumpers in summer on my way to counselling every week just so I could pull the hood over my face to prevent the chance of someone seeing me enter the building. I didn’t want anyone knowing what I was going through. How I felt.
I used to cover my wrists at all costs because I couldn’t bare it if anyone caught a glimpse of the discoloured slits that traced them. I wouldn’t be able to handle all the questions that would follow.

889,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

Phase 1
What happened in the past didn't happen to the you or I of today. It happened to a younger aspect of ourselves, our inner child, if you will.
They suffered the event,we carry the memory of what happened to them, and Sympathy Pains as a show of support, and solidarity with them, for what they went through.
But it didn't happen to us, it's none of our business.
Our younger self is stuck in a state of limbo, unable to cross over, until they have all their baggage, and we have become part of their abuse, by replaying & reinvesting in their trauma in our present.
This is a grievous error on our part, that must be rectified, and we achieve this, in no more than 40 minutes on average

894,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible.

895,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic condition and, like many chronic conditions, it cannot be cured completely. However, it can be managed with a combination of medications and psychotherapy.

896,"Yes.
I personally overcame a GAD (which started with several panic attacks at night); 3 doctors told me that, given the severity of symptoms, in my case it would be impossible to overcome this without antidepressants & sleeping pills first… and they were wrong. I was personally convinced that it was possible not to take these drugs but one told me “you know all patients think they can overcome this but it’s a lure, they’re not doctors they don’t know…”. I’ve literally spent 4 months through hell: recurring panic attacks, 3 hours of sleep nightly, debilitating pains the back that made it impossible to concentrate at work, I had the productivity of a 12-year-old child… But I studied the topic of anxiety and depression and I came to realize 2 things:
Our doctors with 10 years of studies aren’t so smart as they think about this issue, they just prescribe pills that they know “work” which means it hides the symptoms for most people (after trying 2, 3 for many of them) but don’t cure the root cause of anxiety. At best it will break a vicious circle, but your body is a very sensitive system and putting in something that will play with your neurotransmitters for 6-month will obviously alter something in your brain.
Mental disorders are more than we think an organic disease (such as liver cirrhosis for an alcoholic) than “psychological” diseases related to the way we think, childhood memories etc. (Doctors are behaving like all mental disorders are genetic or caused by a psychological trauma but it’s not always the case and in fact I would think that in the majority of cases people develop mental problems due to poor lifestyle which range from unhealthy diet to stressful jobs, toxic people, even heavy metals intoxication: I know this one is crazy but check Doctor’s Mark Hyman videos on YouTube you will see it’s true for thousands of people)
So now let’s do a quick summary of how I did it:
Never take benzos, I took them at first (Xanax) and it worsened the situation so badly, withdrawal was so hard. The only thing I took that was beneficial was Atarax (1st gen antihistaminic), it has a calming effect, helps sleep a little bit but nothing compared to a benzo, and it’s not addictive. BENZOS ARE DANGEROUS DRUGS, to me their effects were 5x more powerful than what I ever experienced with anything else, I couldn’t imagine something that was prescribed by a doctor could actually be a drug more dangerous than some illegal drugs… But it is.
Take time off (like 1-2 month) if your job is stressful in order to concentrate on healing your disease. But see people, friends, family, even animals, it’s key to healing.
HEAL YOUR BRAIN BY HEALING YOUR BODY FIRST. THE SAME THINGS THAT MAKE US SICK ALSO MAKE US ANXIOUS. Anxiety disorder is when anxiety is present everywhere without even being triggered by a negative thought. It’s clearly a brain dysfunction, you have to heal it. In my case it was not because I had bad thoughts that it triggered anxiety feeling in my body, anxiety feelings in my body did trigger bad thoughts. My body had become sick because of months of bad habits. For me that first horrible panic attack started after 4 months of hard partying every friday, saturday, + stressful job with late hours (1–2 in the morning), my body was completely exhausted and sick but I didn’t want to believe it.
Very short term: try soft medicine: acupuncture and hypnosis worked really well for me, but with reliable practitioners not some king of gurus
Short: STOP ALCOHOL, COFFEE AND REFINED SUGAR. You’ll probably be craving all of them for 2 weeks but after this you’ll REALLY feel better. Stop any other excitants if you’re taking them (ginseng etc.). Once you’ve recovered, limit your alcohol consumption to the bare minimum, it’s toxic for your brain.
Short (2 weeks to see the first effects), medium & long term: completely change the way you eat, eat organic food, lots of veggies, fruits, omega-3 fatty acids; add probiotics, vitamins, magnesium & zinc to your diet if necessary, food is the key to healing tons of chronic diseases for which we wrongly use antidepressants (IBS, fybromalgia, depression, anxiety… and even some autoimmune diseases)
Practice sport regularly (3, 4 times a week) but don’t get too hard on you in a time you’re really exhausted. It’s not the right moment to do an iron man.
And? It’s about everything. Another important one is to believe in god and do the good around you.
If you’re really to the point where you tried all this above and it doesn’t work, take ADs to break this vicious circle but still keep all those good habits above so you won’t relapse after stopping the medication. It’s not a shame to suffer from anxiety or depression, we all have to face our own issues, for some it’s obesity, others it’s diabete, for us it’s anxiety. Even if as you can read I don’t trust the pharmaceutical industry (their goal is to make money by selling the most medications as possible, the more side effects the more additional medications to sell) and I think doctors’ arrogance makes them blind about this plague, don’t waste the most beautiful years of your life fighting a disease. If after months and months of all what I told above you still have the problem (which I believe is unlikely though), go seek medication, it probably means your anxiety is related to something else. And as I told above, Atarax worked for me with almost no withdrawal symptoms (but its effect is mild)

Unlike occasional feelings of anxiety, GAD involves persistent and uncontrollable worry that interferes with daily life. Seeking professional help is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Explore my Quora Profile for more information on managing GAD.",GAD
898,"I wish I could say it was cured. I can say it is well-managed. My level of anxiety is 90% less than it was at one time. And that is a good thing.
The cause of generalized anxiety disorder is not fully known. It may be genetic, and the latest research indicates it could even be the result of inflammation in our nervous system. In my case, genetic seems most likely as it runs on one side of my family. And that being so, it explains why I’ve struggled with through my life.
My greatest gains in anxiety were learned, over time. Learning by me, and learning by my health care provider. Initially he relied on medications, then counseling. Yet there was true break through with one session in which he told me that I had to realize that my anxiety has nothing to do with my thoughts—that it was an emotion. Just a feeling. The thoughts only followed as a result. It was like a light went off in my brain—all of my efforts to think my way through anxiety were useless at the time it was occurring.
Over time I realized that if it was a feeling, and one that had nothing to do with reality, then I needed to see it as a medical symptom—just as I would dizziness, sweating, or feeling flush. And to stop “feeding” it with seeking cognitive answers, which were just as likely to increase it as decrease it.
It can’t kill you or me. Anxiety can feel like it will certainly be the end of you, but it is a false emotion—not used on real threat. It will pass. We have to learn to deny the thoughts that it produces.
I also learned that certain activities produced stress that fed into the physiologic roots of my anxiety. My work was very stressful. And when you are under constant stress, it raised your cortisol levels. Not good for us anxiety types. Eventually I decided to make a major change in my occupation specialty. Yes, that was stressful in itself, but, it really helped in the long run. Not everyone needs to do that, obviously. For me it was a no-brainer. I had realized it for at least 20 years, but just couldn’t make the move earlier.
Another major improvement came when I became sick and tired of being anxious. I realized that the anxiety was worse than any of the things I worried about. It’s exhausting. I can remember the day that I shouted out, “Fine! Let the world go up in flames. I don’t care, anymore!”
I don’t mean to present this as a smooth, step-by-step process. There were ups and downs. Things that didn’t work. Times I had to go through the humiliation of my realizing my limits. But I began to learn how to better detect when I was becoming anxious, and recognize my typical failed patterns to deal with it. Often it was learning to simply call it what it was and accept it in many situations.
Finally, I am convince that much of my help has been spiritual—coming to realize that there was a God and that he was not silent. That he was sovereign over the affairs of life. And that there was good intended in my suffering.
Anxiety can be managed, if not cured. My condition now is stable. I choose to remain on a small dose of antidepressant as it prevents relapses. No, it’s not ideal—I would prefer to be off of those entirely but I’m on a mere fraction of what I used to take. I know my anxiety disorder is there, of course, always hiding under the waves of life. But it’s no longer a monster—just a medical issue which can be managed.",GAD

900,"How I “Cured” My Anxiety and Night Terrors
I would never say that I have “cured” my anxiety. That just seems silly.
Would you ever find yourself saying you’ve cured your feelings of anger, lust, sadness, or surprise?
No…
Anxiety, much like the rest of those feelings, are fleeting, and believe it or not, they are not permanent.
My Story
I didn’t always feel this way. When I was 17 and first experiencing the ill effects of too much stress and anxiety, I did what everyone else would normally do- I went to the doctor.
“There must be something wrong with me to feel this way.”
For most of my life, if I felt sick, I went to the doctor who gave me a pill and made everything better. I even got to lay around afterward doing nothing while it worked its magic. How fucking awesome is that!
Western medicine led me to believe this was how health care worked. You feel bad, you take a pill, problem solved. I became conditioned to believe doctors had all the answers.
Then something like anxiety comes along and wrecks your world. Over the 5+ years I spent dealing with anxiousness, panic attacks, night terrors, and hypochondriasis, my beliefs on the system were shattered. Everything I thought I knew about health went right out the window.
I saw doctors, specialists, therapists, you-name-it. Every one of them offered me a pill to make my problems go away. None of it worked.
Each time I saw someone new, I naively hoped he or she would be the one to finally fix my life. With every failed attempt, I slipped further and further into depression.
One fateful night- my “heroes journey” moment as I call it - I had had enough.
I decided no more doctors.
No more feeling like shit.
No more feeling bad about myself.
That night, a fire lit inside me like I had never felt before. It’s like I had hit rock bottom and my only way back to life was to rise to the occasion. Think Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Rises.
The only way to beat Bane was to get out of that miserable fucking pit of doom.
It took far too long for me to realize that I had it all wrong.
Doctors and specialists shouldn’t be who I rely on for my health. They should be my backup plan. I should be my first line of defense.
That’s exactly when I realized how shitty my lifestyle had been.
* I sat playing video games all day long.
* I frequently pulled all-nighters to play video games and then finish my college assignment 1 hour before the 5 AM deadline.
* I ate like crap.
* I drank 5–6 nights per week, blacking out 2 of those, on average.
* I barely exercised, except basketball once per week, if that.
Within 3 months, some simple lifestyle changes drastically improved my situation.
Once I had a reason to change, the tiny shifts in my lifestyle weren’t even that hard to make. Sure, I had to read and learn a few things about healthier living, but in comparison to what I had endured the last several years, that was nothing.
Looking back at my battle with anxiety, there were two big things that I learned:
1. Anxiety, in my experience, wasn’t a disease. It was a feeling that I had never been equipped to manage.
That’s exactly what I tell people these days when asked about my anxiety. I never “cured” it, I’ve learned how to “manage” it.
There wasn’t anything actually wrong with me, at least not in the “I have cancer and I’m slowly fading with each day that passes” kind of sense.
I was just experiencing elevated levels of anxiety for the first time and I had no idea how to manage.
For most of my life, I had been living in a reactive state. If something felt off, I went to the doctor and blasted it away with the best that modern medicine had to offer.
It was time to get proactive.
Looking at my lifestyle, I could see why I felt like an anxious, nervous wreck. The daily activities of my life had been filling up my anxiety bucket, and I had been doing nothing to drain it.
That’s how I view managing my anxiety these days - like a bucket.
If I go for a few days eating like shit and neglecting to exercise, I literally feel my bucket overflowing with anxiety. When I spend a few days practicing healthy behaviors, I return to a balanced state.
My bucket becomes half full, so-to-speak. Right whe...

901,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
902,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,
Katie❤️⭐️",GAD
903,"Nope! I do not know anybody who was 100% cured. I have had panic attacks since I was 8 or 9 years old. It went away and came back when I was 13 years old. Then it went away again. My family supported and helped me a lot. When I was 22 years old It hit hard again. I was pursuing my PhD in physics at the time.
I never avoided any situation that triggered the attacks. I traveled by plane to remote islands to observe. I also climbed mountains and gave talks. All these activities were potential triggers. I always had the panic attacks but endured.
Then the panic attacks went away when I was 32 years old. That was back in 2009. I had been free of them since then.
Just a few weeks ago I was lecturing and I felt a strange sensation in my chest. My vision was blurred and dark for a few seconds. One of my students told me that my face was pale and I changed colors.
I interrupted the class and two students took me to the hospital. I was immediately admitted and had my blood pressured measured and I spent the best part of the day under observation.
They had me take and ekg, an ergometric test, a machine was attached to my chest for 24 hours and they also made me take a dopler image of my heart. They found nothing !
I had another panic attack! The next day I was there lecturing again facing the very situation that triggered an attack.
Yes! They are back ! But I will endure and survive and prevail!
Good luck for all of us !!!",GAD
904,"Cured? No. Managed? Yes.
I have been actively combating my anxiety since I reached high school, and have had anxiety for as long as I can remember. It was bad enough that I went selectively mute for the entire 8th grade.
In high school, I started facing things that scared me, and noticed that I got better and better at these things the more I did them. It scared me in the moment. But the satisfaction afterwards, from confronting my fears and getting things done, that was like a high. I wanted to do more and more for myself. My teenage ambition to be independent came late, but it showed up.
The social anxiety was by no means cured, but it got lessened enough in the first two years of high school that I was able to make some school friends for the first time in my life, and I could talk to them. That was an achievement for me.
Then shit happened (it’s a long story), and a psychiatrist forced me to take anxiety medication. Those pills reversed everything I earned in under a semester.
This medication forced the physiological symptoms of happiness (there’s this feeling in my chest I get when I’m happy, and the drug simulated that all the time). Then it took control of my life.
What I did on those drugs was so bad, I don’t even want to mention the specifics. It was bad enough that all those “friends” I made were too embarrassed to be seen around me. The pills controlled me into losing my friends. Real life improvements for sure.
On top of that, the effect the drug had on my memory caused me to forget how to do all those things I had pushed myself to do before taking the drugs. I wasn’t happy inside, but had no control over myself during that time. The drugs chose everything, did everything.
But the pills couldn’t force me to take more. I stopped taking them entirely, facing withdrawal head-on.
It has been 3 years since that day, and I’ve gained back everything those pills took from me in the meantime. They slowed me down, and set me behind. At 20, I’m not quite all adult, but I’m close enough to say that I would have been if not for the pills. By this summer, when I turn 21, I’ll be able to say I live a normal life despite my anxiety.
Working on anxiety without medication is far closer to a cure than any pill. Hands down.",GAD
905,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.
I can tell you that it works more than anything I tried since I was 16.
Please try and give us your feedback after a few months.",GAD
906,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

907,"Personally, I have no clue. Everyday is a struggle. I can only speak from personal experience but I’m sure others with the diagnosis would agree.
I wake up with chest pains and find it hard to breathe. I’m already anxious when I open my eyes. I have BPD am dysthymic as well, so I often feel like a flaming car crash.
I’m constantly thinking and replaying events and conversations in my head, adding fuel to the flames.
Most days I just try to wait it out until I can sleep. And I rarely get a restful sleep.
I’ve been put on Zoloft but it hasn’t even been a week yet, so I haven’t noticed a change.
This morning I decided to meditate for 25 minutes, because I was tired of the alternative. (Pacing, biting my lips, hyperventilating, sheer panic and frustration.)
Mediation helped a lot! For a while. I’m going to try and implement it into my daily life.
I haven’t been able to hold a job. I isolate myself everyday. I rarely go outside, and when I do I’m afraid of everyone looking at me in judgment. I avoid everyone. It’s a big day for me if I spend more than 20 minutes outside—or if I go out at all.
You know what used to help me get through the day? Copious amounts of marijuana. Unfortunately, smoking constantly wreaked havoc on my stomach and I was in the ER for violently vomiting. Could not eat a thing.

908,"The problem here lies in your question. How to CURE anxiety.
The word “cure” implies a battle with a condition and that by fighting it with a particular technique you may be able to beat it.
I have lived with chronic anxiety for decades and for a long time was approaching the problem in similar way. I tried all sorts of things to fight the condition, always thinking that there must be some new method that I hadn’t yet discovered to combat the problem.
Eventually I realised that the way to deal with anxiety is not to fight it (it seems that this can actually make it worse sometimes) but instead to completely and utterly accept it.
When you are feeling anxious and your body is doing all sorts of strange things in response (believe me, I have had every physical anxiety symptom you can think of over the years), then just completely and utterly submit to it. Think to yourself “I am anxious right now. My body feels very bad, but so what? I’ve been through this many times before and eventually this sensation will start to subside.”.
Through total submission and acceptance, the intensity of your anxiety attacks will slowly start to reduce. Don’t expect a quick improvement or any improvement at all for that matter. Instead just keep on accepting it. Eventually by not focusing on your anxiety so much, it will become less prominent and you will be able to live more of a normal enjoyable life.",GAD
909,"I know this is very difficult and seems impossible, and may be impossible, humanly speaking. I’ve learned something over the last 40 years. When I can’t do something … when it is truly needed and impossible for me to do … I’m in a great position. I know who can help, who always has and always will. I never know how He will do it, but I have proven over and over that He will though the solution may also be a long difficult thing to do. That keeps me depending upon Him.
In Matthew 19, the disciples of Jesus were discussing how difficult it is for rich people to be saved. They asked, “Who then can be saved?” His reply:
26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

910,"Anxiety is a symptom of an emotional issue. You have to work on root cause of it and work on deeper layers of self.
This process is called healing. Learn some method that you feel good about or take help from people who help professionally if you want .
You have to observe what triggers it and how does it make you feel, is it fear of something known or unknown, do you feel panic, is there irritation, repetition of thoughts etc.
Also further work needs to be done on what emotional wound are there in deeper layers which are causing it.

911,"When someone is experiencing anxiety issues for a long time, it is natural to want to get rid of this emotion completely, with all its implications: unpleasant physiological symptoms, repeated concerns, the need to check or avoid various things. But it is important to understand that anxiety is not always a problem, on the contrary, it is often a valuable ally.
Anxiety should be seen as an instrument - like an alarm system mounted on a car.
This tool was developed by the human mind because it serves an important adaptive purpose: it protects us from potential danger.
Anxiety, however, becomes a problem when this instrument becomes disruptive and produces more costs than benefits. For example, the alarm system of our car is disturbed and at the slightest vibration, the force is triggered as if someone were knocking on the door.
We don't go to the mechanic to ""heal"" our car - that would mean removing the alarm system completely, which would expose us unnecessarily to a greater risk: not knowing ourselves or others when someone threatens our car.
Similarly, eliminating anxiety in our lives would mean exposing ourselves to the risk of not detecting when we or our loved ones are in danger. Moreover, anxiety is an important motivating factor in our lives: how often do we not learn more for an exam because we are anxious about success? Or we are more focused on a task at work or we attach more importance to life events.
In many situations our success is due to the extra effort we invest due to the anxiety we feel in the face of uncertainty.
Therefore, a more appropriate question is this: Can we treat anxiety problems? Can we fix this tool when it brings us more costs than benefits? And the answer is ""Yes!"" However, we must be aware that chronic anxiety problems cannot be fixed by a single drug or therapy session. It takes work and patience for the intervention to work.
And how long the treatment lasts, depends on each individual, the type of treatment and the surrounding environment.

912,"I cannot confidently say that I have overcome panic attacks fully. I developed panic while I was on treatment for depression and anxiety way back in the late seventies. At that point the treatment for depression and for that matter any mental disorder was very limited . Only in the nineties it improved after the discovery of SSRIs and new benzodiazepines starting with alprazolam. SSRIs and benzodiazepines helped me to overcome depression and panic attacks for a long time . In 2017 ,the toll of taking these medications began to show up due to weight gain and water retention to mention two of the prominent side effects. I was forced to go off the medications cold turkey resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms. These included panic attacks which forced me to go to the emergency department of a hospital near my house 3 times. It took 4 years or so to get over the ill effects of stopping these medications.

913,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life. People with GAD often experience persistent and excessive worry about everyday activities, such as work, health, relationships, and personal safety, even when there is no apparent reason for concern. This excessive worry can interfere with their daily functioning and quality of life.
Here are some key features and symptoms commonly associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder:
1. Excessive and uncontrollable worry: Individuals with GAD often find it challenging to control their worrying thoughts. They may worry excessively about a wide range of topics, including personal health, work, family, finances, and global issues.
2. Difficulty managing uncertainty: People with GAD may have an intense need for predictability and may struggle with the uncertainty of future events. They may constantly seek reassurance or engage in excessive planning and preparation.
3. Physical symptoms: GAD can manifest with various physical symptoms, including restlessness, muscle tension, fatigue, irritability, difficulty sleeping, headaches, stomachaches, and other physical complaints.
4. Cognitive symptoms: Individuals with GAD may experience racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, and a persistent sense of unease or dread. They may have trouble making decisions and may feel on edge or constantly ""keyed up.""
5. Emotional symptoms: GAD often involves heightened levels of anxiety and emotional sensitivity. Individuals may feel anxious, overwhelmed, irritable, and may experience mood swings.
6. Impairment in daily functioning: GAD can significantly impact a person's ability to carry out everyday tasks, fulfill responsibilities, and maintain relationships. It may lead to avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, and a decreased overall quality of life.
The exact causes of GAD are not fully understood but are likely to involve a combination of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Traumatic experiences, stressful life events, and a family history of anxiety disorders may also contribute to the development of GAD.
Treatment for GAD typically involves a combination of psychotherapy, medication, and self-help strategies. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is often used to help individuals identify and modify negative thought patterns and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or benzodiazepines may be prescribed in certain cases to help manage symptoms.

General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!

917,"For me, it involved a lot of ruminating and imaginary scenarios about anything and everything that could go wrong (catastrophizing). It could start off as a single “what if”, followed by another. And another, and another. These thoughts would dovetail off of each other until they became so overwhelming that I was emotionally distraught in a matter of minutes.
A lot of these thoughts had a negative spin that twisted my self-image to the point of being socially and emotionally stunted.
Taken together, these created a vicious cycle of horrible thoughts that prevented me from seeing that things may not be as bad as I thought they were. So I would avoid taking chances that could prove everything was okay, but that only reinforced the ideas that I was a defective and unworthy person.
Any tips I would have for someone who is dealing with GAD would be to
Look for social support in the people around you, and be brave. Ask them to help challenge you in ways that will affect your thought patterns. (Tough love is uncomfortable, but it pays off)
If you can afford to do it, FIND A GOOD THERAPIST. Preferably one who specializes in Anxiety Disorders.
Do some self-reflection and try to get to the bottom of your fears. Inspect the things that you say to yourself and ask yourself if these thoughts are reasonable.
[Be extra careful here. People will bend over backwards trying to justify their thoughts-even negative ones]
Be patient and kind to yourself as you figure out ways to cope. It can take years until you develop the skills to create healthier habits, but don’t let that stop you! It is SO worth the effort.",GAD

I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
919,"I swear that from the very first dose of venlafaxine (non-generic form is called Effexor) my depression & anxiety felt MUCH better. Usually it takes at least a month, or supposedly as little as two weeks, for an SSRI or an SNRI to really kick in. Tbh I felt high/drugged on venlafaxine, but I was in such a dark place that I liked it, & over time it just felt like I naturally as a person didn't have anxiety anymore. I did get EVERY side effect on the list, intensely, but I was so mentally ill that o fought through it and after quite a while they went away. When I went off it thinking I was well, it was a rude awakening. Unfortunately I now suffer terribly from anxiety & depression… I built a tolerance to venlafaxine. The dose ended up gradually getting raised from 75mg all the way to 300mg. Pregabalin (Lyrica) used to help me with anxiety at at least 150mg 2x/day, but probably more like 300mg 3x/day would have been much better. A lot of people like Zoloft but I didn't. I should stipulate that my anxiety is generalized but largely social… Also benzodiazepines work excellently for all/any anxiety. It's just that because they're addicting, virtually no doctor will presribe them :( . Just trying to give you some recommendations… There are of course a lot of CBT, exposure therapy, that kind of thing you could do also or instead… Not sure how long they usually take to help.",GAD
920,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before.

923,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
924,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.

926,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD

928,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
929,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
930,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave.

931,"Hey,
Same problem here. I used to go to bed at 12 PM and fall asleep at around 2 AM. Just couldn’t get a handle on those worry-filled thoughts.
What I found extremely useful was the 4–7–8 breathing technique.
Here’s how you do it:
Breathe in through your nose while counting to 4.
Hold your breath while counting to 7.
Breathe out through your mouth while counting to 8.
Repeat
But aside from this exercise, I suggest you focus on sleep hygiene as well. In other words, make sure you:
Go to bed and wake up at the same hour each day
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances after lunch.
Avoid screen time two hours before you go to bed.
I know everybody’s looking for a quick solution but in my experience, improving the quality of your sleep depends greatly on making some changes in your daily routine.
Hope my answer proves helpful. :)",GAD

933,"It is absolutely possible to cure anxiety. What worked for me was learning Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) and Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). There are other methods like EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), PSTEC (Percussive Suggestion Technique) and more.
What it boils down to is finding out what’s underlying your anxiety, which is usually beliefs you’ve formed early in life, and changing it.
So, ask yourself, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?” What do you have to believe about yourself, other people, interacting with other people, the world, and life in general, in order to feel anxious?
Write down everything that comes to mind. Do this exercise for a couple of days because you might get new answers on different days. Keep doing this until you can’t come up with any new responses to the question.
I usually recommend starting with EFT because it’s pretty simple to learn and the emotional change is fast and profound. Emotional Freedom Technique is a natural method of neutralizing negative emotions and thought patterns by using acupressure and talking through (basically venting) what is upsetting you.
Go on Youtube and look up EFT for beginners and look for the video by Jessica Ortner. EFT is going to look strange. It involves tapping certain places on your face (acupressure points) multiple times and saying things related to the issue. Just give it a try. If you want, you can also look up EFT for anxiety and follow along with some videos.
After you learn the EFT process (it’s not hard), apply it to everything you wrote down when you asked, “What do I have to believe is true in order to feel the way I do?”
Also, you can use it whenever you’re feeling anxious, upset or any other negative feeling like angry, sad or anything else.
Something most people have an issue with when they are new to EFT is not knowing what to say when they tap. The best way I’ve found to get around that is to imagine you’re talking to a close friend about whatever is bothering you and just vent as you tap. Get all of your thoughts and feelings out about the situation as you tap through each of the points. You will find that this works very well.
If you’re interested, I would be happy to work with you on your anxiety. I’ve helped a lot of people overcome their challenges. Just let me know!",GAD
934,"Anxiety is a really confusing thing to sort out, as someone who got lost in the world (and sometimes still do) here is what I have found helpful and even life-changing.
First of understanding how “tricky” anxiety can be is key, it can take you to a really weird or dark place very quickly and will make things seem way different then they are in reality. The number one resource I recommend for this is a book called “hope and help for your nerves” by claire weeks.
It is a little dated but it is a “must read” if you are suffering with anxiety.
Second understand that this can get better, no matter how bad it seems you can unwind your anxiety (and get it down to “normal” levels) At my worst it seemed like a maze where there was no possible way to get out, this was very difficult and frustrating, I felt broken, desperate and hopeless and yet with some steady changed I got out of that mess and you can too.
Here is what helped:
six years ago I was in a very bad space, panic attacks, depression, thinking i was crazy and desperately searching for an answer, the right therapy, the right “diagnosis” the right medication, I wanted “the fix” so bad.
After relentless searching and research I started to realize something, the path out of my mental mess was actually pretty simple, not easy but simple and that is what I want to share with you now.
This is going to sound a little cliche but acceptance is the very first step. It is VERY important, (here I will refer you again to the claire weekes book mentioned above it goes into depth on this)
Once I start accepting where I was at I was able to start making progress instead of repeating the same day over and over again, but it did not happen over night.
At my worst I was isolated, smoking weed and eating and drinking to cover up my feelings, barely able to hold a conversation at social events and lying in my bed in terror…praying for a solution.
When i started to accept how bad it was and this was what I had to contend with it opened the door to making any little change that might help, where as before I would just say there is no point (I would go for a run and then just feel like giving up)
So here are the changes I started to make:
I started meditating (check out dan harris 10% happier and headspace)(about 2/3 months in this had a massive impact and my panic attacks stopped)
I started reading and practicing ‘acceptance and commitment therapy” - just google it
I discovered that lifestyle is connected to our mental health in a huge way and that western medicine is not much help when it comes to really healing from anxiety and depression (they have meds and counselling which can only “prop you up”, I recommend kelly brogans books to learn about this)
At this point I realized that “labels and a diagnosis” would not help me and the taking responsibility and ownership was the only way to truly heal, I had to take my power back from doctors and see my symptoms as information to be listened to rather than things to be pushed down or supressed..
I started a whole foods and then ketogenic then carnivore diet (this evolved over time)- this was an utter game changer and drastically improved my life, my mood got better, my confidence improved, everything got more stable.
The final piece was realizing that I needed to do things in life that i was excited about, that i cared about even if they seemed stupid… work, play, friends, family… it all matters and if you ignore your inner voice then you will suffer for it, this takes time but listening and then trusting yourself is key.
This all takes time for me it was a few years, there is much more I have left out but this is the path
acceptance, understanding, lifestyle change and then relationships and fulfilling activity
Looking back I can’t believe how far I have come. So don’t give up! little by little make changes.
You got this, hit me up with any questions!",GAD
935,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
936,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
937,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.
To completely answer your question: it’s very likely the child will grow up and realise people don’t worry and fret about things as much as they do. This will make them realise they’re different and their GAD contrasts them from how other people think.",GAD
938,"Here’s an average school day:
A.L = Anxiety Level, 0% being completely calm and 100% being anxiety attack.
6:45 AM - Wake up and hope that my legs aren't paralyzed from social anxiety. If so, I have to wait two to three hours for it to go away. [A.L: 30% normally, 50% if woke up from nightmare]
7:00 AM - Try to block out my mother’s and sister’s arguing to hurry up when both of them are on their computers/tablets, or when my sister refuses to get up and my mom has to get her dressed. Music with noise-canceling headphones usually do the trick.
7:30 AM - After telling me when she gets home later that afternoon and checking to see if my legs are paralyzed, mom takes my sister to school, I stay on the sofa listening to music.
10:40 AM - Nine times out of ten, my legs heal and I’m able to slowly walk around the house. I get dressed, wash up, and get out the door with my messenger bag by 10:45.
10:50 AM - Deep breaths as I walk the half mile to school, listening to music as I go down the sidewalk. Because my brain didn’t remind me about the medicine (sometimes even if I get a miracle and remember), every time a car passes by, one or more of the following thoughts goes through my head:
“Pedophile.”
“If the car pulls up beside you, run.”
“Please don’t get near me.”
“Don’t be a crazy person and try to run me over.” (Even though I’m on the sidewalk.)
“Just keep walking.”
11:00 AM - If I left correctly and paced myself correctly, I arrive at a ten-foot-long crosswalk that is at the entrance to the student parking lot. My school, like any high school, has a lot of rude teens. I stop at the crosswalk, look both ways and down the road to check for cars, and speed-walk to the other side while holding my breath as if I was trying to commit a crime. [
[Off chance I get there at 11:02 - Cars fill the entrance as each driver tries to get onto the main road. I can feel their judging eyes on me as I approach the crosswalk. I could feel their annoyances as they only want to go to lunch and don’t want to wait a second longer because some crazy walker girl decides to come to school at this exact time. I make my first step, making eye contact with the driver as my pace speeds up and I run to the other side. Although, if I wait long enough, someone else could be on the other side of the crosswalk. The pure blessed coincidence lets me know that it’s safe to cross without getting yelled at, as I’m not the only one crossing. I make it to the other side and take a deep breath. I survived.]
11:05 - I meet up with a couple friends and we chat and play around during lunch hour. It often starts with me going up to our second-floor meeting spot and me apologizing for being out of breath and tired. They both nod and say it’s okay, as both of them know about my anxiety. It’s only during this time when my defenses are lowered. [A.L: 20%, 40–70% if trigger passes by.]
12:03 - Bell rings, I say goodbye and go to my first class (everyone else’s fifth class). I happen to have something called “Office Aide”, where I get to help out the administrators in the discipline office. For me, it’s a social exercise. Whenever I’m not called to do something, I hang out in the staff lounge and listen to music (bonus points if I’m the only one there, excluding the occasional admin or two). Occasionally I get to deliver papers from one office to another, or manage the printer for a teacher who needs copies.
However, there is one activity that is the most common, and by far what I hate the most: Pass delivery. Which requires organizing the passes from nearest to farthest away, mentally highlighting the fifth period classes for each student, and checking every ten seconds to make sure they are in correct order and I didn't make any mistake. Then it’s opening the door and having 20–23 pairs of eyes following my every step and action, while I have to keep my eyes on the teacher, who I just interrupted their lesson with something from the office. As soon as I give the teacher the pass(es) and explain what they’re for in short sentences, I do a 180 u-turn and bolt right through the door. Once I get through, I take a breather and go on to the next classroom. Repeat as needed.
The next couple classes are easier. The teachers know I have GAD and give me permission to listen to concentration music to block out all the other background noises from other classmates.
After school, I meet up with my friends again, chat, and then head home. Repeat 11:02 behavior except everyone wants to go home and are even more reckless. Honking makes me jump and bolt to the other side, only crossing the crosswalk when others are crossing at the same time as me.
Same paranoia with walking home as in the morning.
3:00 PM - I unlock the house door and collapse on the sofa after taking off my bag and changing out of my collared-shirt uniform to something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m being lightly choked. Start slow work on writing and homework, as well as completing all necessary assignments for online classes-
5:00 PM - A weird taste gets in my mouth as I wake up from accidentally passing out and having no memory how I got to the sofa or how I managed to fall asleep. Realize the time and panic for a little that I only have 30 minutes before mom and sister come home.
5:30 PM - Chaos ensues. Katie starts shouting and pulling my very-tired mother to go play with her on Minecraft or Roblox, not caring that she’s been working a min-paying job for seven hours. I have no-where to go to escape. My mom retreats to her room to nap, while my sister puts on her earphones and shouts for mom to go to her. I end up being the middle-man and play messenger until I remind mom that she’s a mother. I put on my headphones and lower my 70% anxiety with more music and watching videos.
This continues until my grandmother likely comes over and I have to hide, least a panic attack would be triggered and I’d be punished by her for not fully calming down in 15 minutes and that I’m “crazy”. (She’s no help is my point.)
10:00 PM - House is blissful. Mom and sister are asleep, I’m on the sofa again either typing stories, reading and answering Quora questions/articles, playing Sims 4, or researching psychology.
4:00 AM - Insomnia holds me hostage. I have stared at the ceiling for hours. Every little sound I hear wakes me up like a monster is trying to get into the house. I have a light on in the living room to keep me out of the dark and so I have full sight of my immediate surroundings. AC unit kicks in every once in a while, my mind often mistaking it as some madman trying to invade the house by going through the vents, same with creaking of the door or leaves bouncing along the ground outside by the wind.
This repeats every day. It changes very little during weekends and school breaks; Everything around me is terrifying, leaves scare me, people remind me that I don’t belong in this world, and my family is just another obstacle for me to overcome along with my anxiety. I write a lot as a result; writing is my escape path. I wish I can write more, but I don’t want to annoy you with long things to read. ^_^
That’s my daily life with anxiety. I have my good and bad days, and every day is very draining. My family tell me to be more social, that I should be this or that like what other teenage girls do. I ignore all that crap and focus on taking care of myself and know where my limits lie. I have GAD because of my surroundings, but now I try not to let my surroundings summon what it created.
To anyone else reading these answers who have GAD, you’re not alone. Take care of yourself and stick by those who truly care for you. :)",GAD

942,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).

When I reached a point that I was crying all of the time, non-stop, and it effected my ability to get along with co-workers, and I had panic attacks every night and throughout the day, then getting help was unavoidable. The unfortunate part is that the treatment I received was only for depression, and the meds actually made the anxiety worse. Eventually, I was treated also for anxiety, and the meds actually made the anxiety/mania worse. Finally, I was diagnosed with bipolar and the meds were appropriately balanced out. It took a long time to arrive, but I am glad that I finally got the help that I needed!",GAD
944,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

946,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD.

947,"This is very interesting question for me, as I have been a friend and only a friend, to someone who has suffered this for over 30 years.
If you care enough or love the person then you will learn to “handle” what they can throw at you.
It can and will be stressful at times, but I take a deep breath and have a break and clear my head.
It is a waste of time and energy to argue with them, but you cannot give in too much, just appease them and hope you are winning the mental war that is going on in their head. Find a happy medium.
Then I am ready for the next round.
It can strain any relationship of any kind, whether it is love or just friendship. But as long as people try to understand what the sufferer is going through and can be strong enough to cope, there will be moments when you want to give up, but then you realise there is no one else around to help them. So what do you do?
The main thing about any mental illness and people who live with someone with it, is the understanding what that person is going through, what it must be like to have this sort of illness, that cannot be controlled easily, as they reject medication through phobias and fear etc.
If you are in a relationship with one that had GAD or any mental illness you only have two choices - one is to walk away and not want to help them, or Two is to stay and help and get to know more about the illness and understand what is happening and how it affects them, but you must be strong minded and have very broad shoulders to take the insults, mood changes etc. etc.
In answer to you question, it is and can be a great strain on any relationship, but it is up the the person to decide if they stay and help or go and leave them to it. Simple as that.",GAD
948,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
949,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
950,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..

953,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety.

It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
954,"To have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder is to live everyday with constant anxiety. What makes it ""Generalized"" is that the subject or ""cause"" of the anxiety is arbitrary. It is normal and natural to experience anxiety about certain things in our lives. Public Speaking and job interviews tend to top the lists of most common causes of normal anxiety. When you are anxious about those things, your mind is on overdrive working through all the possible scenarios and embarrassments, and you may also experience physical discomfort like dry-mouth, excessive sweating, a pit in your stomach, and nausea, among other things. It is considered to be a pretty uncomfortable experience, to say the least. However, most people only think about anxiety within the context of the thing causing it (that speech, for example), or that time your loved-one was in that car crash and you didn't know anything about their condition until you got to the hospital (and what a nightmare that whole experience was). You might have even experienced, or heard anecdotally, that the ""not-knowing"" was the worst part, because at least once you had some details you could begin the process of coping with the reality. Well, that terrible state of ""not-knowing"" is the essence of anxiety. It can be sort of an odd thing to think about being in that state without the understandable triggering event, but what an anxiety disorder is, in very simple terms, is when that trigger is MUCH more sensitive than normal, and in many cases can get stuck in the ""on"" position. Those feelings are caused by chemical reactions in your body and brain as a response to your brain's processing of a certain situation in the physical world. In that way, you can see that there is a ""pairing"" aspect between a state that your brain perceives and the feelings then associated with that perception. In a generalized anxiety disorder, there is an unnaturally elevated presence of the feelings (could be thought of maybe like a leaky ""seal"") and so the brain will then have to pair up things on it's own because it doesn't know what else to do (it is programmed to have those feelings associated with some undesirable ""state""). So with GAD it is the pervasive presence of the feelings of anxiety due to a chemical imbalance that is the cause of paired thinking. Let's go back to that car crash example. Someone you don't know calls you and says ""are you the brother/sister/wife/husband/parent of X? they have been in a high speed auto collision and are being airlifted to Hospital Y, that's all I can tell you."" and then they hang up. At this moment, whatever else is happening in your life has stopped immediately, your mind cranks up into over drive an the only thing you can think about is this person. ""will they be okay? What if they die? What will I tell their friends? What will I do? No, no, don't think like that, they'll be okay. What if they never walk again? Do I need to take anything with me to the hospital?"" Try if you will, to really imagine this, what it would feel like, if you haven't had the misfortune of actually experiencing it. The rest of the world seems to go on like normal, but everything else is secondary to this over-arching ""thing"". Few people, I would think, would take the time to dress their hair up or ponder over which pair of shoes to wear with their outfit... Additionally, let's say, on the way to the hospital your pal calls you to ask for some advice on an up-coming meeting. I'd venture it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to re-focus your attention towards the details of your pal's queries while you're currently wondering whether or not your loved one is going to die. I wanted to really focus on this example because one of the most crippling aspects of an anxiety disorder is that it literally hijacks your brain into spending a lot of time and energy worrying about things that make no sense to worry about. I was diagnosed with a severe generalized anxiety disorder 12 years ago. I've been taking medication for about 10 years now so I'm getting better (and yes it takes 10 years or longer, depending on the severity and type, to ""heal"" from an anxiety disorder because it is such a complex thing, the brain). You can tell now that I have been able to successfully compartmentalize the disorder from myself and my identity. However, even after I was able to rationally defeat certain worries in my head, I was still not able to stop the intrusive worries. To someone who has not been diagnosed or is unaware of their condition, GAD is basically a living nightmare where you are always overwhelmed with the fear of some great unknown... and your mind will generate subjects to attach the worry to. For example, I used to worry constantly that I was suicidal, or could be suicidal... that makes no sense... someone who is actually suicidal is considering ending their own life, but I was only worried about how bad it would be to consider ending my own life, while at no point actually considering it. See? My brain concocted an artificial paradox that couldn't be empirically tested beyond constantly inwardly harassing myself (as opposed to, say, worrying that my pants would be unzipped at tomorrow's meeting and everyone would see it... as I could take measures to ensure that my pants were zipped, by zipping them...) My example is relatively severe, some people can just be excessively worried about things that are normal to worry about, but to such an extent that it interferes with normal life activities. However, things like ""excessive"" and ""normal"" can get fuzzy in many instances and mental disorders can intermix with each other with varying symptoms being more or less prominent depending upon the individual. Which is why all disorders exist on a spectrum and can be complicated to diagnose. This was just the little abridged version of my personal experience (very abridged), but maybe, hopefully, someone somewhere could be able to benefit from my take on it.",GAD

Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

960,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
961,"Generalised anxiety is different for every single person who has it.
You over think and then some! You can be convinced people dislike you, you worry they think you're strange or don't like your opinion.
The night before ANYTHING is a bloody nightmare. Seeing your partners parents who you've known for 4 years and love dearly? Yeah, let's have a meltdown for 6 hours and not sleep one wink!
The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
962,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
963,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
964,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
965,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
966,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
967,"When I’m nervous it is definitely with a reason- I get nervous when I interview for a job, I get nervous when I have to ask a big question, I get nervous talking to my boss- all are regular and alleviated within seconds of doing the act I am in fear of.
When I get anxious, it isn’t as simple. Anxiety creeps up sometimes on a car ride and somehow I feel like breathing is the most difficult thing that I need to actively think about to calm down- but it doesn’t calm me down.
I can be stuck in my tracks and get light headed and physically ill being anxious and needing to escape somewhere- but no where feels entirely the answer. It makes me physically shake and tremble and I get moderately nauseous and dizzy, so I try to excuse myself to the restroom or somewhere to lay down. But anxiety, definitely doesn’t have a reason , sometimes my body’s chemistry goes into overdrive on adrenaline and I get really worked up, and I can’t calm it down immediately.
The longest phase of anxiety for me was roughly 2 hours lon...

968,"Yes, even if they are episodic or infrequent. You need to learn to cultivate good thoughts, to make them part of your perceptual repertoire. Someone once said, there is nothing good or bad, but that thinking makes it so. In the course of the day, you will have thousands of thoughts, and you need to choose which perceptual filter to pass them through. Will your thoughts be ones that uplift or oppress you? You control the gateway, so examine your thoughts as they transition through your psyche to determine their intent before you indulge them and allow them free reign within you. Difficult? - - Yes, but with practice and determination, you can become a better gatekeeper, and attune yourself to the messages with which you flood yourself.

970,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
971,"No,it’s not.
General anxiety can occur from time to time,during difficult periods of your life or even when you change your envirorment and trying to adapt to all those changes which it brings.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder(GAD),on the other hand,is a whole different thing.
You worry excessively and a lot,so much so that it interferes with your daily activities.
(GAD) symptoms include:
Persistent worrying or obsession with small or large concerns that's out of proportion to the impact of the event
Inability to set aside or let go of a worry
Inability to relax, restlessness, and feeling keyed up or on edge
Difficulty concentrating, or the feeling that your mind ""goes blank""
Worrying about excessively worrying
Distress about making decisions for fear of making the wrong decision
Carrying every option in a situation all the way out to its possible negative conclusion
Difficulty handling uncertainty or indecisivenes
Fatigue
Irritability
Muscle tension or muscle aches
Trembling, feeling twitchy
Being easily startled
Trouble sleeping
Sweating
Nausea, diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome
Headaches",GAD
972,"Starting at age 5:
Hyperventilating in stressful situations
Facial twitches
Being so tense in my sleep that I’d pull muscles
Having lucid dreams of being tortured to death when under stress
Panic Attacks
Obsessive negative self talk
Things I didn’t realize until adulthood because to me, it never existed (if you don’t realise these are possible, maybe you should see a therapist):
You can think about nothing.
You can relax and enjoy the moment.
You can make it days without holding tension. (I physically feel lighter without anxiety).
People wake up NOT feeling nervous, and can make it whole days without feeling like ninjas are going to bust out of a closet and attack.
Luckily for me, I have been using neurofeedback for about 5 weeks now, and it has opened my eyes to how life actually is.",GAD
973,"your daily Stress may lead to restlessness, irritability, lack of sleep, constant worry and anxiety. These could be signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Living with anxiety might be difficult but there are various self-help guidance techniques that can be practiced for the well-being of an individual. These include:
Social interaction: A support system plays an important role to overcome GAD Social interaction with people who can be trusted is effective in calming the nervous system thus reducing anxiety. It could be a family member or friend. Build a strong social network and interact to avoid being in isolation. Avoid situations or people who make you feel negative or anxious.
Lifestyle modifications: These changes include change in the sleep pattern, diet, regular exercises, limiting the intake of alcohol and caffeine.
i know its difficult but you can do it.
also it would very helpful if you find a good psychologist.",GAD
974,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
975,"OK, I have generalized anxiety disorder. Basically you are afraid of nearly everything. You have social anxiety and panic attacks about everything and probably a lot of phobias too and it's all rolled up into one little diagnosis that takes over your whole life.
I panic when the phone rings, I panic if I'm around people I don't know, I panic if I have to stand in line, I panic if I have to drive or if someone else drives (usually, I'm OK if either of my daughters drive but not any of my sons) you've heard of fight or flight? It's like being stuck in flight mode. I worry about everything, even stuff that i absolutely know isn't going to happen and always think the worst outcome of a situation will always happen. I can have panic attacks standing in my living room folding laundry. For me I also have agoraphobia which basically is the fear of leaving your house because someone might see your panic attacks. To I've gotten very good at hiding all but the worst of them.
I take a couple antidepressants and a mood stabilizer and a whole handful of other psych meds. It keeps my depression at bay but doesn't even begin to touch my anxiety.
Now I'm not a doctor by any means. I'm only telling you what MY generalized anxiety disorder is like. Get counseling, it really does help if you can find a counselor that you're comfortable with. Good luck",GAD
976,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
977,"Good of you to ask, for there is much help (spoken as someone who has suffered GAD.)
Depending on how severe your condition is, GAD can be treated by Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or through medical approaches using medication. Or both.
The best way to determine what is right for you is to speak to a mental health professional, be it a psychiatrist, psychologist, or mental health counselor. You can even begin by seeing your regular physician for recommendations to a specialist.
GAD is treatable, though not always curable. In my own case, treatment has given me incredible relief and the ability to function as I would like.",GAD
978,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
979,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD
980,"In my case, it is like a big giant hand is around my stomach and just squeezing it and anything I cannot touch me. I feel like I am walking on eggshells. Most of the time I just want to sleep, take it away to get away from everything that’s going on in my mind. I constantly worry. I’ve got so much going on in my mind and in my life that is so negative right now. I cannot eat and I cannot sleep. I lost my older son in a horrific car accident and that began. The worst anxiety. And for his little brother as well. He is fighting opiate addiction to get away from the memories that haunt him. Some days I am just afraid to leave the house. I don’t wash my hair or bathe. It takes too much energy. I have been on every antidepressant in the world. I have had 45 TMS therapies on my brain. And I still cannot escape the pain that is in my head that transfers into my heart… I don’t love, my husband. My husband has turned violent. Since the loss of my older son who was shining star. I have sought much therapy, but he will not go. He has gotten very physically violent as of late, and I will not going to details. I but I am afraid of him. Anyhow, that’s my anxiety. And I cannot tell you how to get over it. Some people do well with antidepressants or anxiety medication. So if you can talk to your doctor, figure out which is right for you and be very honest and maybe you can get the right answers. I wish you welll. 🙏🏻",GAD
981,"For me at least, having been diagnosed with MDD in around 1998, it was then that I realized I had been suffering from it for 20 years and didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was prescribed a drug called Zoloft and I was depression free for one whole year.
Anyway, I thought once the prescription was up, I was free with depression. It was the best entire year of my adulthood as I was about 35. I stopped taking the drug and nothing can compare to the depths of depression I experienced about 2 weeks later, and the following 20 almost.
So I experienced it for almost 20 years with out knowing it. I experienced 1 year free from it, and the next 20 years almost, knowing what was wrong and nothing helped.
Not knowing caused me, or let’s say set the stage for what became a life of solitude. It started with losing interest in everything. My circle of friends dwindled to nothing. My love life became such that a couple months would be the longest I could do before ending it. And what was worse was I could not explain why and the hurt I caused only magnified my depression until I stopped seeing women altogether. I swore I would never hurt anyone again. As it happened I met a woman that wouldn’t take no for an answer. My loneliness became my weakness and I married this woman, had a child and divorced 18 years later. I married for all the wrong reasons. And my wife held on and some how endured my bouts of depression.
I guess I only mentioned all this to give some perspective on not knowing what was wrong. To being able to actually have a long term relationship and a child to starting over with the experiences that gave me the insight and, I believe as good a person as any to answer the question.
MDD is a depression that comes back about every 3 months maybe, takes about two weeks before you hit rock bottom. You basically live under the covers for a couple weeks. Then 3 weeks or so to come back out.. My life was one big preparation for the next bout. No friends, a close family but completely separate lives. I lived alone, worked alone and as a tradesman who dealt with maybe 3 or 4 people and not often or for more than a few minutes. I could not commit to anything. A family trip, a favour, and never took vacations.
In short.
Although I somehow managed to hold on to a living, a marriage and even a child. With the exception of my daughter, MDD literally ruined my life. My work was during the dark times something I could do in my sleep. My marriage was a shamble from the beginning. I missed out on what could have been a pool of great friends, perhaps a job I enjoyed and maybe even the girl of my dreams, or at least a sex life maybe.
The overwhelming sadness is indescribable since there’s no explanation for it. The loneliness is a savour, since the opposite was too hard. And then throw in a series dose of anxiety and you go from profound sadness to debilitating fear. Too afraid to leave your bedroom, answering the phone was out of the question. A knock on the door, heart stopping.
Today 2023 at 60 years old and all but beat the depression and although mostly struggle with anxiety, I can say that every thing I’ve said is without exaggeration, and from different perspectives. How I managed to overcome what eventually became chronic depression is another story. There is a silver lining in every story and thank you for asking because I believe mine was worth telling.
In short, what’s it like to live with major depression disorder? It is nothing short of an overwhelming sadness with the added bonus of being in a nightmare called anxiety. And the aftermath of big gaps in the long term memory, It still can be very difficult to be in a group of people more than 3, and the curiosity of wondering what if.",GAD
982,"Well, I have both and it’s like having absolutely no interest in doing anything for days, weeks, maybe months. Then once you actually have that bit of energy to go out, make a phone call, invite a friend over, etc., you’re too anxious to. Keep in mind, I also have a little bit of agoraphobia.
Focusing on one at a time though:
Having MDD makes me constantly feel ashamed of myself. Everyone looks at me like I'm just being lazy and making excuses for myself. I feel disgusted with myself a lot too when I don’t do my laundry, shower or take the dirty dishes out of my room. The feeling of depression however is like a pit in your chest. It will feel like my heart is missing at times. Sometimes it’s a little harder to breath. Most of the time it’s not super bad, it just feels how you feel when you need to take a deep breath, but that never goes away. The world seems a little darker too. The sky is less blue, the clouds are more grey, everyone’s smiles get bigger though. Like the world is mocking you. I’ve taken a lot of medication for it and I’ve come to the realization that I may have TRD. Not everyone has that issue though and had I just had regular depression, I probably would be feeling a lot better by now.
GAD is worrying about everything that could go wrong. I can’t make phone calls, I just started being able to answer the phone, thinking of random scenarios that may or may not happen and have nothing to do with your current situation. For example, I think a lot about what if one of my cats just died right now. I would have no idea, because I don’t see them and I’m not checking on them and it would be my fault. I also think a lot about how everyone is lying to me. Like when I was younger, on Halloween, I never wanted to go to school dressed up because I was convinced everyone was playing a massive prank on me and I would be the only one dressed up. I didn’t want to tell anyone that though, because what if I told them and they thought I was stupid. It’s a lose lose kinda situation. It’s constant fear. The severity differs from person to person.
That is just my experience. Everyone is different :)",GAD
983,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
984,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,

985,"Terrible. Horrible. Thanks to the medication I do have good days but some days I don’t even want to venture out of my room. It really is no fun and having the “stigma” of Mental Illness just makes it worse. Many people still do not realize how debilitating living with a mental illness can be. A lot of people still do not think that mental illness is real and believe that most sufferers are “faking it”. It shou;d be “mind over matter” and that you should just “snap out of it” and show no empathy and have zero sympathy! That is what living with serious mental illnesses is like! Believe me, I know what I’m talking about…especially having battled with depression, anxiety and P.T.S.D. for over 29 years. This is no exageration, there have been times when the mental pain coupled with the physical pain from my hernia when I have begged GOD to let me die! So yes, it is no picnic!",GAD
986,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
987,"To say it is like living in hell is a gross understatement. Unless you have taken action, I suggest calling 911 and that you should be in a hospital equipped with a psychiatric unit. Be very honest with them about how you feel. Be extremely vocal about suicidal ideation. They should be able to set you on a path that will culminate in you feeling almost normal again. Give it some time. Try not to feel guilty, especially for wrongdoing that you never did in the first place.
I derived complete relief from MDD using Sinequan decades ago.
I don’t have GAD. But I’m sure my other anxiety disorders are at least of the same order of magnitude as GAD.
God bless you!",GAD
988,"When I was a kid I didn’t know about ADD and didn’t get diagnosed until I was 40. So as a young person and up til I was 40, I always thought there was something wrong with me that was a problem no one else had.
I was distressed by the difference between who I was on the inside versus how I ended up acting. Blurting out stuff I wished I hadn’t said was hard on me, not to mention others who did not appreciate my unwelcome insights. Also if kids were being funny and then turned serious, I did not keep up. I would get odd looks for laughing at something that was sad. I would have to replay the tape in my head to see where the issue was. It was hard to make and keep friends. On the other hand, the friends I did make were great people!
In my teens I intuited that I just was never going to be able to do (stay on top of) all that other people did. While I tend to clutter up my life, I am vigilant about trying to keep it simple. I didn’t think I was very smart because I didn’t make good grades. Fortunately my first husband saw the stacks of library books I plowed thru each week and kept suggesting that I go to college. And when I ran out of steam my junior year he would read the local weekly job ads for work at Campbell Soups and Levi factory to remind me why I was going to college. (Thanks). I did get thru college and later I did get a Master’s but that was with help from a friend who was in the same program - we would remind each other to do the work and she helped me study for comps - the final huge test at the end of the program. Before that I was in a different program and there were 4 of us who ended up doing all the work on various ‘group projects’ so we made a point of taking classes together and then informing the professor that we 4 would be working together. They were great! I would sit in the upper right corner of the class and the 3 of them would sit around me to buffer me from the idiots in class that would flip thru the book while the professor was talking or file their nails or other awful distracting things. Adult students mind you.
I try to respect my limitations. I try to say no. I only start 4 craft projects at a time, and not start another until I finish one. But is ok to read 5–10 books at a time from different sections of the library - I like how my mind connects the topics and one thing informs the others. I’ve had a housekeeper, usually a personal friend for some reason, from as soon as I could afford it. When I was working I just accepted that it probably took me longer to do detail work than other people so I cheerfully spent some of my weekends doing work just to keep up.
When younger I was thinking on several tracks at once and could easily participate in 3 conversations at a time but that was not generally appreciated so I would read a book and listen to one conversation in an effort not to overtalk. Now I crochet or play Boggle on my phone to not talk as much, and my mind is more one track.
I’m sensitive to light, sound, distractions, and never enjoyed music like other people do because even if I really really focus I can’t hear all the words and focusing like that is not fun. I have a plethora of lists of things To Do in various categories of life. I rely on Gmail calendar to keep track of my appointments and to do’s for each day. My other lists on the desktop image just so I can see it every time I sit down. Right now I’m trying to follow thru on all the tests my doctor wanted me to do since my physical in March, or was it January. I’m not sure I have all the memo’s so am going to have to have the nurse check for me. When I travel I usually leave a trail of stuff at the various locations. When I would walk straight to the office from my classroom, somehow there would be something missing out of my hands never to be seen again. I am great at organizing and cleaning, but tidying is beyond me. I used to try to follow all those efficient housecleaning suggestions but decided that wandering around the house is more exercise and more interesting way to do it. My husband doesn’t waste time being annoyed about me misplacing things, he just helps me find it.
I’m happy to be in the age of computers for cut and paste versus editing and retyping. I like spreadsheets for organizing just about everything and the Drive for taking it with me.
I think out of the box, like about everyone I meet, enjoy the moment, and have adapted to my weaknesses by capitalizing on my strengths. I can’t be bothered to be dishonest as it is too much work. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to have a normal mind and a mouth that doesn’t run away with itself. People seem to enjoy my humour. I’m interested in pretty much everything. I’m calmer than I used to be.
The first and best online chat group I was in was an ADD group. It was so much fun with the multiple conversations going on (one was totally backwards) that I was spoiled for the chat groups where t i m e s l o w l y goes by while people compose their thoughts. Quora is a nice way to share thoughts with others, no waiting.
That’s not it in a nutshell, there is more but I figure it is already more than anyone would want to read.",GAD
989,"I’ve had GAD for ~20 years. Ditto for major depressive disorder. (The two interact in a complex way, but basically having an episode of one makes the other worse.)
I’ve found the following to be very helpful in managing my GAD:
Regular aerobic exercise (bicycling, brisk walking, running, swimming, aerobics exercises). What works best for me is exercising 3–4 times/week at an intensity that stops my brain and body from worrying/brooding for at least 30 minutes.
Doing something that I enjoy that requires focus. For me, that means playing a musical instrument, woodworking or working at the computer.
In addition to other meds for depression, I take 1–3 mg of Klonopin daily. I’ve been on that dosage for 10 years under the care of the same psychiatrist I’ve seen for ~15 years. I see him at least every 3 months with more frequent visits if I’m going through a particularly rough patch. In my opinion and based on my own experience, “don’t take benzodiazepines” is a decision that must be made by you and your doctor. If you can manage your anxiety without medication, great. If not, there are many alternatives to benzodiazepines that could work well for you. Personally, I haven’t found anything else that is effective.

990,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

I can't pretend to speak for anyone else who suffers from GAD, but for me, I develop an inability to concentrate on anything for any length of time.
My sleep patterns become restless and disturbed. I have unsettling dreams that I'm either arguing with someone, or that I'm being chased.
My breathing becomes very shallow.
I tend to be very on-edge to the point that I get over-sensitive to pretty much everything.
Sometimes I second guess everything that I do.
Occasionally I will lapse into people pleasing as well. I often feel like I have to be something I'm not.
The worrst part of it for me is feeling slighted too easily. It can change my mood in an instant.
I also cannot seem to calm myself down, even when I try.
Sometimes I nap just to pass the anxious feelings. It tends mostly to be a short-term fix.
At its worst, anxiety can last for weeks. As for me, it's been and off and on thing the last 2 or 3 weeks.

993,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

994,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
995,"To have a Generalized Anxiety Disorder is to live everyday with constant anxiety. What makes it ""Generalized"" is that the subject or ""cause"" of the anxiety is arbitrary. It is normal and natural to experience anxiety about certain things in our lives. Public Speaking and job interviews tend to top the lists of most common causes of normal anxiety. When you are anxious about those things, your mind is on overdrive working through all the possible scenarios and embarrassments, and you may also experience physical discomfort like dry-mouth, excessive sweating, a pit in your stomach, and nausea, among other things. It is considered to be a pretty uncomfortable experience, to say the least. However, most people only think about anxiety within the context of the thing causing it (that speech, for example), or that time your loved-one was in that car crash and you didn't know anything about their condition until you got to the hospital (and what a nightmare that whole experience was). You might have even experienced, or heard anecdotally, that the ""not-knowing"" was the worst part, because at least once you had some details you could begin the process of coping with the reality. Well, that terrible state of ""not-knowing"" is the essence of anxiety. It can be sort of an odd thing to think about being in that state without the understandable triggering event, but what an anxiety disorder is, in very simple terms, is when that trigger is MUCH more sensitive than normal, and in many cases can get stuck in the ""on"" position. Those feelings are caused by chemical reactions in your body and brain as a response to your brain's processing of a certain situation in the physical world. In that way, you can see that there is a ""pairing"" aspect between a state that your brain perceives and the feelings then associated with that perception. In a generalized anxiety disorder, there is an unnaturally elevated presence of the feelings (could be thought of maybe like a leaky ""seal"") and so the brain will then have to pair up things on it's own because it doesn't know what else to do (it is programmed to have those feelings associated with some undesirable ""state""). So with GAD it is the pervasive presence of the feelings of anxiety due to a chemical imbalance that is the cause of paired thinking. Let's go back to that car crash example. Someone you don't know calls you and says ""are you the brother/sister/wife/husband/parent of X? they have been in a high speed auto collision and are being airlifted to Hospital Y, that's all I can tell you."" and then they hang up. At this moment, whatever else is happening in your life has stopped immediately, your mind cranks up into over drive an the only thing you can think about is this person. ""will they be okay? What if they die? What will I tell their friends? What will I do? No, no, don't think like that, they'll be okay. What if they never walk again? Do I need to take anything with me to the hospital?"" Try if you will, to really imagine this, what it would feel like, if you haven't had the misfortune of actually experiencing it. The rest of the world seems to go on like normal, but everything else is secondary to this over-arching ""thing"". Few people, I would think, would take the time to dress their hair up or ponder over which pair of shoes to wear with their outfit... Additionally, let's say, on the way to the hospital your pal calls you to ask for some advice on an up-coming meeting. I'd venture it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to re-focus your attention towards the details of your pal's queries while you're currently wondering whether or not your loved one is going to die. I wanted to really focus on this example because one of the most crippling aspects of an anxiety disorder is that it literally hijacks your brain into spending a lot of time and energy worrying about things that make no sense to worry about. I was diagnosed with a severe generalized anxiety disorder 12 years ago. I've been taking medication for about 10 years now so I'm getting better (and yes it takes 10 years or longer, depending on the severity and type, to ""heal"" from an anxiety disorder because it is such a complex thing, the brain). You can tell now that I have been able to successfully compartmentalize the disorder from myself and my identity. However, even after I was able to rationally defeat certain worries in my head, I was still not able to stop the intrusive worries. To someone who has not been diagnosed or is unaware of their condition, GAD is basically a living nightmare where you are always overwhelmed with the fear of some great unknown... and your mind will generate subjects to attach the worry to. For example, I used to worry constantly that I was suicidal, or could be suicidal... that makes no sense... someone who is actually suicidal is considering ending their own life, but I was only worried about how bad it would be to consider ending my own life, while at no point actually considering it. See? My brain concocted an artificial paradox that couldn't be empirically tested beyond constantly inwardly harassing myself (as opposed to, say, worrying that my pants would be unzipped at tomorrow's meeting and everyone would see it... as I could take measures to ensure that my pants were zipped, by zipping them...) My example is relatively severe, some people can just be excessively worried about things that are normal to worry about, but to such an extent that it interferes with normal life activities. However, things like ""excessive"" and ""normal"" can get fuzzy in many instances and mental disorders can intermix with each other with varying symptoms being more or less prominent depending upon the individual. Which is why all disorders exist on a spectrum and can be complicated to diagnose. This was just the little abridged version of my personal experience (very abridged), but maybe, hopefully, someone somewhere could be able to benefit from my take on it.",GAD
996,"Simple answer to your question is: it is hell, living with GAD.
When I was a kid, I had no idea what it was, I just assumed everybody woke up feeling sick with worry that just around the corner, doom waited for you. It was my normal, but I hated it, I hated it so much, and would have done anything to get rid of it. It tarnishes everything, you see, even the most positive and happy occasions in your life can be tainted by the thought it'll all come crashing down around your ears at any moment.
I was finally diagnosed with GAD in my twenties. It made so much sense, and gave me something to aim for: I had a name for what was wrong with me, and therefore a framework with which to understand myself and my engagement with the world. But no pills worked, no therapy worked. I stayed anxious. There was no rhyme or reason to it; it strikes seemingly at random, and when it does it is so potent, so powerful, it is impossible to ignore.
In my thirties I had a breakdown, and I really had to face up to myself to get through it. Part of that was trying to accept the anxiety as a part of myself, and to show that part some compassion. I used to talk to it when it came on. I’d say, ‘Listen, I get it. I know you're scared. I know you're just trying to take control.’ I'm sorry to say this didn't work, either.
Then in my forties I got diagnosed as being on the Autism spectrum. This was yet another difficult revelation, but one which I have tried to use pragmatically. I know now that there IS rhyme and reason to my anxiety after all. At times when it seems to come on randomly, there's actually very good reason for it: sensory overload (which I'd never even recognised before) being the primary culprit. Understanding this, that anxiety is co-morbid with autism, has made an enormous difference to me. I am using mindfulness now, to address these issues, and so far it is working out really well. I don't know how much you know about meditation, but to take as the object of my contemplation, how anxiety feels inside my body (the nausea, tension, scrambling thoughts etc.) really helps to diminish the feelings themselves.
How? you may wonder. I believe it is that once I'm watching the anxiety, there is a realisation deep-down that I AM NOT the anxiety. That is such a crucial understanding: your anxiety is just one thought in your mind amongst many, just one feeling in your body amongst many. You could choose to concentrate on a thousand other thoughts or feelings. This disconnect, this knowing YOU are NOT your worries, I have found the single best treatment for anxiety (and, I may say, other mental health conditions, as well). I really cannot recommend mindfulness strongly enough. Give it a try. It's not easy, and takes practice, but it really does pay dividend. Good luck to you.",GAD
997,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
998,"It is highly dependent on the stage at which one is at and what kind of traits of ADD one is mostly suffering from.
Honestly, till the time I didn’t discover that I had ADD, I had a pretty low self-esteem and took things personally because I used to make careless mistakes such as leaving keys at the wrong place, being late for things, work related issues, distorted priorities, forgetting small things, forgetting to update my parents for trivial things, etc. and everyone around you blames you for these things. After a while it becomes pretty apparent that there is somethings wrong and even if you try hard you still can’t do it, until the time you conscious put daily efforts to manage your ADD.
The ADD mind however is a very creative and impulsive mind(which is the best part), it sees things very differently and generates solutions for any possible situation. But, because of this hyperactivity and high degree of creativity, it becomes difficult to only stick with one thing. An ADD person would start working on one problem and after a while because of the impulsiveness he would work on other problems, there are so many solutions to things around that it becomes difficult to prioritise and take action leading to less productivity and spreading oneself too thin. ADD’s are not lazy, the way people label them.
I have observed that because of the difference of wiring of the mind, a lot of things that I consider to be obvious aren’t that obvious to people around me, so I have to consciously first think about what are the missing pieces of information with the other person or what things/ideas I am assuming that other person must not be aware of. This makes it very difficult for me to relate with other people.
And yes, reminders. I have to put a lot of reminders for almost everything to make myself remember.",GAD
999,"By getting counselling while at university (because it’s often free at these places).
And within the sessions, I opened up about some really deep stuff that I doubt many people would have gone through only to realise that for the most part I was fine and wasn't going crazy.
I haven't had very much anxiety for 9 months now and I doubt it will develop again. But through having major anxiety and depression of various forms to becoming mentally stable again i have realised that there's mostly an issue with the thought process in how you go about thinking about things.
It sounds kind of obvious to those with it but it’s quite a major issue when you programme yourself to think in a manner where you’re almost always thinking way too much about something and very deeply which can bring up certain things that may frighten you and because of that I ended up searching on the internet using loaded questions that were sort of creating these self-fulfilling prophecies about worse case scenarios that you think are going to happen or are happening to you and that everyone else is too stupid to think about it in enough detail to realise that there's something wrong.
It may sound stupid to people with the anxiety disorders at first or you may realise it but not give it enough credit but you do over think things way too much and way too often. Not vice vera.
And it’s weird because you get these thought processes that trick yourself (almost unconsciously) into rooting out potential problems within your life and within yourself and inflate the probability of it happening just because the threat could potentially exist even though the chances of it happening are quite often so minute it's negligible.
My main advice would be (from 5/6 years of personal experience of previously having it)
Seek counselling (it’s the best thing I ever did) and actually talk about the problem no matter how ridiculous it sounds or if it makes you teary because they really are used to and trained with handling this sort of thing.
Acknowledge that the anxiety is coming from within the disorder itself and not the things you are anxious about, therefore you be looking into other peoples experiences of anxiety, realise the restrictive thought processes of what you got through that makes you anxious, how they got better and etc rather than assuming the thing you are anxious about is the cause.
Quit caffeine (or at least reduce it) this might sound ridiculous but for myself and others, caffeine really does induce or at least exacerbate anxiety mentally and physiologically for that reason it’s best to reduce it until you’re better. It doesn't necessarily get rid of the anxiety disorder but it does help in managing the anxiety.
Don’t be afraid to start thinking differently (by challenging and not following through with the anxious behaviour) in a way that breaks the anxious thought loops. It sounds ridiculous but the anxious thought patterns feel normal and almost addictive and to think otherwise can seem scary or dangerous when that's simply not the case realistically.",GAD
1000,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1001,"Honestly, I wish I knew. most everyone has some form of anxiety, even if they never know that what they feel could be anxiety. But I feel as if living without it would be simple. You wake up and go about your day without the constant feeling like something will go wrong or the fear that you'll have to interact with some one or do whatever triggers the anxiety, it might seem easier but in my honest opinion I wouldn't want to live without it… maybe just have it a little less. But my anxiety has made me who I am and has made me study psychology because I want to help others like me. Anxiety has made me stronger emotionally, and I think living without it would be so much easier than with it but it's wouldn't make me stronger.
Life is possible without anxiety, and I wish I could give you a concrete answer but I can't, I am only give an idea of what it could be like.
I hope this makes sense, I tend to babble and just write whatever's in my head even if I am just going back to random Idea that I moved past already!",GAD
1002,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1003,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
1004,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1005,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1006,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1007,"Hi Moses;
Yes, sweating is definitely a sign of anxiety. There are other signs of anxiety, however, for it to come to the level of a disorder.
Feeling nervous, restless or tense.
Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom.
Having an increased heart rate.
Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation)
Sweating.
Trembling.
Feeling weak or tired.
Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry.
If you have a lot of these symptoms when you are speaking to someone, you may and I stress may have social anxiety. I am not a mental health professional and cannot make a diagnosis, especially with as little information as you have given. I do advise you to go see your doctor. Anxiety can have some very serious adverse affects on your physical body.",GAD
1008,"Experiences fluctuate with circumstances and self awareness. Shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, lump in the throat, hands go numb, can’t think straight, wanting to run from whatever is causing these highly uncomfortable symptoms. I have gone to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack. My body tingles and my skin crawls all at the same time. If I can catch myself at the beginning of feeling anxious I can sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I can talk myself out of having a full blown anxiety attack. It takes practice. Thoughts of worry, doom and gloom, and then a strong feeling that something bad is going to happen can be overwhelming very quickly. I force myself to BREATH; sitting up straight and taking in some slow deep breathes. Then tell myself to STAY IN THE MOMENT and concentrate on what I can do at that very moment. Not what I should or should not have done yesterday nor what I have to do tomorrow. If left to their own demise my thoughts can chase me around in circles until I am exhausted and wishing I could disappear. Anxiety, for me. is a symptom of FEAR and I have too many fears to count. Like I said it takes self awareness and practice as a way to help make anxiety manageable. But to be honest I don’t know if I will ever be at a point in my life where I can be without my anti anxiety medication for those times when I can’t control it on my own.",GAD
1009,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
1010,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
1011,"When I’m nervous it is definitely with a reason- I get nervous when I interview for a job, I get nervous when I have to ask a big question, I get nervous talking to my boss- all are regular and alleviated within seconds of doing the act I am in fear of.
When I get anxious, it isn’t as simple. Anxiety creeps up sometimes on a car ride and somehow I feel like breathing is the most difficult thing that I need to actively think about to calm down- but it doesn’t calm me down.
I can be stuck in my tracks and get light headed and physically ill being anxious and needing to escape somewhere- but no where feels entirely the answer. It makes me physically shake and tremble and I get moderately nauseous and dizzy, so I try to excuse myself to the restroom or somewhere to lay down. But anxiety, definitely doesn’t have a reason , sometimes my body’s chemistry goes into overdrive on adrenaline and I get really worked up, and I can’t calm it down immediately.

1012,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
1013,"Starting at age 5:
Hyperventilating in stressful situations
Facial twitches
Being so tense in my sleep that I’d pull muscles
Having lucid dreams of being tortured to death when under stress
Panic Attacks
Obsessive negative self talk
Things I didn’t realize until adulthood because to me, it never existed (if you don’t realise these are possible, maybe you should see a therapist):
You can think about nothing.
You can relax and enjoy the moment.
You can make it days without holding tension. (I physically feel lighter without anxiety).
People wake up NOT feeling nervous, and can make it whole days without feeling like ninjas are going to bust out of a closet and attack.
Luckily for me, I have been using neurofeedback for about 5 weeks now, and it has opened my eyes to how life actually is.",GAD
1014,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
1015,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD

Public speaking, exam preparation, results, looking at crush, a random phone call, being called out to answer something in class, animals or being my authentic self… these bring out anxiety in me.

1017,"This is not a description of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, however, you are experiencing anxiety and any time you begin avoiding situations in order to ease your anxiety, then you are heading for GAD. It is just a matter of time.
It's helpful to look after your health, for sure, and drinking more than 3 0r 4 cups of coffee per day is not healthy, but the deeper reason for your anxiety is not physical. Anxiety is the physical result.
The deeper reason is your creativity and imagination in predicting terrible catastrophes. It is your keenly-developed skill at coming up with nasty answers to the question, ""What if...?"" It is you trying to predict every possible outcome in order to prevent any of the bad ones from happening.
There are infinite possibilities for how things can go for you. Get a strategy that is based on the firm knowledge that you can handle anything that life gives you, no matter what. Even your own death.
Ultimately, this is what living with GAD will teach you. But why not just bite the bullet and figure out the lesson now, rather than going through all that misery? Anxiety and panic, avoiding situations where you might get what you want out of life, constantly worrying about how to control the future ...this is not a fun way to live. It is based in fundamental mistrust of yourself.
Instead, start asking yourself ""What if I succeed?"" ""What if my life is meaningful and important?"" ""What if many good things happen?"" ""What if I have a great time?""",GAD
1018,"Because we have jobs, marriages, children, homes, schooling, etc etc that all need to be protected, and we rightly believe that if people knew about our anxiety, we could be fired or rejected or abandoned or suspended. We know that because we’ve already experienced this; now we are sensitized, and all we can do is hide it, until it progresses so far, we can’t hide anymore, and either succumb to treatment or lose everything and age miserably. Maybe these beliefs are true, perhaps not, but that is how GA affects beliefs. And many of us don’t even realize free-floating anxiety is not a baseline state; I didn’t know until late-30’s.
One of the coolest women i ever met became my best friend for years. Once she told me that the first thing that happens when she awakens is an overwhelming desire to end her life consumes her … every single day! Then she had to take measures to shake it off and not give in to the impulse. I’m very perceptive of human behavior, micro expressions, body language, voice tones, and so on,as all MDs in my field learn, but there was no hint with her. All her feelings were under permanent lock-down; later she confessed her anxiety had also caused alcoholism, so she had to deal with that as well. I never even knew.
It was the strangest feeling in the world to have the anxiety lift; it took a lot of getting used to. Every aspect of my perception changed, along with outlook. And there emerged so much emotional and physical energy that used to be consumed by anxieties, phobias, flashbacks….
Anxiety is one condition that qualified MDs can really alleviate these days. They can sort out the diagnostics and treatment plans and adjust medications if needed, and then I believe therapy is mandatory if the patient can benefit; the therapist will let a patient know if they think no more progress can be achieved., but that is unusual, as talk/education/understanding really help remission.
And I support any holistic measures that can also alleviate anxiety. I find lavender, sage, and sandalwood scents really mellow me out. And of course the obvious: sleep, nutrition, exercise, pleasant socializing, etc. And if we live alone, pets are a wonderful addition to these measures. I acquired a rescue cat that was abandoned and she ended up being my very best companion; she seems to know exactly when I need comfort and otherwise, she’s exploring the neighborhood. I know a lawyer that was awarded a service dog she can take with her anywhere; she can’t go anywhere without him, so puppy allows her to function very well.
Finally, there are ways to acquire musical pieces that are designed to lower anxiety. I can play them right on my computer through Google. The science of sound is an area being studied extensively, as we are learning certain types of music/sound can lower anxiety or increase energy, awareness, etc. My cat was traumatized severely, so she suffers too when it is storming because she was abandoned and then suffered weeks of monsoon weather howling all that time; she finally wandered onto my deck, but would not eat or drink anything, not leave my side for a second, could not sleep. My husband is the one that thought of music, and sure enough, I played the “cat tranquility” music and she relaxed and passed out in about 20 seconds; it was like frikkin magic. She immediately started eating, drinking, and slowly becoming independent. That was a great lesson for me; music designed to treat conditions is advancing quickly.",GAD
1019,"GAD can be successfully treated, but sometimes it takes years of therapy and medications. It can be so severe as to prevent the sufferer from having functional relationships, and they often cannot hold down a job.
Short answer: It really sucks and serves to isolate the sufferer from the outside world, which leads to severe depression and even suicidal ideation. That's why it's so important to get treatment.
I suffered from this condition for many years. I have friends who are still dealing with it. It's heartbreaking to know my friends can be so much happier if their GAD was properly treated.",GAD
1020,"For me, it’s the experience of a constant, heightened awareness that does not seem to let up. It occurs especially in situations where I am surrounded by others, at an airport, for instance. It feels like every conversation, every moment of laughter, every time a baby cries––seemingly normal, harmless human behaviors––are happening “to” me, not near me. It’s often a low-level feeling of fear, of nothing in particular, that rides along with me wherever I go. For me, it’s a hard one to pin down since it is comorbid with other mental health issues––it can be hard to know which issue is causing which feeling I’m having at any given moment. It could be the case, for instance, that the hyper-focus I experience as a result of my ADD could be causing me to be more conscious of my surroundings than I usually am, which could then, hypothetically, predispose me to experience symptoms of anxiety. It would be nice to have some kind of switch for controlling the level of stimulation I allow into my consciousness. I’m trying meditation for this… but that’s another topic.",GAD
1021,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
1022,"A key component of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress is panic attacks. There is also a stand alone disorder called panic attack disorder. Panic attacks are associated in many instances with GAD.",GAD
1023,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
1024,"Short answer: definitely.
Long answer: I think when you say hallucinate you mean to say “distort your best assessment of the stuff around you”. This is something that can happen a little or a lot. When it gets to be a lot, I suppose you could use the word hallucinate.
Anxiety is also something that can happen a little or a lot. When it gets to a very high level, you can be so full of worry that you become convinced that there are threats all around. Even when you have less anxiety, you’ll probably be distorted. Basically, as anxiety increases, so does distorted thinking, but it has to get really intense before you’ll be having your own private reality.
The thing to do is to know, even when you’re tripping out, that it’s the anxiety, not the truth. Then follow a plan you make for coming back to the ground. For example, you get certain that the stranger next to you is talking about you to his friend and you’re in a cold sweat because everyone’s thinking about you negatively all around. You hold tight to the knowledge that this is an absurd thought (unless you’re naked or shrieking, etc.). Then you follow your plan: get to a safe space, create a calming environment, whatever that looks like for you, call a trusted person whom you’ve already contracted to be there at moments like this. You listen to them tell you what is probably the real deal. Then you write down what just happened and how you were really being paranoid because you have x or y fear and then how it really is (nobody is even noticing you any more than they’re noticing anybody else).
Then you focus on soothing yourself out of that experience, maybe take a long shower.
Repeat until the anxiety shrinks down.",GAD
1025,"In my experience, they are all negative. I never have any positive hallucinations. Let me elaborate by telling you what I experience as a schizophrenic.
I hear demonic voices and experience tactile sensations of something clutching my right shoulder or I feel snakes crawl under me when I lie down. Sometimes, when I sit at my computer chair and lean back, I can feel something push into my back and roll back and forth. I also sense footsteps behind me as a demonic entity moves about me I can even feel or hear them.
I can feel it lean against the side of my seat cushion of my chair as I am typing this. I can also feel something move in my hair and am getting goosebumps on my arms and legs. It also just pushed into the back of my chair.
Just in the last couple of days, I also started seeing demonic faces flash in my mind. They are of a possessed woman with yellow eyes ringed with orange that with dark shadows around her eyes. She has black hair and her skin is white with a blue tint. There is some sort of crud and dirt on her face. She is filthy and has yellow teeth and is smiling a wide toothy grin at me. She looks like a thing of pure evil.
It reminds me of Reagan from The Exorcist but she looks completely different. I’ve never seen a movie with her in it before. I’m not afraid of it though. It just reminds me of an image from a horror movie.
They are just a quick flash of an image in my minds eye over my vision. I see it for an instant and then its gone. However, it happens multiple times per day. I’m getting goosebumps now as the demon is looking over my shoulder while I type. It says “what are you writing dumb ass? I told you I was a girl. You never believed me.”
Once, I saw it for a moment sitting on the couch looking at me. Another time, I also saw it walking along side of me mimicking my every move, walking back and forth while I was looking out the French doors to the backyard. I could see a reflection of it as an overlay in the glass from my mind’s eye. If that makes any sense? Basically, I knew I was looking out the French doors into the backyard. I did not actually see a reflection. Instead, my mind created a mental picture that was an overlay on my actual vision of the demonic girl following my every move. I knew I was not seeing her in the glass. She was appearing in my mind’s eye.
It keeps telling me to sell my soul or it says stuff in the first person making it sound like I’m selling my soul but KNOW that I AM NOT doing it. Its trying to trick me into making me think that its my thoughts except I KNOW that I am NOT ACTIVELY THINKING IT. I won't fall for its lies or tricks.
Each time it does it, I tell it “no” or “never.” I even cuss it out by telling it to “f%ck off!” I also quote the bible “what good is it to gain the world if you forfeit your soul.” However, it just says it again sometimes a few minutes later or even as short as 30 seconds later. Nothing stops it.
Once, it even caused pain in my left ear after it said it and I did not respond right away. It was like having something stab my eardrum. Then I said “never” and prayed “please God help me” and the pain stopped.
Thinking back to when I first came down with schizophrenia in November of 2017, the voice that I hear blasphemes God, the trinity of Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. It even commits the Unpardonable Sin ""whoever blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not have forgiveness in this world or the next.""
When it says it, I would shake my head and try to think of something different to stop it but I can't. I hear what it says regardless. However, it would also show me images of words in a book that I was trying to block out from hearing too. Basically, it would show me words to spell out what it was saying too. So I guess I have been having visual hallucinations but didn't really realize it.
Come to think of it, when this demonic presence first revealed itself to me by sitting down next to me on a couch that I was sitting in, it laughed and showed me images of a man from the 70's around a campfire with other people wearing clothes from that time period. It told me it was in him before but it drove him to commit suicide and laughed about it.
However, now that its showing images of a possessed woman, I realize that I am getting visual hallucinations as well.
Its not helpful at all. Its a creature of pure evil.
I won't fall for its tricks. I'm too smart for that. Plus, God is helping me in my battle against it. God must be helping me because I am not losing my shit over this. I'm handling this without medication. I have to, because anti-psychotics don’t work for me so I stopped taking them.
Instead, I choose to ignore my symptoms to the best of my ability but post about them on Quora to try and help people living with schizophrenia.
If anyone has any positive experiences from their case of schizophrenia, I would like to know. Please comment and tell me about your experiences. Be it positive or negative. I would like to know. Thanks!",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1027,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

Hello
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two mental illnesses associated with psychosis, but severe anxiety can trigger it as well. Some people who suffer from severe anxiety and have panic attacks or anxiety attacks as a result experience symptoms of psychosis.
The possible symptoms of psychosis includes, delusions, hallucinations, talking incoherently and agitation. The person with this condition is usually not aware of their behaviour.
So yes, anxiety can make you hallucinate. The medical treatment for this is antipsychotics and talk therapy.
All the best.",GAD
1029,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1030,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1032,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
1033,"Very hard to know if generalized anxiety disorder can be learned. I have my doubts. But this is what helicopter parenting does.
A child who has overprotective parents will not learn to trust themselves. They may struggle in life learning how to be independent when perhaps it is better learned in early teenage years. They learn distorted fears from their parents. Catastrophic thinking in the parents is adopted by the kid through just trying to be like their parents. All kids try to be like their parents except where there is pain in doing so. Then they want to be the opposite of the parents. Parents in general expect their kids to “be” like them. This is so dumb. An offspring of two parents will be a unique individual. Their inability to “be” what their parents instruct? Results in feelings of inadequacy. And loss of self worth. Leave them alone. Let them do things for themselves instead of solving all their needs for them by guesswork. They know everything the need to know almost by 12 these days. All the lecturing you put into “teaching”? It is natural for them to ignore you when they start puberty. You are wasting your breath. Let your kid be unique in the way they want to be. Not the way you want them to be. Accept as is. As long as you have taught morals and good choices vs bad? They can figure alot our on their own. Give them some trust so they feel capable of doing it on their own. Mommy and daddy may still be around at 18, but their work is done quite earlier than they realize.",GAD
1034,"Yes. Here’s how it works. Anxiety generally leads to avoidance. So if you’re scared of failing at your job, you’ll avoid your job. Avoidance leads to self guilt. So now you’re upset at yourself for failing to do your job. Self-guilt reinforces the anxiety. Because now the the thing you’re afraid of is scarier than it was before. Now, you’re afraid of your job and you hate yourself for it. This goes in a downwards cycle of anxiety and self-guilt until you end up both terrified and filled with self-loathing.",GAD
1035,"The definition of a hallucination is an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present. The definition of an illusion is a wrong or misinterpreted perception of a sensory experience. The common experiencing of oscillopsia (a Greek word for wavy vision) of stationary objects moving about seen in panic attacks and some people with PTSD is an hallucinatory apparent perception of movement that isn’t there or could be an illusionary visual misperception of something that is stationary. Otherwise an appearance of the image of a recently passed away loved one could be either, and be anxiety-related.
Since nothing is never and nothing is always, anxiety-caused visual hallucinations in the usual meaning of the word are very rare.",GAD

For example, when you are alone at the end of the day and trying to rest and relax. But you can't. Your mind is bombarded with thoughts. You might go over all the major decisions in your life and feel you were wrong. Maybe you start thinking that you are a phony and people are wrong to think you are good. The point is that the thoughts keep coming. Maybe you think of mistakes you've made and feel guilty about them. Depression causes the thoughts. The thoughts cause anxiety. You can't get to sleep, and the thoughts keep coming. Then when you do fall apart asleep you wake up a couple hours early and the thoughts start again. It is easy to believe that you can hear your thoughts. Anxiety and depression (they go hand in hand) can be terribly debilitating.",GAD

1039,"I believe that it’s entirely possible. In many cases, it can be the result of being over-reactive, of being hyper-vigilant. We are bathed in stimuli much of the time, but usually our executive functions serve a gatekeeping role, and we unconsciously screen out non-essential or insignificant signals. With anxiety and depression, the fight-or-flight mechanism can be triggered, and you are overly-sensitized, even filling in the gaps yourself to project indicators of what you fear or dread. Actual auditory stimuli can also be amplified out of proportion. During the height of my anxiety, when the phone rang or a buzzer sounded, you’d practically have to peel me off the ceiling. The mind can be quite a trickster…",GAD
1040,"I’m not schizophrenia nor am I a doctor or anything like that. I have had people close to me share their experiences. I personally haven’t known anyone to have generally or mostly positive experiences - many have told me about tormenting voices and horrible visions. Some also tell me about feeling the voices are “friends” and that they wouldn’t want to live without them. Whether that’s because they are positive or not I can’t say. I know some who refuse to take medications because they feel they aren’t themselves on meds. And because they feel they lose things like their creativity when on medications. To the outside world that sometimes doesn’t make sense to see someone who isn’t able to work or even homeless , who chooses not to take medications that could help them function in life for “creativity” or to “feel like themselves” but I can understand the feeling a little. To a much much lesser extent I have felt the times in my life I was severely depressed I was most creative and that the anti depressants made me feel like a zombie. Of course that doesn’t mean depression is good or positive. Just that the treatment had some effects that weren’t positive as well as some helpful ones. We can’t know what it is to live in someone else’s mind or to know why they choose to live with an illness. I know some people say the illness warps thinking and they aren’t capable of making a “sane” choice about medications etc. I don’t believe that. I also don’t believe the Illness is good - I’ve seen a lot of struggle and suffering for the person and their loved ones. Just because the person would choose not to take meds doesn’t mean the Illness is a good thing or positive thing. Just it’s preferable to that persons mind to be unmedicated and keep some of the delusion. I have also very sadly worked with a few patients years ago who were medicated against their wishes (determined by a doctor they weren’t able to make the choice for themself) and who went on to attempt or commit suicide because living without the voices or hallucinations was unbearable. They had lived life a certain way for years and suddenly were expected to adjust to a “normal” way a mind functions and of course that was a huge shock and too much for some. That doesn’t mean the illness was good. Some of these patients were tormented by horrible hallucinations and beliefs their family and loved ones were trying to kill them. They merely needed more help to adjust and cope and learn to live without the hallucinations and other things they had always known.
But back to the question I haven’t seen anyone who has mostly positive hallucinations. Doesn’t mean they aren’t out there it’s just not something I have seen. I have seen some patients /friends who have described positive experiences but always negative ones too. And some who describe something as positive - a “friend” for example in their head who tells them the family is trying to kill them and they are the only one to trust. To the person this “friend” is a life saver someone to trust and always there for them. To the people around that person the voice is driving them away from loved ones and isolating them , cutting off ties with family and encouraging them not to get help.
So each persons perception of a positive thing is different and I suppose to the outside it’s easy to say their perception is right and the persons mind is sick and getting help and or medications and taking away that voice and others is a good thing so the person can reunite with family and loved ones and function and get a job and have a family etc. but for the person - the only one who knows the experience in their own mind - those things might not seem good at all and the idea of living without that friend/voice might be too much. That’s not to say they shouldn’t get help. Many people do get help and are glad they did so and can look back and see things in a different way. I used to believe treatment was best always and that people with an illness couldn’t make a good choice for themselves. Now I don’t know. Of course the illness can be horrible and l have seen people on the streets who can’t function at all and have cut ties with their family and friends and seem to be living a sad existence. But I also see some who can’t seem to cope with reality and thinking in a Normal way to the point they attempt suicide. So for each person it’s different and the balance between the Illness and quality of life is different (provided they aren’t hurting themselves or others). I suppose you could Argue people do hurt themselves in things like refusing meds and cutting off their family and ending up on the streets. And each person is different and copes differently with Illness and what’s right for one person may not be for another.
In short I think (just my opinion as a person who hasn’t experienced the illness ) that what’s “positive “ or “good” is subjective. And while I don’t doubt there are some positive experiences or experiences that seem positive to the person , I know I also have seen a lot of negativity and torment and that seems to prevail more than anything positive. The more people I meet with the Illness the more confused I become about it as I see everyone’s journey is very different to the next person. I’m sure someone can give a more clinical answer or one from experience . But in general I think it’s far too complex to think of as mostly a good or bad thing. And what’s good or bad is so subjective. But yes I know people who refuse to take medications despite the illness impacting their ability to function , because for them the hallucinations and voices are better than the way they feel on medications.",GAD

1042,"Really, in all honesty, I don't think “”we"" can tell the difference. The reason why I say “we"" is that I've had the same questions for myself. I ended up going to see a psyc. doctor, because I felt that what I was seeing wasn't logical. It didn't make sense to me so I went to the doctor and he gave me some pills and they helped , somewhat. Than I took it all to God and asked for his help and he gave it to me completely.
What I was seeing and hearing , I believe to be demons. I thought it then and I think it now. What I can tell you about my experience is that the doctor did help me to clear up my brain a bit ,but took the power of God to make it all go away
Maybe you should try both to. It's not gonna hurt to see a doctor but praying is also helpful. All I know is that when I told my doctor that I was seeing demons he immediately prescribed prozac and when I told him that I wasn't seeing any more hallucinations and that I was off the prozac he figured that I was feeling better so I took my self off and that he believed that I would go back to seeing things again,but I didn't. He asked me why I thought that they weren't coming back,I told him because God was helping me. He laughed that off and tried to get me back on meds . Later on he would end up saying that it was all in my imagination .
It's all hard to say, but I know that I'ma believer. I believe God could remove my demons and he did. So was it my imagination? Or was it the power of God?I guess we all need to answer that question ourselves, but for the time being an office visit wouldn't hurt you , as no one wants to be responsible for the hurting of another
. There maybe medical reasons for your hallucinations and seeing a doctor could save your life or the life of somebody else . All I'm saying is try a doctor to make sure you are safe, but do not forget to go to God as well. I hope that you are relieved from these hallucinations as I know how terrifying they can be.",GAD
1043,"By getting counselling while at university (because it’s often free at these places).
And within the sessions, I opened up about some really deep stuff that I doubt many people would have gone through only to realise that for the most part I was fine and wasn't going crazy.
I haven't had very much anxiety for 9 months now and I doubt it will develop again. But through having major anxiety and depression of various forms to becoming mentally stable again i have realised that there's mostly an issue with the thought process in how you go about thinking about things.
It sounds kind of obvious to those with it but it’s quite a major issue when you programme yourself to think in a manner where you’re almost always thinking way too much about something and very deeply which can bring up certain things that may frighten you and because of that I ended up searching on the internet using loaded questions that were sort of creating these self-fulfilling prophecies about worse case scenarios that you think are going to happen or are happening to you and that everyone else is too stupid to think about it in enough detail to realise that there's something wrong.
It may sound stupid to people with the anxiety disorders at first or you may realise it but not give it enough credit but you do over think things way too much and way too often. Not vice vera.
And it’s weird because you get these thought processes that trick yourself (almost unconsciously) into rooting out potential problems within your life and within yourself and inflate the probability of it happening just because the threat could potentially exist even though the chances of it happening are quite often so minute it's negligible.
My main advice would be (from 5/6 years of personal experience of previously having it)
Seek counselling (it’s the best thing I ever did) and actually talk about the problem no matter how ridiculous it sounds or if it makes you teary because they really are used to and trained with handling this sort of thing.
Acknowledge that the anxiety is coming from within the disorder itself and not the things you are anxious about, therefore you be looking into other peoples experiences of anxiety, realise the restrictive thought processes of what you got through that makes you anxious, how they got better and etc rather than assuming the thing you are anxious about is the cause.
Quit caffeine (or at least reduce it) this might sound ridiculous but for myself and others, caffeine really does induce or at least exacerbate anxiety mentally and physiologically for that reason it’s best to reduce it until you’re better. It doesn't necessarily get rid of the anxiety disorder but it does help in managing the anxiety.
Don’t be afraid to start thinking differently (by challenging and not following through with the anxious behaviour) in a way that breaks the anxious thought loops. It sounds ridiculous but the anxious thought patterns feel normal and almost addictive and to think otherwise can seem scary or dangerous when that's simply not the case realistically.",GAD
1044,"Anxiety is a natural body reaction as a protection us from danger.
GAD is when that stress reaction gets turned on and stays on chronically, rather than the usual stress reaction of see a bear, run away, get to safety, relax.

1045,"The most important trick is to avoid getting anxious about the hallucinations themselves. If they can be understood as just your mind’s response to anxiety or maybe a visual representation of what your mind is anxious about, then you can see they are not a threat and you don’t need to be scared of them.
When we get anxious about being anxious, or about the way anxiety makes our body feel, or in this case about the way anxiety makes us see visions, then the anxiety just spirals, it becomes a vicious circle.
It’s very different when the hallucination is just seen as a sign that we are anxious. Then we might just be kind to ourselves, accept the way we are feeling, and maybe take action to lower our stress level or to make ourselves safer if there is something unsafe about our current situation.",GAD
1046,"There is some evidence that neurofeedback can be an effective treatment for panic and anxiety. Neurofeedback is a type of biofeedback that uses real-time displays of brain activity to teach individuals how to self-regulate their brain function. It is based on the principle that individuals can learn to control their brain activity and thus improve their symptoms.
Several studies have found that neurofeedback can be effective in reducing symptoms of panic and anxiety. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis of 17 studies found that neurofeedback was associated with significant reductions in anxiety symptoms. Another study published in 2018 found that neurofeedback was effective in reducing both anxiety and depression symptoms in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder.
However, more research is needed to fully understand the effectiveness of neurofeedback for panic and anxiety. It is important to note that neurofeedback is not a standalone treatment and is often used in combination with other therapies, such as medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy. It is also important to work with a trained and experienced neurofeedback practitioner to ensure proper treatment and monitoring.

It can be used for organic brain disorders, such as autism, cerebral palsy, seizures, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. It can also be helpful for people who struggle with drug and alcohol addiction and conditions like mood swings and PMS.",GAD

1054,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD

1056,"Very effective in my experience.
I struggled with depression and anxiety for years. I used to take up to 4 medications to deal with it all. It was ridiculous.
I now don’t suffer from either depression and anxiety. I’m very healthy mentally.
And neurofeedback played a key role in my recovery.
Our brainwaves fall into five distinct “bandwidths” depending on their frequency - delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) research shows that some people have excessively high or excessively low levels of brain activity in one or more of these bandwidths, leading to mental and behavioural abnormalities.
Neurofeedback (also known as EEG biofeedback) is an advanced training technique that provides real-time information about your own EEG activity.
It enables people to develop and strengthen healthier brainwave patterns and rewire the electrical functioning of the brain over time.
In my case, certain parts of my brain made either too many or too few brainwaves that were too fast or too slow, and this manifested itself in the world as depressive, anxious behavior and inattention. It was also discovered that my amygdala – the fear centre of my brain – was overactive, which correlates with chronic anxiety and depression.
By looking at my results, my neurofeedback practitioner accurately described many of the mental symptoms that I had struggled with since my concussions in 2010. I was shocked by the accuracy of her insights. She was the first doctor who I felt actually understood and could precisely define my symptoms. And so I thought that she might actually be the first doctor to get to the bottom of the lingering problems that I haven’t been able to overcome by myself. No one had ever gotten to the root cause of my persistent symptoms, and it appeared that I was pursuing something that might actually work.
My depression and anxiety has always been deep and constant. But within my first five sessions, I noticed I felt a lot better. I’m now calmer. I have more energy. I have better concentration. I’m more motivated to get things done. I’m smarter and more creative. I’m consistently happy about life. I’m not struggling or stuck. I’m off all medications (at my worst, I was on 4). I still experience stress and anxiety like any human being, but it doesn’t rule my life. I’m functioning like a healthy, balanced person. I’ve become a different and better person because of it. And it’s become a permanent part of who I am.
I know this sounds too good to be true. but here is some research:

1057,"My first job was as a part-time cashier at a supermarket.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but I have sensory issues. Of all the emotional pain I’ve dealt with in my life, nothing compares to sensory overload. You know the trash compactor scene in Star Wars? It’s like that. Like the walls are closing in on all sides, mountains of things building up and slowly crushing you to death. There is no way to escape and no one to hear you scream, nothing to do but wait for the inevitable moment when the pain reaches unbearable levels and the last breath is squeezed from your lungs.
I was barely functioning. I couldn’t count out change, I couldn’t follow instructions with more than one step, I couldn’t understand what people were saying when they were talking to me. I couldn’t think.
But I was supposed to learn quickly, follow instructions immediately, remember a plethora of unwritten rules, make small talk with customers, answer questions, comply with customer requests, memorize produce codes, count out change.
And smile as I did it.
For up to six hours.
(Also, side note, if your cashier doesn’t smile and say hello when you enter the line, that doesn’t mean she is “rude and disrespectful” or “not trying” or “ungrateful for her job” or “exactly what’s wrong with this generation”. Maybe she’s suffering from severe anxiety and she literally cannot speak. Please, please, have compassion.)
The only way I could do anything was complete mental shutdown. I was told at least once per shift that I looked depressed, I had difficulty putting things into bags because I was so dissociated I couldn’t tell where my hands were, but I could breathe. I could barely understand English, but I could breathe.
I thought that was normal.
I tried to tell my parents about it, but I assumed they knew the emotions I felt. To them, it was just complaining. So I was treated to talks from parents and grandparents about all the worst jobs they’d ever had and how they were so much worse than mine and life is work, and what I learned was that life is a contest to see who can bear the most pain without letting anyone see, and if I spent a single moment not in agony that meant I was lazy.
I learned not to confide in anyone. I learned to suppress my anxiety attacks until I was alone. I did not learn how to calm down from them.
The anxiety attacks began to happen outside of work more and more often. I was constantly on the verge of one. The twenty-four hours surrounding each shift were complete panic.
To cope, I completely blocked my job out of my mind. I shut off any and all thoughts related to it, I told myself that the hours I worked didn’t exist. I was left with only a vague feeling of dread.
After over a year, I quit my job.
But the dread persisted. It wasn’t connected to my job anymore—I had so completely removed my job from my mind that I no longer remembered it as the source of my anxiety. Life was the reason I was anxious. Life was hard, life was pain, if it was bearable I was doing it wrong.
My problems were invalid because my life was too good. I didn’t have problems, I was just lazy and weak.
I suspect these are not the “life lessons” my parents had wanted me to learn when they drove me to the supermarket to fill out an application.
Though that was a while ago, I still have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I’m still constantly anxious, worried that I’m doing something wrong or something bad is going to happen. The dread is a self-fulfilling prophecy: something bad happens eventually, and then it’s proven right. My triggers have changed, but the anxiety is still there.
I’m working on it. I understand now where the dread came from, and I understand that the negative messages I received from the adults in my life were due to miscommunication on my part.
I feel a bit embarrassed that my anxiety disorder was caused by such a minor thing as a part-time job… but I know that’s my anxiety talking, and my mental health issues are still valid. It has taken me a long time to accept that.",GAD
1058,"Yes! But the setting has to be realistic: You need a list of social situations sortet by subjective stress-ratings, for example:
1 = sitting in a park next to a stranger
2 = standing in a crowd of people waiting for the bus
3 = attending a soccer game alone
4 = asking a stranger for direction
and so on
10 = the client’s most feared social situation
You will need an hour for this preparation. Take your time, it’s already part of the solution.
Then you describe the first situation (the easiest one) and your client has to relax.
Here I use biofeedback with smart-lights that change colors:
red = stressful, green = relaxed
I describe the situation (or show a video) and repeat each stage until my client acutally has fun in a former stressful situation:
We continue this training level by level until my client has “won” his final stage (gamification).

1059,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..

Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed

1061,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
1062,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.

It also teaches the individual how to control the brain's activity and maintain the proper brainwave levels to achieve a calm and focused state.

The attacks themselves feature the usual heart racing (which doesn't bother me much, you can think your way out of this one a bit), feeling of impending death, saturating sweat, extreme thirst, freezing and hot back and forth, distorted vision, crippling leg cramps etc. They usually start when I'm sleeping, and sometimes when stressors are paradoxically low.

Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.

Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings.

FEATURES of the NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY will stick out like a huge FLAMING RED SORE THUMB.
PERSONALITY DISORDERS, itself, doesn't exist in a vacuum nor monolith. There are subtypes and subsets according to specificity….. For, instance, CLUSTER-A personality is: socially isolated, withdrawn, odd with eccentricities, paranoid, and suspicious. CLUSTER-B personality is: impulsive, emotionally unstable/intense, sexually provocative/exhibitionistic, self-absorbed, egocentristic, materialistic, prone to self-harm, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type, violent, dangerous, and sadistic. CLUSTER-C personality is: anxious, withdrawn, dependant, avoidiant, and hyper perfectionism. Neither does NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER personality disorder.
CLUSTER-B’s are: NPD, HPD, BPD, and ASPD.
Features of the NPD are: extremely cocky, arrogant, hubristic, EXAGGERATED PRIDEFULNESS, self-absorbed, self-centered, and egocentristic…. Likewise, they can be cunning, DECEPTIVE, manipulative, devious, insidious, backstabbing, cynical, pathological liars, sadistic, violent, and dangerous. They can be a benign flicker of flame or an HUMONGOUS atomic explosion. SUBTYPES: are grandiose, exhibitionist, covert, philanthropic, cerebral or malignant……. THOUGH be more concerned with the covert and malignant types.
The grandiose, overt, philanthropic NPD commands to be the center of attention, they are the geocentric cogs of the universe. FYI, they will lie, cheat, and steal the spotlight, by undercutting or a concocted deviously plot against rival. Watch “ROSEMARY'S BABY”, the antagonist of this movie made a pack with the Devil to eliminate his competition for top/lead role in a film. Deviously cunning he served up/sacrificed his unsuspecting wife to clinch the deal. Typically typical of a grandiose narcissistic personality to invade someone's boundary, deviously plot behind their back, and selfishly sacrifice that individual for ITS self-aggrandizement….
They are a recognition HOG in regards to everything or anything they do, want or accomplish. If they are philanthropic, they must be constantly applauded or given a posthumous title which highlights their contributions. Whatever nickel, dime, quarter or dollar they give must be televised for the recognition. Put their name and contributions in historical reference.….therefore they will never be forgotten. HEY, erect a wing in their honor, a park bench, an Honorary Doctorate or a picture in a library, city hall, etc….etc…..
REMEMBER, THEY ain't giving from the goodness of their heart, BUT to stroke their ego... They are the ones that broadcast how much they give every time they make a donation to a worthy cause, i.e. famine relief, stop world hungry, and help struggling third world countries, etc…
Therefore, PHILANTHROPIC NARCISSIST like BILL COSBY didn't give based on any legitimate empathetic selfless reason. He gave to be rewarded with posthumous praises and watch sycophants genuflect when he entered a room……He gave to receive endless gratitude, and to be worshiped and adored…… SING his accomplishments. But never forget behind that grandiose, exhibitionistic self-aggrandizement, is a fearful, fragile self-esteem/ego, a false-self trying to blend. The narcissistic personality will go through phases of idealization, devaluation, and discard…. KINGS and QUEENS of gaslighting, triangulation, vilification, dehumanization, and parasitism.
THEY WILL SHOW SYMPTOMS….
HOWEVER, WILL NEVER ADMIT ANYTHING IS WRONG WITH THEM…..
There is NEVER anything wrong with them, but EVERYTHING is wrong with you….
THEIR pathological LIES are your LIES
YOUR TRUTHS, ACCOMPLISHMENTS, DREAMS, AND ASPIRATIONS ARE THEIRS.
Everything you accomplished was never YOURS, but theirs……YOUR strengths, wisdom, endurance, and perseverance IS THEIRS.
Only a CRUMB of a FEW will seek professional help, but usually for something else. THEY will steal your ideas, artistic brilliance, and intellectual girth as their own property.

1074,"to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder means that there is a significant disruption to your everyday life due to anxiety and its symptoms.
Anxiety can look like a lot of things, such as:
Avoiding leaving the house
Wearing multiple layers in the summertime so people don’t see you sweating so much
Not going out to eat because you believe people are watching you eat
Sudden and intense feelings of fear and panic—-feeling like you’re unable to breathe or your heart feels like it’s going to beat out of your chest.
Avoiding important tasks
Irrational fears—you can even acknowledge that it’s irrational, however, physical symptoms can keep you from changing your mind.
irritability is also a good example.. if you are in an uncomfortable situation and lash out at the people around you, this is usually anxiety coming out as frustration or anger.
There are multiple sub-types of anxiety, which will manifest differently in everyone. If you are unable to complete tasks that may be considered “normal” to other people due to worrisome thoughts or to avoid certain uncomfortable physical symptoms, you should talk with your PCP.",GAD
1075,"I have 3 intertwining anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, and Derealization/Depersonalization), so my symptoms often overlap and feed into each other. Also, physical and psychological symptoms often go together, but I will try to narrow them down to be more specific. These are some of my psychological symptoms:
Overthinking (worrying about the past/future). I can’t stop thinking about things that worry me and I will over-analyze an event, moment, or comment to the point of even having an anxiety attack.
“Fortune-telling” (worrying about the future). This symptom is what happens when you start imagining all the bad things that could happen and goes along with overthinking. It usually happens before I go out or meet with friends. At my worst, my thinking could get so negative that I find myself not going places because of this.
Feeling extremely irritable, angry, restless. I can usually tell when my anxiety is acting up when I feel uncomfortable for “no reason”, (but the reason is that I have anxiety). When I’m like this, it’s easier for me to get overwhelmed and I often have the need to withdraw from socializing.
Feeling “on edge” or jumpy, getting scared easily.
“Automatic thinking”. Most of the psychological symptoms stem from “automatic thoughts,” which are negative thoughts or assumptions that quickly pop-up in your mind and leave you with a severe feeling of dread or make you apprehensive to do things.
Lack of concentration. Not being able to understand people/things around you because you have so much going on in your mind.
These are a few that I could think of. Although it’s really hard to deal with all aspects of anxiety, what makes it harder is when the physical symptoms accompany the psychological ones. So you don’t only think certain things, but you feel certain ways when you think them.
I hope this helped.",GAD
1076,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)

I overthink. I think of many things and I am prone to think about past and future, and I am usually very sad when I think of past, and for future-well I try to control it in terms that I try to avoid some possible obstacles and perceived dangers (even if danger is barely possible)
I think of death too much, and what is going on after death
I am restless and fidgety and I cant sit on one spot, and I need to take a walk often.
I have health concerns, even that I am most likely healthy.
I feel sorrow, especially for the past
I lost interest in things I used to enjoy (this also can be depression and not simply GAD)
I dont have will to socialize as I used to have.
I am constantly worried about many things.
I can become angry and I have problem controlling it.
I have a feeling of impending doom, like all will vanish or be destroyed, and that nothing positive is going to happen.
Lack of concentration.
Feeling of lump in the throat, difficulty swallowing sometimes.
Difficulty breathing (especially shortness of breathe).
Stomach problems and pain.
I used to have palpitations, but not anymore.",GAD
1080,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1081,"if you do have post traumatic stress you will always have anxiety. Neurosis is legitimate suffering according to Carl Jung. Anxiety is signaling that there’s something inside ourselves that needs attention mainly pain. Post traumatic stress isesentiwlly the freeze response (codependency). When in the presence of someone your parasympathetic kicks in an you play possum when around people. The person feels completely helpless and filled with terror. The first thing to do is to change your cognition and repeat to yourself that the world is safe and people are safe. Once you do that your nervous system will calm down and will stop firing the freeze response. You will eventually start feeling more comfortable around people and will stop scanning them looking for the slightest sign of disapproval. Learn that safety is not out there is inside ourselves. We can make ourselves feel safe. Envision your adult self comforting the little scare kid inside. Learn to surrender control and get used to dealing with vulnerability. The more tense you are the more that nervous system will think you are in danger. Relax, drop control and observe , never react. You are safe it is just a feeling.",GAD
1082,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread

His mask could fool anyone. if you know what to look for in narcisstic behavior then you will see the signs clearly, because they are all the same. The key is to trust your instincts. Whenever you feel there may be something “off” don’t push it aside, and give the benefit of the doubt. If you feel there is something wrong, your probably right. I believe in 40 years I was the only one with balls enough to expose my ex Narc even at risk of losing everything.

1084,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

Think about why did your first panic attack or why did you felt so uncomfortable? That is your factor.
YOU CAN BEAT IT.

1086,"Yes. Mine used to come seemingly out of nowhere. I’d be in traffic and all of the sudden here one comes. I’d be waiting in line at Walmart and one would come on and I’d have to leave. Elevators were a big NO. I’d be talking to someone and one would come on. Now that I’m properly medicated I can fight them. I still feel them coming on but they go away. I figured out my triggers were not being able to leave a situation. So I talk myself down BEFORE I get into one. Some catch me off guard, like seeing someone on the market who wants to talk but now I can handle that. So yes they can come out of nowhere but with therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) and/or meditation they are manageable.",GAD
1087,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1088,"Starting at age 5:
Hyperventilating in stressful situations
Facial twitches
Being so tense in my sleep that I’d pull muscles
Having lucid dreams of being tortured to death when under stress
Panic Attacks
Obsessive negative self talk
Things I didn’t realize until adulthood because to me, it never existed (if you don’t realise these are possible, maybe you should see a therapist):
You can think about nothing.
You can relax and enjoy the moment.
You can make it days without holding tension. (I physically feel lighter without anxiety).
People wake up NOT feeling nervous, and can make it whole days without feeling like ninjas are going to bust out of a closet and attack.
Luckily for me, I have been using neurofeedback for about 5 weeks now, and it has opened my eyes to how life actually is.",GAD
1089,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1090,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1091,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1094,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD.

1096,"Yes, in a nutshell, generalized anxiety is longer-lasting throughout and does not have as severe anxiety as someone with panic disorder throughout the day, when it is active. The person worries excessively about several things, that most people wouldn’t. This can result in body aches, not being able to sleep, and problems with concentration. Some people do have panic attacks along with generalized disorder but most do not. It can result in trouble at school or work, daily activities, and it feels miserable to have.
Panic attacks are part of anxiety disorder, just because someone has a panic attack does not mean they have panic disorder. A person with a panic attack can have one that seems to come out of nowhere or it can be a result of being exposed to something similar to which they had their last panic attack. A panic attack is supposed to last 15–20 minutes but varies per person. The person feels extreme fear and sometimes like they are going crazy or are doomed. They usually have four or more symptoms like shivering, rapid heartbeat, chest constriction, feeling like they can’t breathe, numb or tingling arms and fingers, etc. They also can have feelings of depersonalization or derealization. The feeling often feels like how one would feel if they were hiding under the bed and a murderer meant to do them harm is in the room looking for them.
Panic disorder happens because the attacks feel so terrible that people fear having them again. You did not ask for a description. On both of the disorders, medical causes and medications causing the problem have to be ruled out before a diagnosis is given.",GAD

1098,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
1099,"Hi there,
Yes, the mind (read: brain) is such a powerful thing, you can bring on that panic-attack easily when you got the right situation (high fear and anxiety).
Nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it.
But it’s not good, of course.
By creating seriously stressful situations you let your thoughts and feelings get out of control, while actually it should be you that must change ‘the situation’ so that you’re IN CONTROL > and so that you can reduce the stress to a ‘normal level’ where you can handle it.
Know that it’s all a Learning Experience. Whatever hits you happens and it’s up to you to Place that experience in your Past so that you can move on with your daily Life purpose, which is actually very simple: YOU.TODAY.HAPPY.
Those stressful experiences that you got MUST be avoided/stopped/reduced/end/deleted.
Of course Life always happens where others impact you and give you stress, but no matter what; you must stay IN CONTROL.
You have your Control when you enjoy your day 85% of the Time, and then you got 15% of the day where others can impact you (with stress).
When you got your daily 85% happiness > you ARE in Control. It is your Reward and you become Strong, Confident and Empowered in your ToDay.
So that’s how you get there when you have the right Concept of your Life > as you can read (and use) in your daily Life in this simplified post:
It’s all about how YOUR Life works for you.
Don’t become a copy of others because of the culture you are in, because you will only end up disappointed, sad, broken-inside, lost and insecure (all at the same time all-of-the-time).
Instead you “work” to get to your daily Happiness so that you get your Reward (you being in Control, most-of-the-time).
LOVE yourself.
An important part of your happiness/success in your Life is when you use a ‘trick’, which is actually you listening to your own inner self. It’s how you use and listen to your instinct and intuition.
It’s a feature thats already inside of you, so when you learn how to use it: EVERY choice/decision you make is a successful one. It automatically STOPS you from OVERthinking, thus reducing/minimising your anxiety and fear.
How good is that ?!!!
It’s simple, just read up on it here and check out the targeted video too:
use it with every choice that you have to make, and YOU FINE!
Learn to use it.
The OVERthinking (resulting in your Fear and anxiety) mentioned above can be easily solved when you do MEDITATION; daily 30 minutes. But doing it a few times is not enough > Meditate for 30 days and by that time you’ll be more healthy in Mind and body.
For whatever/whoever gives you that stress > you do FORGIVENESS as mentioned in this post:
Of course your Live is BiG, so I can’t mention everything here, but it’s a summary of the key topics that are your Start for your own GOODness Lifestyle.
More GOODness Mindset and Perspective ’stuff’ that’s gonna guide you on your way you’ll find in my Quora Spaces page > it’s all there for you, just see which posts are good for you.

1100,"I have not actually!
Having experienced these for a decade now, you’d think I could say I’m the poster child for a cure- but after three therapists, multiple medications, and mental breakdowns/slumps, I can tell you I’m alive to tell the tale!
In my earliest years with the two , I felt such pain and discomfort with existing. Sometimes it can feel suffocating, and make relaxing nonexistent. It’s the level of pain and physical stress I wouldn’t wish upon anyone seeing it is difficult and sometimes trial and error to cure.
I’ve tried medications (I am currently on Prozac) and even antianxiety medications- which, didn’t do what I personally envisioned- but they do help some people so there’s no loss in hope!
My favorite coping methods to date have been:
being warm- my bed is a bonus- I feel safest there
Being in a bathroom- private ideally. In case I get too anxious to the point of vomiting, I can clean up and not stress about others worrying about me
Getting a tight hug
Closing my eyes
No noise or minimal noise (headphones help)
Squeezing a stress ball (I get fidgety)
Drinking water and going out for fresh air
Panic attacks are dizzying for me, so I tend to sit down or lay down if able. It would make me lose my breath and get stressed out, so I would try to minimize activity or demands on my body.
Anxiety isn’t easy, neither are panic attacks, but you learn to feel it coming- acknowledge it, and stop it in its tracks. It comes, but because I know what works for me, I won’t let it get severely awful and I make sure to remember my coping skills.
There’s a lot of things to try, even scents to smell when it erupts- but it’s a matter of personal trial and error. I live with the two everyday, and it’s not always present on the surface, but I know it’s dormant and I’m ready for it when it comes.",GAD

1103,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long. Just annoyed and upset, and that’s perfectly fine!",GAD
1104,"I have panic disorder. I think at its most literal definition, it's when panic attacks progress beyond normal and expected limits, they become a disorder.
More practically, for me, it means having one panic attack after another, for hours and hours until I'm so exhausted I basically pass out. The attacks themselves feature the usual heart racing (which doesn't bother me much, you can think your way out of this one a bit), feeling of impending death, saturating sweat, extreme thirst, freezing and hot back and forth, distorted vision, crippling leg cramps etc. They usually start when I'm sleeping, and sometimes when stressors are paradoxically low. I feel horrible the next day, with a sore throat, sore legs, fuzzy thinking, and a headache. Fortunately I saw a doctor and rarely have issues now. Anxiety is still there but panic marathons have mostly left the building.",GAD
1105,"There are many different reasons for panic attacks, but it is to fair to say that anxiety and panic attacks can be worsened by trying to avoid difficult thoughts, feelings, and sensations.
Anxiety is what is called “self-reinforcing.” Briefly, what that means is that when you encounter a difficult situation that causes you to feel anxiety (a normal human response that we all experience), if you then avoid that situation, your anxiety goes away! (At least for a little bit.) However, the next time that situation comes up, you now have the anxiety (I don’t want to do this) and the message that avoiding it makes the anxiety go away. So avoiding makes sense, right? If your goal is to not feel anxiety anymore in that moment. So you do it again, and the next time the situation comes up, the anxiety is even bigger, and because you want to avoid that anxiety, you get stuck in this loop where the anxiety is actually getting bigger and bigger but your mind has trained itself to think the only way to make the anxiety go away is by avoiding it.
Here’s an image from the Counseling Collective that is helpful in visualizing this process:
Basically, it’s a feedback loop. And at the extreme end, we can get so afraid of the thing that was making us anxious that it puts us basically into a fight-or-flight response (increased heart rate, rapid breathing, changes in blood flow, hearing loss, tunnel vision, sweating), but there’s no “actual” danger, so we have all of this energy in our nervous system but nowhere for it to go. Our system is sending us all kinds of mixed signals, and the fact that there’s no “real” danger actually makes the panic worse, because we associate the fear with the symptoms themselves rather than the thing that made us anxious in the first place. We’re anxious about our anxiety, basically.
So how do we break that cycle? A big part of it is dealing with the thing that you were avoiding in the first place. If you put all your phone bills in the drawer, you still have to pay them eventually, right? And it’d be a good idea to get some additional support, like from a therapist, while working on this.
In the case of panic disorder, you’ll need to work with a professional who can help you through the process of understanding your nervous system response, working to change it where you can, and the other aspects of treating panic disorder such as desensitization or exposure.",GAD
1106,"You need to get checked by some medical specialist. Then you can ask some people who have suffered and what are their opinions.
First, you need to confirm it's panic attack not any other physical illness. When I went through it, I could predict through anxiety brewing inside, feelings of increasing sadness and wishing to cry my heart out and it used to end with panic attack, i.e. breathlessness, crying in night.
Ultimately I contacted a psychiatrist, some medicines were advised I am taking these medicines, although with change or gap intermittently. I started taking medicines in 2012 and haven't experienced panic attacks except once when i stopped taking medicine. You don't seem suffering from anything else but i had a long history.
People talk about Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, but, I haven't experimented it because here in India that much time to patients isn't given and no medical practitioner prescribed it. However, check your physical well-being first. I suffered from intestinal worms too, a low grade fever was diagnosed as anxiety disorder taht ended with some other medicines.
After these all medicine I feel a lot better and more productive. Albeit, medicines for mental illness are being taken still.",GAD
1107,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD
1108,"Many people say genetics or traumatic experiences. My theory comes from the latter. To me, it’s a wrong programming of the brain, which can be reversed, by treatment that helps create new neural pathways. If you felt vulnerable during childhood, not safe, your brain is trained to see dangers everywhere. So, it becomes trained to react with anxiety to many situations. Physical abuse, bulling, and many others can create the basis for an anxiety disorder later in life. For adults, stressful situations over a long period of time can create the basis for a panic disorder. Uncertainties about the future, sickness, a divorce, unemployment with children and so forth.
Psychiatrists say that anxiety disorders are created by an imbalance of brain chemicals, so they prescribe pills to correct those imbalances. I firmly believe that it’s not like that. To me, anxiety create those chemical imbalances, not the other way around, and pills don’t resolve anything, just mask the symptons. When you drop the pills the anxiety comes back recharged. You need to discover the root of your anxiety and work these roots, pills don’t led to self discovery. Once you work on the root of your anxiety and get control over it, your brain chemicals balance themselves as you reprogram your brain.",GAD

When my brain is starting to roll like a hamster in his ball, my anxiety level begin to go up. Sometime there just no reason ! I think I have a brain that is overreacting sometime. My dad have the same illness. My aunt too, so it’s cleary biological in my case. But when I see that I become more anxious my negative thoughts is coming. So I give more anxiety on top of that haha. For example, in february I lost my uncle to cancer. Many month before, I was having really high anxiety because I was scare of (not to lost him because I know that the cancer was in his final state) but I was scare of my reaction after his death. I was scare to fall into a depression or extreme anxiety. Nothing happen ! I was crying something it’s normal but … I was anxious for nothing because I cope good with that. Brain is so weird !",GAD
1110,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1111,"The short answer is that science doesn't fully understand anxiety disorders, but it does know they are common, and involve brain and nervous system overreactions compared to the general population. We all are familiar with having an emotion continue beyond its useful time, such as loving long after breaking up, or being angry with someone months later than the event that set off the anger. Anxiety disorders have some of that flavor: your brain and related systems react as though you are being chased by a tiger even when there is no tiger. It may be that you have DNA making you more likely to have this overreaction than others, which, combined with your life experience, causes the reaction. Some people feel nausea, some dizziness, some shake, some sweat, some feel hopeless, some frozen, some uncommunicative, but you can see how it is related to the fear you or anyone might have to a mouse, or when a car is swerving toward you. But it doesn't have to have a trigger you can identify, although for some people it is triggered by a social experience or a pending one. Maybe normally you feel a slight tinge of anxiety about going out to a bar with friends; this is an exaggerated version of that feeling. Maybe for you it is vague what thought sets it off, maybe you know. Think of it like the different amounts people sweat at the same amount of jogging.
For most people anti-anxiety meds and cognitive behavior therapy, combined with relaxation techniques like breathing slowly or meditating help. The trick is to accept the feeling without judgement, try to put the annoying thought out of your mind and to focus on something else (like slow breathing), and let it slow down, reduce in intensity and pass.",GAD
1112,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

1114,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

For each person something different work.
Your first,is to acknowledge the triggers. The more you find out about your triggers, the better for you. I found that if you know the origin of your anxiety it's a fight half one.
Yhen you need to find what helps center your thoughts. That will be your second key to overcome anxiety.
This is unfortunately trial by error. You get people that can breath through an attack. Others find one spot on a wall to concentrate on. A person, moving your fingers, start singing in your favorite song in your head take off your shoes and ground yourself .all non self harming ways. Find your center.
Yes the good old elastic band in your wrist trick works. But unfortunately I have seen to many escalate from that to self harm because the band does not help anymore. So please be careful if you should choose this way.
The outcome will help you cope with things you found daunting before. But it's up to you your choice to make, are you going to try everything until you find the way that works for you

1117,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1118,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.

1120,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1121,"it is interesting that they don’t state that anxiety most likely comes from an insecure attachment. When you have fear of abandonment you are always anxious afraid that you are going to be left. Anxiety comes from being separated from your source of safety.

When you have been traumatized your fight or flight or on at all times. Anxiety disorders happen when you are completely avoiding your anxiety.

1125,"My first job was as a part-time cashier at a supermarket.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but I have sensory issues. Of all the emotional pain I’ve dealt with in my life, nothing compares to sensory overload. You know the trash compactor scene in Star Wars? It’s like that. Like the walls are closing in on all sides, mountains of things building up and slowly crushing you to death. There is no way to escape and no one to hear you scream, nothing to do but wait for the inevitable moment when the pain reaches unbearable levels and the last breath is squeezed from your lungs.
I was barely functioning. I couldn’t count out change, I couldn’t follow instructions with more than one step, I couldn’t understand what people were saying when they were talking to me. I couldn’t think.
But I was supposed to learn quickly, follow instructions immediately, remember a plethora of unwritten rules, make small talk with customers, answer questions, comply with customer requests, memorize produce codes, count out change.
And smile as I did it.
For up to six hours.
(Also, side note, if your cashier doesn’t smile and say hello when you enter the line, that doesn’t mean she is “rude and disrespectful” or “not trying” or “ungrateful for her job” or “exactly what’s wrong with this generation”. Maybe she’s suffering from severe anxiety and she literally cannot speak. Please, please, have compassion.)
The only way I could do anything was complete mental shutdown. I was told at least once per shift that I looked depressed, I had difficulty putting things into bags because I was so dissociated I couldn’t tell where my hands were, but I could breathe. I could barely understand English, but I could breathe.
I thought that was normal.
I tried to tell my parents about it, but I assumed they knew the emotions I felt. To them, it was just complaining. So I was treated to talks from parents and grandparents about all the worst jobs they’d ever had and how they were so much worse than mine and life is work, and what I learned was that life is a contest to see who can bear the most pain without letting anyone see, and if I spent a single moment not in agony that meant I was lazy.
I learned not to confide in anyone. I learned to suppress my anxiety attacks until I was alone. I did not learn how to calm down from them.
The anxiety attacks began to happen outside of work more and more often. I was constantly on the verge of one. The twenty-four hours surrounding each shift were complete panic.
To cope, I completely blocked my job out of my mind. I shut off any and all thoughts related to it, I told myself that the hours I worked didn’t exist. I was left with only a vague feeling of dread.
After over a year, I quit my job.
But the dread persisted. It wasn’t connected to my job anymore—I had so completely removed my job from my mind that I no longer remembered it as the source of my anxiety. Life was the reason I was anxious. Life was hard, life was pain, if it was bearable I was doing it wrong.
My problems were invalid because my life was too good. I didn’t have problems, I was just lazy and weak.
I suspect these are not the “life lessons” my parents had wanted me to learn when they drove me to the supermarket to fill out an application.
Though that was a while ago, I still have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I’m still constantly anxious, worried that I’m doing something wrong or something bad is going to happen. The dread is a self-fulfilling prophecy: something bad happens eventually, and then it’s proven right. My triggers have changed, but the anxiety is still there.
I’m working on it. I understand now where the dread came from, and I understand that the negative messages I received from the adults in my life were due to miscommunication on my part.
I feel a bit embarrassed that my anxiety disorder was caused by such a minor thing as a part-time job… but I know that’s my anxiety talking, and my mental health issues are still valid. It has taken me a long time to accept that.",GAD
1126,"Being diagnosed with GAD is obviously not very heartening considering the daily trauma that you already go through. It is all the more difficult since GAD means you find it difficult to understand specifics in terms of situations or instances where you tend to get anxious.Everything tends to get you anxious (atleast in my case)
I too was diagnosed with GAD. I tend to fear anything and everything which happens with or around me. On my way to work, i am worried about the worst that could happen to me, on the way back i am still worried about the same and at the same time i am worried about getting into an accident while driving. At home i am constantly thinking about all the worst situations which may happen to me. I have this anxious bout in my stomach througout the day, no matter if it is a weekend or a weekday. Drinking helped only to sleep for sometime but once i am awake things repeat and its the same pattern, i am always worried.
I met a couple of phycatrists for the same and both concluded that i had GAD. One suggested counselling while the other suggested some medications. However, i was somehow not convinced to accept either of those.
After reading about GAD, i did realize that there is no magic treatment or medication for GAD or any anxiety related disorders. Since it is directly related to our thoughts it is really difficult to control the same using medications (they may help suppressing it, but not remove it altogether). I decided not to take any counselling or medication
What i did was, i spoke to my best friend about it. I discussed everything and every thought i had. It was a huge relief. I joined a gym and started working out. The 1 hour that i spend in the gym helps me stay occupied and also distracts me enough to ensure that i do not fall in the trap of my thoughts. The anxious bouts have now reduced (although i still do get them) , my drinking habit has changed.
I still do keep on talking about it, however now i do not confident that i can tackle the disorder more effectively than before . I am still in the process of getting out of it , but what i have realized in distraction is the best medicine. Taking small steps to distract your mind and keep it focussed for smaller durations has done wonders to me. Eventually it would become a habit and the mind will no longer be able to trick you or me into the lost world.
Hope this helps. Keep fighting and do not give up.

Some people can’t even enjoy going on a relaxing vacation because of it.
I am not going into all the other types of illness because some mental illnesses do cause a person to have constant worry but it is not the same type of feeling as generalized anxiety. Also, that would be too long and technical to enjoyably read.
Normal anxiety lessens once you are past a stressor.",GAD
1128,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1129,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
1130,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help.

Being anxious is to think of as the start up
it's like the worry is there and is circular a few things or feels have been alerted in the mind or senses its the nervousness in action like a shudder like instance its there we are alert to just its not quite there
anxiety is a different matter usually after being anxious has started or kicked in its like it passes another level and anxiety is it not just the senses anxiety is the seeing of the alertness side anxiety is the shake up of the shuddering its the next stage anxiety comes with more intense energy plus worrying its a mixture of both anxious sets you off anxiety is the draw back

A simple way I distinguish Anxiety disorders is that they all represent a fear of something: health, phobia, panic PTSD; memory of trauma, social anxiety and OCD: fear that you hold responsibility for something specifically bad happening and you need to remove the thought by doing a routine/ritual. But with GAD the fear is uncertainty and this fuels worry. Any situation that generates future ‘what it’ thoughts turns on worry, that turns on anxiety, that turns on more negative predictions and generates more uncertainty.",GAD
1134,Usually antidepressants have to do with boosting your serotonin levels the my opinion serotonin levels too high can cause anxiety if anything I believe that a benzodiazepine should be taken with the antidepressants there is a condition called serotonin syndrome which is obviously too much serotonin in your system a benzo like Klonopin or Valium can level that out which a lot of doctors are reluctant to prescribe them but may myself have been on cymbalta alone with nothing else thought I was going to lose my mind and I was taking them for panic attacks and they were actually causing panic attacks reason is myself turning levels were too high so I went to another doctor and he prescribed me a benzo and I felt much better and my panic attacks subsided this is my opinion,GAD
1135,"Certainly, here is the revised text in a more reassuring and friendly tone:
Hi there,
I understand you've been dealing with panic disorder and anxiety for quite some time, and I want to share my experience, which might offer some hope. For nearly 25 years, I grappled with similar challenges.
Medications:
I tried several antidepressants with limited success, often experiencing side effects. However, adding Olanzapine seemed to make a significant difference. It helped me move from a place of severe anxiety and bedridden days to being able to leave the house and reconnect with friends.
I also experimented with a combination of Pregabalin, Sertraline, and a Xanax-like medication. While this initial approach didn't provide lasting relief, Olanzapine truly marked a turning point.
It's crucial to remember that medication alone won't solve the underlying issues.
Beyond Medication:
After years of medication and therapy that felt less than helpful, I decided to take charge of my healing. I delved into the works of authors like Joe Dispenza, Tony Robbins, Gurdjieff, and Osho, focusing on inner work rather than solely on the medical approach.
Instead of constantly analyzing the ""why"" behind my anxiety, I began to observe it without judgment. I allowed the anxiety to rise, acknowledging it without trying to suppress it. This helped me understand that anxiety was a signal, a message from my soul that I wasn't living authentically.
The Turning Point:
This realization was a major breakthrough. I started to question if I was truly living according to my own values and desires, or if I was conforming to societal expectations. I began to see that my anxiety was a cry for help, a plea to embrace my true self.
Healing Journey:
I gradually tapered off all medications except Olanzapine, which I now take at a very low dose. The withdrawal process was challenging, with periods of intense emotional release. However, I embraced these moments as part of the healing journey.
Natural Support:
To support my mental and emotional well-being, I incorporated natural supplements. 5-HTP, a precursor to serotonin, helped alleviate the emotional dips I experienced during medication withdrawal. CBD oil, derived from the cannabis plant without the psychoactive effects of THC, has been incredibly helpful in managing anxiety. I started with a low dose and gradually increased it as needed.
Remember:
This is my personal journey, and what works for me may not work for everyone. It's essential to listen to your body, trust your intuition, and find what resonates with you.
Key Takeaway:
Living authentically is crucial. When you align with your true self, anxiety and depression can significantly diminish.
Additional Support:
Meditation, particularly guided meditations based on imagination, has been a valuable tool for me.
I hope this resonates with you. Remember, you're not alone on this journey.

1136,"Ssri doesn't always do it.
The drug for anxiety is diazepam and much of the same group of benzodiazepines.
The problem with this group of sedating medicines is that they can be addictive and very difficult to come off.because of this many doctors will not prescribe them or at least prescribe for only a short period.
Last I heard is if you take maximum dosage for 2 months about 50% of people will begin signs of addiction.
Personally I was prescribed diazepam for 20 years,it was hugely beneficial ,I never felt any addictive symptoms at all and I have stopped taking for 1 year as my panic attacks have gone,so it seems just as some people are addictive types and will get hooked on anything, some,like myself, have always found it very difficult to get addicted to anything.
There are alternatives such as ssri,beta blockers such as propranolol, and other sedative type drugs which are not addictive but generally they are not as powerful for anxiety as diazapam.
Klaus",GAD
1137,"Have your doctor do a trial of Ativan, an intermediate benzodiazepine, and see how that works. I’ve taken benzos all my life and I don’t have the putative symptom of mild cognitive impairment, have no tolerance so I never raised the dose and, frankly, I don’t plan on withdrawing for those whose business is founded on finding as any people as possible taking anything to fill beds. Two of my doctors, one Chairman of Psychiatry at a name brand university, uses Ativan as I do.",GAD
1138,"The reason SSRIs didn’t work is because they’re just placebo. What i’ve found is that there are really only three options.
Antihistamines- Stuff like Hydroxyzine is a very common one but I personally find that it crutches on the drowsy properties to successfully aid with mediating anxiety. Does not work for everyone, like me. It tended to be very counterintuitive, worsening my anxiety.
Beta Blockers- Stuff like Propranolol will just slow down your heart causing a great mediation of the physical symptoms of anxiety, which then in turn can cause your mind to calm down as your body is calm. I personally never experienced too great of effects from it but I know some people who love the medication, and it works wonders for them.
Benzodiazepines- The staple anxiety med, but also the most extreme and I would personally argue is not meant for GAD, seeing as it is much better used when anxiety peaks, rather than being used for continuous anxiety. This is only due to the dependency issues as well as the common impairing effects of a lot of benzos (some benzos like valium and klonopin will not be as impairing due to a longer release timeframe, but will still be pretty extreme)
My 2 cents is that if you truly do have gad, ask for beta blockers (obviously unless u have some sort of heart issue thatll cause dangerously low heart rates like hypotension)",GAD
1139,Don’t listen to these people I have panic attacks anxiety and ptsd and the only thing that works is benzos like Xanax or klonopin….trust me I’ve beeen on every ssri and it takes 6 weeks to even work and you have to take it everyday. Doctors are just scared cuz like some people abuse benzos but Xanax works right away and only lasts a few hours and you can take it long term or as needed there’s no science behind it causing dementia ..:.people abuse anything but I have a good psychiatrist he has me on an ssri lexapro to help decrease panic but he still has me on 2mg Xanax twice daily if I need it and for sleep it helps. And it’s a life saver really I’ve been going through a lot ptsd flashbacks and anxiety panic attacks and grief over when my favorite pet my boy cat ponyo died and my grandpa recently I have a husband and 5 year old daughter now my life is back on track and don’t listen to the uneducated doctors who only listen to the fda when they tell you benzos are bad or addicting….cuz in reality everything can be addicting,GAD
1140,"There are several general guidelines I teach my medical students about treating chronic anxiety disorders:
Perform a thorough evaluation to ensure there are no general medical disorders complicating the picture.
Gradually increase the dose of the SSRI chosen until the patient is well, or has side effects that don’t go away.
Refer to a psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment if the above doesn’t work.
In my practice, with my patients, I have found the therapeutic dose of SSRI’s to be twice that needed to treat depressive disorders. Therefore, I increase the dose until that level is reached.
I may change the SSRI to another one if the first produces side effects.
If needed, I have added Abilify to that regimen, which has shown proven efficacy in the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders.
Most often, a combination of SSRI plus aripiprazole works.
If you are not in treatment with a psychiatrist knowledgeable in the treatment of treatment resistant anxiety disorders, please find one.",GAD
1141,"There is no recipe book for prescribing psychiatric medications. SSRI’s are a reasonable choice. You need to be asking your doctor this question, not strangers who do not know your specific situation on Quora. Also there may be medical issues which effect your anxiety symptoms. Potential medical issues need to be ruled out. Some illnesses and conditions naturally increase anxiety so those illnesses or conditions may need treatment before you treat anxiety which is not “physical” in origin.
However, all emotions are somewhat physical in origin because our minds are located within our bodies. So instead of only relying on medication (which can be very helpful and effective so keep trying) , you can also make a commitment to use your mind and your brain to LEARN about anxiety and the many ways humans have developed to feel more in control of their lives and their feelings.
Here is an classic book which is old but it does teach a lot about anxiety very well and very simply “The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook” b E Bourne. You need to have a deeper understanding of the symptoms you experience to be a better partner with your medicating doctor. You are a team and you need to work together to find the best possible treatments for your GAD. I know it is disappointing but with anxiety and other issues, you cannot just expect to take a pill and feel all better.",GAD
1142,"There are several including Paroxetine. Escitalopram and Venlafaxine - but….. rule number 1. DO NOT take advice about stuff like this from some random stranger on the internet. There are MANY factors that have to be considered here.

1143,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a common mental health condition characterized by excessive worry and anxiety that persists for extended periods and interferes with daily life. Fortunately, several effective medication classes can help manage GAD symptoms. Here's an overview of some commonly prescribed medications:
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):
First-line treatment: SSRIs are often the first-line medication class for GAD due to their effectiveness and tolerability.
How they work: SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood regulation. By enhancing serotonin activity, they can alleviate anxiety symptoms like excessive worry, tension, and restlessness.
Examples: Common SSRIs used for GAD include escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil).
Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):
Alternative option: SNRIs can be an alternative for those who don't respond well to SSRIs.
Mechanism of action: SNRIs work similarly to SSRIs but additionally affect norepinephrine, another brain chemical influencing mood and alertness.
Examples: Venlafaxine (Effexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta) are SNRIs commonly prescribed for GAD.
Buspirone:
Unique mechanism: Buspirone works differently from SSRIs and SNRIs. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's thought to influence specific neurotransmitters involved in anxiety.
Slower onset: Unlike SSRIs and SNRIs, buspirone typically takes several weeks to show its full effects.
Advantage: Buspirone is less likely to cause some common side effects associated with SSRIs and SNRIs, such as sexual dysfunction and sedation.
Benzodiazepines:
Short-term relief: Benzodiazepines are fast-acting medications that provide short-term relief from anxiety symptoms.
Use with caution: Due to their potential for dependence and addiction, benzodiazepines are typically only prescribed for short-term use or in specific situations like managing severe anxiety during a panic attack.
Examples: Alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin) are some commonly used benzodiazepines.
Choosing the Right Medication:
The best medication for GAD depends on individual factors like:
Severity of symptoms
Medical history
Response to previous medications
Potential side effects
It's important to work with a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate medication and dosage for your individual needs.
They can also monitor for side effects and adjust the medication regimen as needed.
Additional Considerations:
Non-medication approaches: Therapy, relaxation techniques, and lifestyle changes can be helpful alongside medication in managing GAD.
Combination therapy: In some cases, a combination of medication classes or medication with therapy might be necessary for optimal symptom control.
By working with a healthcare professional and exploring different treatment options, you can find an effective approach to manage GAD symptoms and improve your quality of life.",GAD
1144,"Among ssri's paroxetine Is often the most effective for anxiety disorders.
If that doesn't work i would try the snri venlafaxine, its usually very effective against anxiety without being sedating.
The TCA's clomipramine amitrptyline and imipramine are effective but they can have more side effects.
Pregabalin Is approved for gad, your doctor could add It to ssri/snri medication to make It more effective. Pregabalin Is sedating, but not as addictive as benzos.
Seroquel xr can help too

1145,"Through Therapy and medication. Doctors will prescribe anti-anxiety medication short term combined with therapy to see if the patient improves. Remember, anti-anxiety drugs can be habit forming and many are also abused. Doctors are being a bit more cautious now about prescribing drugs like Ativan and Xanax long term.
A General Practitioner or Psychiatrist is qualified to treat anxiety disorders. However, I recommend seeing a Psychiatrist because he or she can offer therapy as part of a treatment plan. General Practitioners can only offer drugs as treatment for anxiety disorders. In many cases, the person needs more than just drugs to cope with an anxiety disorder. Drugs are not a long term solution for anyone suffering from a disorder such as this. Be careful when you see the doctor for the first time. IF he or she is under the impression you are just seeking drugs you may walk out of the office quite disappointed. Allow the doctor to properly evaluate you.",GAD

There really is no '’one medication"" that is most effective.

During my early twenties I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. One of the worst made me exit my car in the middle of the highway at night because I was thinking I was going to die; I felt pins and needles all over my body, felt that I couldn’t breathe and my heart was racing ao fast I though it was going to explode.
That is anxiety, that is what anxiety does.
Then you can’t stop thinking about it and when the next attack will be.
I went to a psychologist who then sent me to a pychiatrist.
He was very good. He listened to me, asked a lot of questions and so on. He also gave me Sertraline (an SSRI anti depressant) and Xanax, but told me not to take Xanax and just to do when I had an attack. I never had to take Xanax in the end.
I wasn’t depressed but the SSRI helps you get better at your anxiety. And it did.
After a month or so after starting I felt great. I was no longer worried about dying or grtting another attack. I could live life again.
I took them for almost 2 years. Now I’m almost 30 and been 3–4 years without them.
I sill struggle with anxiety at times but haven’t had and attack since.
Also I learned to read and listen to my body; I know when the anxiety is creeping in and I can stop it before getting an attack.
I’m married and have a great job and living life to the fullest.

1157,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible.

The term “What If” dominates nearly every thought, situation and moment. What if he hates me? What happens if this bus crashes right now? What happens if I get fired at work tomorrow? You can create whole, detailed, terrified scenarios in your mind, which reduce you to tears and absolute fear.
Sweaty palms! Sweaty forehead! Sweaty everything!
Yes we may stutter, go red or avoid eye contact— even just saying hi to the nice elderly neighbour.
It doesn't just go away. It's ALWAYS there. It's great for your friend if they can calm down after nearly crashing their car and forgetting an hour later. Whereas, seeing your friend has tagged everyone but you in a post can cause absolute terror for days on end.
It is very physically demanding on your body. The constant heart pounding, causing your blood pressure to go all over the place. It can lead to weight loss or people comfort eating, to keep energy going. Your muscles can ache from being tense or clenching your jaw etc.
Anxiety is actually cortisol. Its released from glands in your body, it's a massive boost of adrenaline. This is GREAT if you're on the run from a murderer with an axe, it's not so great when you're just trying to board a train and you're breathing so quickly, everything around you feels like it's too bright, too fast.
Don't ever tell someone with anxiety to “calm down and get over It.” Please research ways to help someone with anxiety, it could be distraction techniques I.e. going outside on a walk. It could be mindfulness, sitting with the person for 5 minutes and doing some breathing exercises. You could also get some paper and ask the anxiety sufferer to write down the problem, next to that, write a list of outcomes the anxiety sufferer is concerned by, next to each possible outcome, write ‘evidence’ for this issue. I.e. The Problem: ‘I'm concerned my partner hasn't text me back today’ — what outcome worries you about this? ‘Maybe he's had enough of me, maybe he has left, maybe he's met a new girl at work and is sleeping with her’ Next to each of those outcomes, write “Evidence to Support this theory” — this is where rationality will start to break it down. So continuing with my example “Evidence supporting him leaving me… well actually he told me he loved me this morning and we have been together or xxx years now and he has promised me he would tell me if he felt there were any issues in our relationship, nobody on earth, meets someone at work for 2 hours and sleeps with them, especially when they're in a happy relationship”
Even with the above ideas in Number 10, it will need reinforcing like a parrot or broken record, constant repetition of rational sense but be sure you listen to the anxiety sufferer and don't sound dismissive of their concerns.
Set up a system with your friends, anxiety isn't rational, so ensure your friends know you have this illness and speak to them. It could even be that one friend will go up to the till to order your coffee for you, so you don't have the anxiety pressure of talking to the barista etc. It could also be that you all agree you (the anxiety sufferer) can text them anytime to ask if they're okay with you. Even if it's once a week, you're texting asking if your fine is alright with you, a lot like what I was referring to above, it's repetitive reassurance. Your friends can text back “Yes of course, you silly bean!” This can apply to people in relationships too.
Don't let an anxiety sufferer see your phone or laptop. It will never stop there. It will grow and before you know it, the anxiety sufferer will be controlling, this will cause issues and relationship breakdowns. I've been there, believe me. I have the anxiety and my partner is very good looking and has lots of female friends. I have caught parts of conversations, due to peeping and gotten the wrong end of the stick each of the 4 times I did it. I was proven it too. My partner has a code on his phone, he would give me it but I (I mean It, me, as the anxiety sufferer) had to say NO! I knew it would destroy us. He has never cheated and me doing that to him, would enforce my anxiety further, it would break down his trust in me and make him feel hurt. —something we forget when in our anxiety, we can forget our accusations can hurt and be painful. That was 4 years ago now and my anxiety has eased so much with my partner. I've never wanted to look at his phone since those first few weeks and I'm proud I didn't because we wouldn't be where we are today.
Getting through each day is bloody tough for an anxiety sufferer. Give yourself a pat on the back for achieving it. Believe me, it is a great achievement.
Best of luck to all sufferers of anxiety and people supporting those with generalised anxiety.",GAD
1160,"What Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder?
People who suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD, worry uncontrollably about common occurrences and situations. It’s also sometimes known as chronic anxiety neurosis.
GAD is different than normal feelings of anxiousness. It’s common to feel anxious about the things happening in your life — like your finances — every once in awhile. A person who has GAD may worry uncontrollably about their finances several times a day for months on end. This can happen even when there isn’t a reason to worry. The person is often aware that there is no reason for them to worry. Sometimes people with this condition just worry, but they are unable to say what they are worried about. They report feelings that something bad may happen or may report that they just can’t calm themselves.
This excessive, unrealistic worry can be frightening and can interfere with relationships and daily activities.

Part 2 of 7: Symptoms
Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Symptoms of GAD include:
difficulty concentrating
difficulty sleeping
irritability
fatigue/exhaustion
muscle tension
repeated stomachaches or diarrhea
sweating palms
shaking
rapid heartbeat
neurological symptoms such as complaints of numbness/tingling of different parts of the body
Distinguishing GAD from Other Mental Health Issues
Anxiety is a common symptom of many mental health conditions, like depression and various phobias. GAD is different from these conditions in several ways.
People experiencing depression may occasionally feel anxious. People suffering from phobias worry about one particular thing, but people suffering from GAD worry about a number of different topics over a long period of time (six months or more), or may not be able to identify the source of their worry.
Part 3 of 7: Causes and Risk Factors
What Are the Causes and Risk Factors of GAD?
Causes of and risk factors for GAD may include:
a family history of anxiety
recent or prolonged exposure to stressful situations, including personal or family illnesses
excessive use of caffeine or tobacco (which can make existing anxiety worse)
being the victim of childhood abuse
According to the Mayo Clinic, women are twice as likely to experience GAD than men.

Part 4 of 7: Diagnosis
How Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder Diagnosed?
GAD is diagnosed with a mental health screening that your primary care provider can perform. They will ask you questions about your symptoms and how long you’ve been experiencing them. They can refer you to a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.
Medical tests may also be used to determine whether there is an underlying illness or substance abuse problem causing your symptoms. Anxiety has been linked to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), thyroid disorders, heart disease, and menopause.
If your primary care provider suspects that a medical condition or substance abuse problem is the cause of the anxiety, they may perform more tests. These may include:
blood tests — to check hormone levels (thyroid disorders)
urine tests — to check for substance abuse
gastric reflux tests (X-ray of your digestive system, endoscopy procedure to look at your esophagus) — to check for GERD
X-rays and stress tests (monitoring your heart function while you exercise) — to check for heart conditions
Part 5 of 7: Treatment
How Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder Treated?
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
This involves meeting regularly to talk with a mental health professional. The goal is to change your thinking and behaviors. This approach has been successful in achieving permanent change in many people who suffer from anxiety, and is considered first-line treatment of anxiety disorders in persons who are pregnant. Others have found that the benefits of cognitive behavioral therapy have provided long-term relief from anxiety.
In therapy sessions, you will learn how to recognize and control your anxious thoughts. Your therapist will also teach you how to calm yourself when upsetting thoughts arise.
Doctors often prescribe medicines along with therapy to treat GAD.
Drugs and Medication
Your prescriber will most likely create a short-term medication plan and a long-term medication plan.
Short-term medications relax some of the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as muscle tension and stomach cramping. These are called anti-anxiety medicines. Some common anti-anxiety medications are:
alprazolam (Xanax)
clonazepam (Klonopin)
lorazepam (Ativan)
buspirone (Buspar)
Anti-anxiety medicines aren’t meant to be taken for long periods of time, as they have a high risk for dependence and abuse.
Medicines called antidepressants work well for long-term treatment. Some common antidepressants are:
citalopram (Celexa)
escitalopram (Lexapro)
fluoxetine (Prozac, Prozac Weekly, Sarafem)
fluvoxamine (Luvox, Luvox CR)
paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil CR, Pexeva)
sertraline (Zoloft)
venlafaxine (Effexor XR)
desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)
duloxetine (Cymbalta)
These medicines can take a few weeks to start working. They can also have side effects, such as dry mouth, nausea, and diarrhea. These symptoms bother some people so much that they stop taking these medications.
There is a very low risk of young adults experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts at the beginning of treatment with antidepressants. Stay in close contact with your prescriber if you’re taking antidepressants. Make sure you report any mood or thought changes that worry you.
Your doctor may prescribe both an anti-anxiety medication and an antidepressant. If so, you’ll probably only take the anti-anxiety medicine for a few weeks until your antidepressant starts working, or on an as-needed basis.

Part 6 of 7: Lifestyle
Lifestyle Changes to Help Ease Symptoms of GAD
Many people can find relief by adopting certain lifestyle habits. These may include:
regular exercise, a healthy diet, and plenty of sleep
yoga and meditation
avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine, and some over-the-counter medicines such as diet pills or caffeine pills
talking with a trusted friend, spouse, or family member about fears and worries
Alcohol and Anxiety
Drinking alcohol can make you feel less anxious almost immediately. This is why many people who suffer from anxiety turn to drinking alcohol to feel better.
However, it’s important to remember that alcohol can have a negative effect on your mood. Within a few hours or the day after drinking, you may experience more irritability or depression. It can also interfere with the medications used to treat the condition. Some medication and alcohol combinations can be fatal.
If you find that your drinking is interfering with your daily activities, talk to your primary care provider. You can also find free support to stop drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).
Part 7 of 7: Outlook
Outlook for Those with Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Most people can manage GAD with a combination of therapy, medicine, and lifestyle changes. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned about how much you worry. They can refer you to a mental health specialist.
What Is Agoraphobia?
Highlights
Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that makes people extremely fearful of places and situations that they see as dangerous or uncomfortable.
Agoraphobia is usually diagnosed in early adulthood. By that point, the condition is usually so severe that it interferes with everyday life.
Agoraphobia is a lifelong disorder that requires ongoing treatment. Therapy and medications may be used to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder that causes people to avoid places and situations that might cause them to feel:
trapped
helpless
panicked
embarrassed
scared
People with agoraphobia often have symptoms of a panic attack, such as a rapid heartbeat and nausea, when they find themselves in a stressful situation. They may also experience these symptoms before they even enter the situation they dread. In some cases, the condition can be so severe that people avoid doing daily activities, such as going to the bank or grocery store, and stay inside their homes most of the day.
The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that 0.8 percent of American adults have agoraphobia. About 40 percent of cases are considered severe. When the condition is more advanced, agoraphobia can be very disabling. People with agoraphobia often realize their fear is irrational, but they’re unable to do anything about it. This can interfere with their personal relationships and performance at work or school.
If you suspect you have agoraphobia, it’s important to receive treatment as soon as possible. Treatment can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Depending on the severity of your condition, treatment may consist of therapy, medications, and lifestyle remedies.

Part 2 of 6
What Are the Symptoms of Agoraphobia?
People with agoraphobia are typically:
afraid of leaving their home for extended periods of time
afraid of being alone in the social situation
afraid of losing control in a public place
afraid of being in places where it would be difficult to escape, such as a car or elevator
detached or estranged from others
anxious or agitated
Agoraphobia often coincides with panic attacks. Panic attacks are a series of symptoms that sometimes occur in people with anxiety and other mental health disorders. Panic attacks can include a wide range of severe physical symptoms, such as:
chest pain
a racing heart
shortness of breath
dizziness
trembling
choking
sweating
hot flashes
chills
nausea
diarrhea
numbness
tingling sensations
People with agoraphobia may experience panic attacks whenever they enter a stressful or uncomfortable situation, which further enhances their fear of being in an uncomfortable situation.
Part 3 of 6
What Causes Agoraphobia?
The exact cause of agoraphobia isn’t known. However, there are several factors that are known to increase your risk of developing agoraphobia. These include having:
depression
other phobias, such as claustrophobia and social phobia
another type of anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder
a history of physical or sexual abuse
a substance abuse problem
a family history of agoraphobia
Agoraphobia is also more common in women than in men. It usually begins in young adulthood, with 20 years being the average age of onset. However, symptoms of the condition can emerge at any age.
Advertisement
Part 4 of 6
How Is Agoraphobia Diagnosed?
Agoraphobia is diagnosed based on symptoms and signs. Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms, including when they started and how often you experience them. They’ll ask questions related to your medical history and family history as well. They may also perform blood tests to help rule out physical causes for your symptoms.
In order to be diagnosed with agoraphobia, your symptoms need to meet certain criteria listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a manual often used by healthcare providers to diagnose mental health conditions.
You must feel intense fear or anxiety in two of more of the following situations to be diagnosed with agoraphobia:
using public transportation, such as a train or bus
being in open spaces, such as a store or parking lot
being in enclosed spaces, such as an elevator or car
being in a crowd
being away from home alone
There are additional criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia. You must have recurrent panic attacks, and at least one panic attack must have been followed by:
a fear of having more panic attacks
a fear of the consequences of panic attacks, such as having a heart attack or losing control
a change in your behavior as a result of the panic attacks
You won’t be diagnosed with agoraphobia if your symptoms are caused by another illness. They also can’t be caused by substance abuse or another disorder.
Part 5 of 6
How Is Agoraphobia Treated?
There are a number of different treatments for agoraphobia. You’ll most likely need a combination of treatment methods.
Therapy
Psychotherapy
Psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy, involves meeting with a therapist or other mental health professional on a regular basis. This gives you the opportunity to talk about your fears and any issues that may be contributing to your fears. Psychotherapy is often combined with medications for optimum effectiveness. It’s generally a short-term treatment that can be stopped once you’re able to cope with your fears and anxiety.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most common form of psychotherapy used to treat people with agoraphobia. CBT can help you understand the distorted feelings and views associated with agoraphobia. It can also teach you how to work through stressful situations by replacing the distorted thoughts with healthy thoughts, allowing you to regain a sense of control in your life.
Exposure Therapy
Exposure therapy can also help you overcome your fears. In this type of therapy, you’re gently and slowly exposed to the situations or places you fear. This may make your fear diminish over time.
Medications
Certain medications can help relieve your agoraphobia or panic attack symptoms. These include:
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil) or fluoxetine (Prozac)
selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine (Effexor) or duloxetine (Cymbalta)
tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil) or nortriptyline (Pamelor)
anti-anxiety medications, such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam (Klonopin)
Lifestyle Changes
Lifestyle changes won’t necessarily treat agoraphobia, but they may help reduce everyday anxiety. You may want to try:
exercising regularly to increase the production of brain chemicals that make you feel happier and more relaxed
eating a healthy diet that consists of whole grains, vegetables, and lean protein so you feel better overall
practicing daily meditation or deep breathing exercises to reduce anxiety and fight the onset of panic attacks
During treatment, it’s best to avoid taking dietary supplements and herbs. These natural remedies aren’t proven to treat anxiety, and they may interfere with the effectiveness of prescribed medications.

What Is the Outlook for People with Agoraphobia?
It isn’t always possible to prevent agoraphobia. However, early treatment for anxiety or panic disorders may help. With treatment, you have a good chance of getting better. Treatment tends to be easier and faster when it’s started earlier, so if you suspect you have agoraphobia, don’t hesitate to seek help. This disorder can be quite debilitating since it prevents you from participating in everyday activities. There’s no cure, but treatment can greatly relieve your symptoms and improve your quality of life.",GAD
1161,"Well a specific phobia is easily the most different of the three. It's a pervasive sense of fear, anxiety, or disgust causing someone to NEED to avoid such a thing. For instance, I have trypophobia (fear of many holes, tiny holes) and claustrophobia (fear of dark enclosed spaces.)
My trypophobia makes me have to look away, feel incredibly nauseous, and almost start crying just by seeing them. It feels as though my skin is crawling. It isn't always just holes, it can be circles such as this beach texture in Pokemon Legends Arceus that makes me feel icky or the way wasps nests look. I love Steven Universe, but seeing the kindergartens (which are where gems break out through the earth in a mass production thing so lots of holes) made me want to cry and I could NOT look at the screen. My claustrophobia is a bit different as it's mostly enclosed or tiny spaces. I feel trapped and terrified and may have a panic attack. I get that way in cars as well. The dark does make it worse (I also have a fear of the dark), but just the thought makes me feel like I could die. It's intense fear/anxiety/disgust at these specific things. It can be so genuinely upsetting for people. For instance, I think it was some trashy show, but they brought in a woman who was afraid of olives and promised her they wouldn't show her then then they brought out olives anyway. The reason she feared them was because it reminded her of the eyes of a corpse of a family member. It was a traumatic experience and a trigger for her. Phobias can be brought about by traumatic experiences which can be small or minor things as well. I can't say for sure where my phobias come from, but they can't be helped either way. So phobias typically have a specific trigger.
While GAD and SAD can have triggers, they are typically scenarios, different, etc. Phobias always have the same trigger with it being something that resembles the phobia (for instance, it may not be the exact same object or thing, but it's similar enough that the brain thinks of it like that.) While GAD and SAD have far more broad triggers. For instance, my GAD is triggered by a lot of scenarios involving people as well as my trauma. It plays into how I react and worsens my PDs. But it isn't strictly social scenarios, it can be anything where it feels as though something will go wrong.
SAD is socially based entirely. Thoughts of social interactions, being out in public, feeling constantly scrutinized, wondering if people are watching or looking at you, wondering if you sound normal just to name a few. My GAD affects me socially, but it is GENERALIZED anxiety in which case it is far more broad. GAD for others can include something bad happening to people, feeling like it's the end of the world over small things, fearing an actual end of the world, anxiety constantly where it's just like everything feels like it'll go wrong and pervasive thoughts of “what if this happens or that happens?” SAD is pervasive anxiety in social situations, whether it's online, over text, in person, just being in public, on call, etc. Both disorders are pervasive and regular experienced, aka chronic even when they aren't actively in a scenario. While phobias are often not constant and only when a person is around the specific thing they fear or something that resembles it. For instance, someone fearing wide open spaces may encounter it more so they'll be more triggered than something like a phobia of cats where they can often be avoided. Or olives can typically be avoided and while thunderstorms may not always be avoidable since weather is unpredictable so if you're in a place with such weather patterns, you can't exactly avoid it.",GAD
1162,"General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves excessive worry about various aspects of life, while agoraphobia is characterized by a fear of situations where escape may be difficult. Agoraphobia often leads to avoidance of specific places or situations. Both conditions are treatable with therapy and support. Understanding these differences is crucial for tailored interventions. Follow my Quora profile for more discussions on anxiety-related topics.",GAD
1163,"Well the core symptoms are different. GAD has rumination, muscle tension, fatigue, restlessness or on edge feeling, irritability, troubles concentrating, sleep disturbances. Agoraphobia is the fear of not being able to escape or gain help to escape situations/ events.",GAD
1164,"I don’t know when I ever felt “normal” anxiety, but from what I’ve observed, it’s more reasonable than GAD-anxiety. A lot more.
The metaphor I like using (and I’ve seen around a lot) is that it’s like missing a step while climbing the stairs. Normal anxiety is panicking for a few seconds before you catch yourself; once your foot is on the next step, you sigh in relief and continue on, likely forgetting about it ten minutes later.
Generalized anxiety is when there is no other step and it feels like you’re falling forever, and it takes a while before you find your footing again as your brain is yelling at you that there will never be another step and you doomed yourself.
Normal anxiety is when you worry about sensible things; an exam, job interview, asking someone you like out for the very first time, things like that.
GAD is also worrying about those things, but everything is upped to 11,000. It’s slightly different for each person, but from my experience, I get nervous about tests and social groups the moment I learn about them. Everyday things that everyone goes through, I panic inside about all the ways it can go wrong. I can’t even play guessing games with my friends because I panic over nothing. The simple English class homework assignment that’s a page long? Takes me over two hours to do because I think there’s a trick question somewhere and “it can’t be this easy”.
The worst and most drastic difference between the two? Normal anxiety is temporary. GAD causes those who have it to often be on edge; I’d have trouble even staying outside on a windy, peaceful day because - true story - I’ll jump after hearing a leaf land on concrete. That wouldn’t register in a person’s mind if they didn’t have anxiety, besides maybe observing the leaf fall.
Another way to think of it is GAD is having a mental sonar radar always on. When there’s a sudden noise or something unexpected happens, there’s a red flashing “ping” on the radar. Everything in your body goes to Red Alert, and will continue until the source/reason of the suddenness is discovered and deemed harmless, then to wait until the nerves calm down from being frazzled.
I hope that all helps!",GAD
1165,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,

1166,"Maybe it's not fair for me to answer this question as I only had the feelings close to this disorder for a few months, and GAD varies from one person to another, but I'll take this private part of my journal and share it with you, it was like a nightmare, here it is: (I also mentioned what it's like to have a panic attack)
The feeling of death.
It creeps in slowly, or all at once. You're scared, you're so scared, and you're scared of being scared and you're worried. And you're worried of being worried, and you move in circles.
There's this hole inside me, the hole that no one could ever see, the hole I can feel getting bigger, it makes me unable to breathe, it makes my mouth dry, it makes me afraid. It makes me so afraid of anything around me.
And then there's the attack, the minutes, hours of definite death gnawing at you. The minutes, hours your heart beats so fast, so loudly that you think it might pop out of your chest, and who knows, maybe it will. The infinite dread, the spinning of the world around you, the immediate thoughts of yourself going crazy, for something terribly bad happening or will happen at any second, the feeling of the world ending. The inability to breath, the dry mouth, the feeling of desth. And you can do nothing about it, you lie there, helpless, hopeless, terrified. You try to shake it away, to distract yourself, to scream, but nothing works. Nothing will ever work. The minutes, which feel like hours, not to soon leave you, but whilst making sure that it took everything along with it. Your energy, your power, it replaces it with fatigue, exhaustion, dread, and helplessness.
And more importantly, your happiness.
It never stops. Just as you think you won't have it again, or that, perhaps, you've controlled it, it comes again to show you otherwise. To make the contrary reality, to show its power over you. How vulnerable you truly are.
There's not one moment you can breathe, living with fear, with anxiety, is unbearable. It's like that moment before the exam, or that moment when someone shocks you, or that moment you accidentally miss the stairs, but throughout the whole day. The whole week, and there's nothing you can do about it.
'Stop it.', 'It's not true.', 'Stop fearing, stop worrying, nothing is worth it, please stop.' You're trying your best, you try to convince yourself it's not real, the fear is unreasonable, the fear should go away. But instead, you're welcomed with even more fear.
You just cannot stop thinking about something bad happening. You cannot normally take the stairs without thinking you'll trip, you'll fall and break your bones. You'll die. You cannot walk in the streets without thinking that you'll brutally get attacked, stabbed. Without getting hit by a car, maybe a plane. And you know it's stupid, you know it's so stupid, but you're helpless.",GAD
1167,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD

Hello
We have a natural defence mechanism called fight or flight against any external threat to us. Whenever we are triggered of a threat, a hormone called Cortisol is released in our blood. This increases our heart beat rate and blood pressure. Diverts blood from our internal organs to our brain and limbs. Dialets our pupils and makes us more alert. In other words makes us battle ready to face the external threat.
If we are triggered frequently and then there is no external threat to react with. The Cortisol level in our blood becomes high and it gives us stress or anxiety, which after some time after the hormone is metabolised goes away. In anxiety one feels very restless, fearful, jittery, uncomfortable, negative thoughts, etc.
Now Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD is a mental health disorder. It requires professional help to overcome. It's similar to anxiety but on a 24X7 basis even without triggers.
GAD can be treated by consulting a psychiatrist for checking, diagnosis and prescription of medicines. Another way of treatment can be consulting a CBT Therapist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, talk therapy, which is as effective as medicines.
Regular exercise and meditation, pranayama, also helps in allivieating anxiety levels along with adoption of relaxation techniques.
All the best.",GAD
1169,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
1170,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is when you worry about small things and get overanxious thinking about them. For instance, you’re running out of your food tonight, so you get worried that you have to buy your food tomorrow. So, you get worrying about things like, what if I get up late tomorrow to go to the supermarket, what if my favorite food runs out of stock tomorrow etc etc. So, you’d excessively worry about small things like schools, works or worse, in case of a meeting and etc etc.
Whereas, a social anxiety is when you get nervous when interacting with other people. Or get worrying too much about how you’re going to have a good conversation and what if the conversation turns to be bad.
So, the basic difference is that in Social Anxiety, people get anxious only when it relates to social interaction, but in case of GAD, people get anxious on small issues even if it doesn’t involve social interactions. Nevertheless, a person may develop both at the same time.",GAD
1171,"I don’t really know. In the past I have suffered from severe CLINICAL ANXIETY. Who is to saywhat my experience was? I have Aspergers. It is not something I turn on and off.
Apergers is the only identity I have. It is no good me passing an opinion comparing my anxiety with someone elses.
You can look at it this way. My brain configuration is peculiar to me. I can form new neural pathways that link dot to dot from one neuron to the next. Some gaps are too far apart to link directly. The message can still get though whether there is a direct route or not. Sometimes it takes longer for the penny to drop. Alternatively, if the neurons are clumped closely together I get the message quick as lightning.
Message received and understood. You in your way, and I in mine.
Iif the messages are received more quickly than I can assimilate them I am in trouble.
I get easily spooked and habe physical reaction without even having time to comprehend what is going on. Each volley of new sensory input is overwhelming. I can try to catch it which leaves me saturated and stressed out.
I can let it wash over me. As if I am simple minded. I can stay chilled - can I? Somepeople shout at me as if I am deaf. They might as well be talking in a foreign language. Some get cross and their irritation clams me up even more. I feel.bewildered about the angst they are throwing out at me.
The best people pause. Pause for thought. Some people use more nouns. Less words. “The car. Car key. Do you know where it is?” Now I know what they are talking about.

But anxiety, definitely doesn’t have a reason , sometimes my body’s chemistry goes into overdrive on adrenaline and I get really worked up, and I can’t calm it down immediately.

1173,"When people refer to anxiety, they generally mean generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are two different disorders. The distinguishing symptom of generalized anxiety disorder is continuously feeling on edge and moderately anxious, often without a specific reason. Panic disorder involves shorter episodes of extremely intense anxiety (panic attacks), again, often without a particular cause or reason. Panic attacks can occur in GAD, but they are not a distinguishing symptom.
Both of these conditions are quite complex, and I would recommend further research.",GAD

1175,"Understanding the difference between Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder is crucial for those seeking to comprehend their symptoms and find appropriate treatment. Both conditions fall under the umbrella of anxiety disorders, but they manifest differently and require distinct approaches for management and treatment. Here, we’ll explore the key differences between GAD and Panic Disorder.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
1. Definition
Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive, uncontrollable worry about various aspects of daily life. This worry is often disproportionate to the actual situation and can interfere with daily functioning.
2. Symptoms
People with GAD may experience a range of physical and psychological symptoms, including:
Persistent worrying or anxiety about multiple areas of life (e.g., work, health, social interactions)
Restlessness or feeling on edge
Fatigue
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep problems include restless, unsatisfactory sleep, difficulty falling or staying asleep, and so on.
3. Duration
The symptoms of GAD are chronic and can persist for months or even years. To be diagnosed with GAD, the excessive worry and anxiety must be present more days than not for at least six months.
4. Triggers
GAD does not usually have specific triggers. The anxiety and worry are pervasive and related to a variety of situations and events, making it challenging to pinpoint a particular cause.
Panic Disorder
1. Definition
Unexpected, frequent panic attacks are the hallmark of panic disorder. These attacks are sudden periods of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and can be accompanied by physical symptoms.
2. Symptoms
During a panic attack, individuals may experience:
Heart palpitations or accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking
breathing difficulties or a suffocating sensation
Feelings of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness
Chills or heat sensations
Numbness or tingling sensations
Depersonalization, or feeling cut off from oneself, or derealization, are two examples of these feelings.
Fear of losing control or ""going crazy""
Fear of dying
3. Duration
Panic attacks typically last for a few minutes but can occasionally persist longer. The frequency of panic attacks can vary widely, from several attacks a day to a few attacks a year.
4. Triggers
Panic attacks in Panic Disorder are often unexpected and can occur without an obvious trigger. However, some people may develop a fear of situations where they previously experienced a panic attack, leading to avoidance behaviors.
Key Differences
1. Nature of Anxiety
GAD: Anxiety is constant and related to various aspects of life.
Panic Disorder: Anxiety is episodic, occurring in the form of panic attacks that are intense but brief.
2. Triggers
GAD: Anxiety is generalized and not tied to specific situations or events.
Panic Disorder: Panic attacks can be unexpected and may not have a clear trigger.
3. Symptoms
GAD: Symptoms include ongoing worry, restlessness, fatigue, and physical symptoms like muscle tension.
Panic Disorder: Symptoms are acute during panic attacks, including heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and intense fear.
4. Duration
GAD: Symptoms are chronic and persist over a long period.
Panic Disorder: Panic attacks are short-lived but recur over time.
Conclusion
While both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder involve anxiety, they differ significantly in their presentation, triggers, and symptomatology. It is necessary to comprehend these variations in order to diagnose and treat patients effectively.

1176,"A typical generalised anxiety mental commentary: ""What if my plane crashes?""; ""What if my partner is late home because he got in a car accident?""; ""What if I get salmonella poisoning from this chicken that's about to expire?""; ""What if that dot on my skin is cancer?""; ""What if that leashed dog somehow attacks me as I walk past?"" Etc.
A typical social anxiety running commentary: ""What if my friend thinks I hate her because I took two days to reply to her text?""; ""What if I talk in this meeting and others think I sound dumb?""; ""What if I am honest and the person gets offended and doesn't like me anymore?""; ""What if I go to the party and nobody wants to talk to me and I look like a total loner?"" Etc.
In a nutshell, irrational fear of many different things going wrong vs. big fear of others thinking badly of you.",GAD
1177,"I’m not sure there is a big difference except maybe the extreme of phobia.
Phobias are when a person is so afraid of the thing in a super unnatural way, not for any logical reason.
Social anxiety feels like that to the sufferer. Feeling just so afraid of what hasn’t happened because of all the what if’s in their head.
I’m not sure it matters, though.
Feeling socially awkward is so common. People who look cool often are in their heads thinking about what other people are thinking about them.
Few people are so great that they just never think about how others are thinking.
Most of us are somewhere in between. And nobody is ever going to be so perfect that they don’t mess up or that they always look super great and perfect in front of other people.
Let’s just be real with ourselves and others. Nobody is perfect. Yes, try to have the best manners and social habits. Learn how to do small talk and respect others when they are speaking.
We all need to stop thinking that we must be broken because we said something that some person didn’t like. It’s impossible not to.
Do your best to learn the social rules and have good manners but always be kind to yourself! Love you! This will be the best outcome for all.",GAD
1178,"Yes. I take it for social anxiety and generalized anxiety. It definitely helps to not care as much about what others think and get rid of the feeling that you are being watched (when you clearly know you are not).
Stopping it will have some withdrawal and brings out the agoraphobia I used to have. Sometimes to the point of panic attacks just like many years before.. so it does help very much.",GAD
1179,"Gabapentin has a significant anti anxiety action and is used by providers off label for GAD. It works by mimicking the neurotransmitter GABA which has a calming effect. It takes a few weeks to start working and the patient must slowly titrate up the dose to effect.
When initiating gabapentin there can be usually transient side effects. The patient may feel depersonalization or irritable. Some people find the first couple weeks not tolerable. Gabapentin should also not be abruptly discontinued as this may result in rebound anxiety and agitation.",GAD
1180,"It can be.
Pregabalin, or Lyrica, was developed as an anti-epileptic drug (AED), but like most AEDS, it has been repurposed. Pregabalin is a gabapentinoid and is most commonly prescribed for nerve pain, but is increasingly used off-label for anxiety. Like other seizure medications, Lyrica works by stabilizing cell membranes. This prevents cascade events, i.e. a few misfirings turning into a major misfiring.
What’s special about Lyrica for anxiety is that, by stabilizing these membranes, it also extinguishes excitatory neurochemicals. There is also some evidence it inhibits the formation of excitatory neurons in general, as these can multiply over time in the setting of chronic anxiety.
The biggest drawback is that it can take a few weeks for pregabalin to kick in.
As far as side effects, most commonly Lyrica causes sedation, clumsiness, vision issues, confusion, difficulty speaking, weight gain, headache, memory loss.
Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine, and works on certain receptors that open cell channels to inhibitory neurochemicals. It is cross-reactive with alcohol. It works fast for anxiety, but wears off fast, leading to a peak-and-valley effect. This can lead to greater and greater use and eventually addiction.
Side effect profile of Xanax is similar to pregabalin. Xanax is a schedule IV controlled substance. Lyrica id a schedule V.",GAD
1181,"I've tried it. The jury is out with the scientific community whether this has any clinical value treating bipolar anxiety. I'm here to tell you it works.
My wife has it prescribed for nerve damage in her feet. I don't know how often she takes it, but I do know they're 600mg. I have a tendency to fly off the handle when I'm hypomanic. There's times when one of my hissy fits gets on her nerves and she'll insist on me taking one. She has to sit on my chest, hold my nose, and rub my tummy to get me to take it, but one hour later, I'm a happy little camper. It also helps me sleep and I've often used it in place of Ambien.",GAD
1182,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
1183,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
1184,"People think of pain as just…pain. Health care professionals must consider the origin of the pain to treat it properly. Muscle pain, visceral (abdominal) pain, bone pain, nerve pain (neuropathy) all have different origins and different characteristics. A medication that works on muscle pain doesn’t necessarily relieve nerve pain.
Enter gabapentin: If someone has a condition that causes neuropathy, an NSAID such as ibuprofen, while effective for other types of pain, doesn’t help much. Gabapentin is sometimes used to treat the neuropathy instead because it blocks nerve pain. I invite you to look up the medication and review how it works.
This leads us to ask why are cases of severe neuropathy on the rise, requiring more people to be treated with gabapentin? Circulatory diseases are particularly hard on the nerves of the extremities. A rise in cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which impair circulation, causes the nerves to be damaged but not destroyed. This causes altered sensations such as electrical shock, pins and needle, burning, pinching sensations of the feet. It’s excruciating and can be debilitating. Treating this type of pain with gabapentin or similar drug would be considered a responsible practice.
While it’s easy to blame doctors for “pushing” gabapentin, it is often the treatment of choice for people who have nerve damage from lifestyle preventable disease. While gabapentin is an appropriate treatment for many painful diseases, I conjecture that the rapid rise in its use correlates to the rapid rise in diseases that affect circulation.
Edit: I wanted to add that gabapentin is used for reasons other than neuropathy caused from poor circulation.",GAD
1185,"I can answer some of the pro’s. My wife has fibromyalgia. She must take Gabapentin to reduce or control the pain of her small fiber pain loop disorder. Without it, she would have constant migraine headaches and debilitating body pain.
She takes one 800mg tablet twice daily. During bad days, she must add a third one at about 4 pm on bad days. Those are generally days of fluctuating barometric pressure.
The only downside for her was not the long-term commitment to take them, it was the initial start. She could not tolerate the 100mg dose, which is the lowest dose manufactured. So, I got the physician’s ok and I compounded 25mg capsules for her. It took a month or so and she was using 100mg, then 300mg, then 400mg up to now 800mg doses.
She no longer has side effects of foggy brain and functions quite well.",GAD
1186,"Gabapentin has been prescribed by GP's, Pain Specialists, Nurse Practitioners, etc for the treatment of a variety of causes of neuropathic pain for decades. But it was originally prescribed for seizures. What's really interesting is they don't really know totally how it does any of those jobs. I don't know exactly when psychiatrists began prescribing it for anything other than the above conditions but I can offer some idea as to WHY. It's been found that the effects it has on the GABA receptors which elicit the same responses for the above conditions also can cause a decrease in depression symptoms in some people. Personally I have never found it to be effective on my peripheral neuropathy or my depression. Its derivative, Pregabalin, on the other hand reduced my neuropathy from being so horrible that I tried to take my own life. Now it is barely even present but I have to take a very high dose each day. I don't mind taking so much when the trade off is so life changing. The brand name of it is Lyrica and it was heavily marketed to people with Fibromyalgia. I'm just grateful for it. Again, this is just one case where gabapentin had no effect but the side effects I had were just awful but its derivative Pregabalin has had a literally life saving effect. I hope this answer is beneficial to you.",GAD
1187,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1188,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
1189,"I can honestly say that Gabapentin has worked so well to alleviate my anxiety (I am diagnosed with both Generalized Anxiety disorder, and Social Anxiety disorder.)
Keep in mind that everyone's brain chemistry is different, but I found that Gabapentin benefits me over other anxiety medications like benzodiazepines, because it relaxes the give-a-fuck center of my brain, but also it feels like I am given some energy. It makes me a tad more emotional than otherwise, but I feel like I was just.repressing my emotions anyway due to such anxiety and depression. Also…
I don't think it has a side effect of turning it's users into cleptomaniacs 😅",GAD
1190,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1191,"I used to be on gabapentin for my bipolar, cptsd, anxiety, depression…combined with Valium it was the best combination that helped me so much and then this doctor took it away and said that the Valium should help it all and I’ve been basically manic and bedridden since…these mood stabilizers and anti psychotics don’t work for me , seroquil gave me even more anxiety and left me like a zombie plus made me gain like 40 pound…. The only time I have ever felt completely normal with my condition is when I was on that combination now it may not work for everyone but I have nerve damage as well and terrible pain in my legs and feet and my whole body actually and it also helps with sleep and anxiety and now I am constantly suffering. I am currently trying to find a provider but I live in the Bible belt area and our healthcare system completely sucks. I have been so filled by the mental health care system that is shamefu…But back to the question does gabapentin help with bipolar for me 100% yes as soon as I take gabapentin I am up by the bed cleaning my house doing things like a normal person when I don’t have it I can barely move. So if you were on any antipsychotics or bipolar medication‘s, that has not worked for you because I have tried them all pretty much and the gabapentin did really work for me. If you have a doctor that is willing to let you try it I would say it is worth a try if nothing else has helped you",GAD
1192,"I prescribed gabapentin frequently for a variety of neuropathic pain syndromes, epilepsy, and for restless legs (RLS). I personally used it for management of sciatica (mercifully no longer present) and prescribe it to relatives with RLS.
it's an interesting medicine. One peculiar aspect is dosing. For various issues and different people, dosing varies from occasional, bedtime use of 50 mg up to 1200 mg every 4–6 hours. It is not metabolized in the body, nor is it protein bound to any great extent. After it is absorbed in the gut, it floats around, kissing nerve cells and making them better, before eventually being urinated unchanged. In essence, only your nerve cells know it's present; it doesn't rot organs or interact with other meds.
It's safe for long term use. Others have mentioned concerns about tolerance and dependence. IMO, the risk of these issues is zero. If, however, you are successfully treating neuropathic pain with it and your prescription runs out, you will miss it because neuropathic pain sucks. If you are using it for RLS, you will eventually need more because RLS slowly worsens. Perhaps it was prescribed for use as a sleep aid. If so, your doctor is smarter than most as it deepens sleep without disrupting sleep stages and is vastly safer than the antihistamines and benzodiazepines typically prescribed for that purpose.
No, you are unlikely to experience weight gain with occasional bedtime use of 100 mg. The most common problem with your dosage regimen would be sleeping too soundly and waking up like a slow loris rather than bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in the morning. If your regimen provides benefits and doesn't otherwise bother you, you've won.",GAD
1193,"I've been diagnosed with a few labels antipsychotics, anxiety etc. Had some damn strong medications im no expert but I have experience 3–5 years in treatment using antipsychotic drugs panic disorder paranoia . Antipsychotics are in many ways knockout drops. With that I could say with confidence the patient /person isn't depressed or anxious if they're hammered unconscious for sometimes 15/ 20 hours each day. I don't believe that there's any reasonably positive gain treating depression/anxiety with anti psychotics( in a extreme representation) like swatting flies with a shotgun killed the fly…look at the wall …anti psychs…should be more monitored for close observation and for other health concerns.",GAD
1194,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1195,"I had been on that medication, 600mg x 3 for a couple of years. Was prescribed it for pain (did dick for the pain) but did help mildly with some underlying anxiety so prescribing doctor let me continue taking it and also told me I could quit it at any time cold turkey. Well a few months back I did just that and it was a month, month-and-a-half of restless leg, and emotions stuck either in rage or despair mode. Was about a week in that I made the connection and by that time I figured I would just white knuckle my way through it vs. trying to start a taper. That medication has been blacklisted with me.",GAD
1196,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
1197,"Gabapentin has helped me tremendously with anxiety, I also have nerve pain in my ankles from a car accident but I was originally prescribed gabapentin for generalized anxiety disorder. I take 300mg 3x a day and I have less panic attacks, as well as less social anxiety. I struggled for a long time without it and I am doing much better now so I highly recommend it. It seems like it works differently for different people, but it is definitely worth a shot.",GAD
1198,"Developing an addiction to gabapentin, when prescribed by a doctor for legitimate medical reasons like pain and anxiety, is a topic that requires careful consideration of several factors. Gabapentin is primarily used to treat seizures and nerve pain (neuropathic pain) but is also prescribed off-label for conditions like anxiety and certain mood disorders.
### Understanding Addiction
Addiction involves a complex interplay of physical dependence, psychological cravings, and compulsive drug-seeking behavior despite negative consequences. Not everyone who takes gabapentin will develop an addiction, but certain factors can increase the risk:
1. **Brain Effects**: Gabapentin affects neurotransmitters in the brain, particularly gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which can induce feelings of relaxation and calmness. This mechanism, while therapeutic for anxiety and pain, can also potentially lead to dependency.
2. **Psychological Factors**: Individuals with a history of substance abuse or addiction may be more susceptible to developing problematic use patterns with gabapentin. This is because they might have a heightened sensitivity to the euphoric or sedative effects of the drug.
3. **Dosage and Duration**: Higher doses of gabapentin or prolonged use can increase the likelihood of developing tolerance (needing higher doses to achieve the same effect) and physical dependence (experiencing withdrawal symptoms when the drug is stopped).
### Medical Use vs. Abuse
When gabapentin is prescribed by a doctor and taken as directed, the risk of addiction is generally low. Doctors carefully assess the patient's medical history, current medications, and potential risk factors before prescribing gabapentin. They also monitor patients closely for any signs of misuse or dependency.
### Potential for Misuse
Despite its therapeutic benefits, gabapentin has been increasingly recognized as a drug with potential for misuse. Some individuals misuse gabapentin to enhance the effects of opioids or other substances, or to achieve a sense of relaxation or euphoria. Misuse involves taking higher doses than prescribed, taking it without a prescription, or using it in ways other than directed (e.g., crushing tablets for snorting or injecting).
### Withdrawal and Dependence
Abruptly stopping gabapentin after prolonged use can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, nausea, and pain. This highlights the importance of gradually tapering off the medication under medical supervision when discontinuation is necessary.
### Risk Mitigation
To mitigate the risk of addiction when prescribing gabapentin:
- **Patient Education**: Ensuring patients understand the potential risks and benefits of gabapentin.
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitoring patients for signs of misuse, dependence, or adverse effects.
- **Alternative Treatments**: Considering alternative treatments or therapies for pain and anxiety, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse.
### Conclusion
In conclusion, while gabapentin can be an effective treatment for pain and anxiety when prescribed by a doctor, it is not immune to misuse or addiction, especially in vulnerable populations. Medical supervision, patient education, and careful monitoring are crucial in minimizing the risk of addiction. Patients should always follow their doctor's instructions regarding gabapentin use and consult them if they have concerns about its effects or potential for dependence.",GAD
1199,"It's not very well researched for that purpose. At one time, Neurontin (the original brand name) was a blockbuster drug due to the manufacturer pushing it as having dozens of medical applications beyond the diabetic neuropathy that the FDA approved it for. Due to shady sales practices without the backing of published research, they were handed one of the largest fines the FDA had ever handed down at that time. Now that it is available as a generic drug, there is no money in further research - so none is being done that I can find anywhere.
It did show some promise as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorders, but better medications exist. Due to the opioid crisis the government propaganda has created, which has legitimate doctors running scared to prescibe real pain meds, many doctors are pushing it again for pain. But it's useless for any pain other than nerve pain. Meanwhile other doctors and a few states think it should be controlled due to abuse potential (it's a gross buzz, not worth it).
As for anxiety, there are better proven treatments available than self medicating with it.
It's best to avoid gabapentin unless you have nerve pain or bipolar disorder. It makes you feel hungover unless started at a very low dose then titrated up. It also causes nasty withdrawal symptoms if taken regularly then stopped abruptly - and doctors don't tell patients that.
I've been on it for spinal nerve pain at the maximum dose since 2003… six 600 mg tabs a day, taken two tabs/three times per day. I try to keep it to 2400mg a day when possible. It has a hypnotic effect at high doses and I don't enjoy the feeling.",GAD
1200,"First, be aware that asking strangers on the Internet (including me) for guidance about psychological disorders is not a substitute for professional therapy or psychiatric intervention. You should talk to your doctor and find someone who works with your kind of problem successfully.
But sometimes that’s not available, right? Or it’s not working. So there’s the strangers-on-the-Internet solution.
Here’s an exercise you can try. I don’t have a good name for it — maybe you can come up with one? It’s a sort of meditation process that you can do anywhere, closing your eyes and imagining. It goes like this:
In your imagination, create a room with special properties. The most important property of this room is that it’s yours — this is your room. Anything you bring into this room belongs to you, and the only things in the room are things that you’ve chosen to bring into it.
One of the special properties of this room is that it has no walls. Why? Why does it extend to the ends of the universe in all directions? Because walls are there to keep out the things that don’t belong to you. But since everything in this room belongs to you, there’s just no need for walls — they would only limit what fits in the room, they’d be a nuisance. So no walls. (Since the room is imaginary, this should be simple to achieve.)
Another special property of this room is that you can only bring something into the room by freely choosing to do so: nobody can make you put something into the room, society can’t pressure you to do it, you don’t have to bring anything into the room — you’re free to choose. Also, you can remove something from the room if you change your mind… you’re not forced by your past decisions to keep it.
Your relationship with the things in the room is distinctive: as their owner, they can’t threaten you, they can’t harm you. As their owner, you see them as creative resources — things that you can use to express yourself. They sit there in the room, waiting for the day when you need them or want to study them or decide to sit with them for a while, perhaps. You’re free to come and go, it all belongs to you, and there’s no boundaries to the room.
So let’s say that you do this, and then you look around in your life to ask “what do I choose to bring into my room?” Maybe there’s some people that you like, and you could bring them in? Or maybe some music — old songs, or old movies that you love, etc.
The room starts to fill up with things that you have affection for. But that’s missing the point a bit, too: the point about things in the room is that you’re choosing to make them yours, but that doesn’t mean that you have to like them. Why would you choose something that you don’t like? Why would you bring something that you don’t like into your room? Why would you bring something that scares you into your room?
Remember: when it’s in your room, it can’t harm you. It’s a creative resource, not a threat to your existence or significance or value. It belongs to you, when its in your room. Can you see why you might bring in some unpleasant things to share the space with your old movies and songs and people you like?
Here’s another strange thing about the room: you can bring your self into it: all those beliefs and feelings that you have about yourself, you can bring them into the room if you choose. You don’t have to, of course — the basic rule never changes. But if you choose to do so, you can bring your own past worries and traumas, your strengths and weaknesses, your patterns of failure or proud moments… because there’s no walls for the room, there’s no limit to what it can hold, and there’s no rule that says you can’t put parts of yourself in the room too.
So this is just how it goes, having a room like this: you consider each thing you encounter, and see if you’re going to choose to make it yours. Your freedom is essential here: if you try to bring something into the room without freely choosing it, you find that it won’t fit through the door! (Question: how’d we get door if there’s no walls? Don’t ask, it involves hypermath :) )
There’s a purity to the contents of the room: what does everything have in common? Obviously — you chose it all. You chose to make it yours, and you’re free to use it to express yourself or just leave it be. There’s nothing in the room that you have to “fix” or change, it’s fine as it is. A peaceful acceptance of each thing permeates the space, because that’s how it goes when you choose to take ownership of something. But this kind of acceptance isn’t like “oh, I’m helpless so I accept my fate”, because you’re the owner of this stuff: it’s the raw material of your creative process.
Even if something is a broken piece of crap, and you’ve chosen to bring it to your room, you might find a use for it in your art. Who knows?
Possibility abounds in your room. The more you’ve got, the more possibilities there are. After a while, you start to get some enthusiasm for the process — maybe you start to look out at life and ask “why don’t I just bring the whole freakin’ thing into my room?” You could. There’s no rule that says you can’t.
What about the things that scare you or hurt you? They can’t do that in your room. Is there any reason that the entire universe can’t fit in your room? No, not really. I mean… there’s no authority other than you here.
Another question: who are you, if you have a room that contains everything else and it all belongs to you? Don’t forget: your “identity” is also in that room, along with old VHS tapes and that strange plastic pipe thing you picked up by the side of the road one day. If your self-concepts are just more of the room’s content, is it right to say “that’s who I am?” If that’s who you are, then who owns the room?
This is all just a metaphor, of course. It’s an exercise worth trying, to explore your relationship with the meaning that you give to things. Humans make up meaning, and then “disown” that meaning — which is like relating to something outside of your room. When something’s not in your room, it’s potentially a threat, and you don’t have a sense of ownership that empowers you to relate to it creatively. Bringing something into your room shifts your relationship with that thing, which is what one can do with the meaning they create to restore the natural unity of the relationship.
Someone who’s very anxious has a low appreciation of their own power and the value of their own choices: that generally corresponds to “making meaning that seems outside of myself.” That phrase is difficult to grasp, but the my-room experiment is an easier way to see the same thing.",GAD
1201,"Here are a few suggestions. Consider any that take your fancy.
If you’re close enough to someone, tell them about the thoughts. This may or may not be possible, given that some intrusive thoughts violate social appropriateness; e.g., violent or sexual thoughts. Though if you do have someone suitable who you can trust, that’s great! Then they will be able to put the thoughts in perspective for you. This is difficult when the only reference frame you have is your own. Another person will be able to quell your worries and release all the tension built up by keeping it to yourself.
Get some kind of therapy. CBT might be useful as it allows you to see the connection between thoughts, feelings and actions. Counselling might be a good option, and it offers the same kind of relief as the first suggestion. In any case, some long-term, consistent help would be beneficial.
Start meditating. Start being mindful of your thoughts and your reactions to those thoughts. Intrusive thoughts have power because you react strongly to them. It would be helpful if you could learn to not engage in these thoughts so strongly. By meditating you can learn to observe your thoughts from a more detached vantage point without engaging. This will be extremely difficult at first, but if you persist it’s a very useful tool.
Realise that your intrusive thoughts are not a reflection of who you are as a person. As someone with primarily obsessional OCD and chronic anxiety issues, I realise that sometimes you can have intrusive thoughts which make you feel horrible about yourself. I used to have dreadful thoughts about hurting people close to me, and I used to question what kind of person I was to have such thoughts. But it’s because I am not the kind of person who would act out those thoughts that I had them in the first place! The thoughts kept coming back because I was having such a strong aversive reaction to them. I don’t know if your intrusive thoughts are like this, but if they are, do not let it affect your self-image. They are not a reflection of who you are; if anything, they are a reflection of who you are not. So, a level of acceptance of the thoughts is necessary. This is related to my previous suggestion of not engaging. Just allow them to exist.
This one somewhat conflicts with the above, but can work in conjunction with it. Whenever the thoughts arise, conjure a mental image that stops it. For example, imagine a red cross, or say “no” to the thought. Not in an emotional way, because that will give power to the thoughts, but in a calm way. This is why this method works best in conjunction with (3) and (4). This might work for some, but I can’t say all; it hasn’t worked for me, simply because I got exhausted having to imagine a red cross every thirty seconds! It might for you though.
Somewhat similar to (5), try distracting yourself whenever you have the intrusive thoughts, or whenever you’re worrying in general. The idea is to get yourself out your head. Something that gets you active, something that engages your senses. For instance, you could start exercising/working out. This will also disperse some built up tension. Or you could smell something with a strong fragrance, which engages our oft-underused olfactory system. The point is, some activity sufficiently engaging to leave the worries in the background.
If you haven’t, see your doctor. They might be able to give advice more tailored to you, seeing as though I am simply a stranger on the internet. Also, and this is slightly more controversial, they can prescribe you medication. I believe the safest and most commonly prescribed are SSRIs, which are predominantly used for depression, but also are known to be helpful with anxiety disorders and OCD . I think escitalopram in particular is helpful for anxiety. Beta blockers are another possibility for more serious anxiety. Propranolol is a common example.
I hope some of these will be helpful to you, and anyone else with similar problems. Anxiety is a bitch.",GAD
1202,"Hi, thank you for writing to us.
Intrusive thoughts are unwanted disturbing thoughts that occur from time to time and do not let your mind rest. Some people experience them daily. These thoughts are associated with OCD and anxiety disorders. Here are some ways to stop intrusive thoughts.
1. Do not try to suppress it. When we do this, it results in the exact opposite. Instead of consciously suppressing your thought, try to divert your attention away from it with an engaging activity.
2. A big concern for many people with intrusive thoughts is the fear they may act out on a dark intrusive thought, such as harming someone they love. accept these thoughts as mere thoughts when they arise. Let them pass freely through your mind – recognizing them, but not allowing them to consume you.
3. Often, your thoughts are not entirely random, and your day-to-day interactions may influence them. Keeping a journal of your intrusive thoughts can help you understand patterns over time.
4. If you infuse your life with more positive vibes, you’re less likely to have space for negative ones. integrate a lifestyle change that’s proven to make you feel good and develop it into a consistent habit.
5. Talking through your feelings with someone you trust can be extremely beneficial. By being open and vulnerable about how you’re feeling and what you’re experiencing, you may develop a whole new perspective on your situation.
Hope this helps.

1204,"Ok… everyone has disturbing thoughts… but if they become disturbing one should do something.
They are obsessive thoughts, like the same every time, or similar, or about the same thing? In this case you can’t get them away but saying I wouldn’t think about this - because not thinking of pink elephants is thinking of pink elephants!
Milton Erickson had a great case: a woman had perturbing thoughs of stabbing her son. She didn’t want to go under hypnoses (he used hypnotherapy, actually he was the creator). So what he did? He asked about her son, how old he was, tall, weigh… and then about the knife! What kind of knife would she use, how to stab, where… where - both senses where and where in the boy.
I just google ti find the complete story, I didn’t… but with more time I guess anyone can find.
But the point of story is: while analyzing you don't have the disturbing though!
On the other hand if the toughs are due to anxiety what you should do is to diminish the anxiety, of course. An there is a lot you can do about it:
doing exercise. No need to overdo. Just 2 or 3 times a week, enough to sweat a little - we were made in a world where most (if not all) menaces would mean running or fighting. When menaced your body produces substances to help you do it better, if not used they become toxins which make you anxious. Exercise helps the body eliminating those.
Relax. One easy way is through Progressive Muscular Relaxation (PMR). I bet you can find it on the Net… if not you can by a book How to hypnotize anyone, I know I also was a little… afraid because of the title… but the book is good and has a PMR script - which you can tape yourself, or ask someone to read to you.
Keep busy. Somewhere in Bible it says: unoccupied hands are devil’s hands (or something like it). Well, they get it right. Keeping busy will help - with both anxiety and thoughts.
Find out the case: why are you becoming anxious? Usually is either a special occasion, like exams season, new job, newborn.. ok, no problem that will pass - hopeful not the newborn, but to that you get used! :) Or an unmet human need. You can google about human needs to help you identify the one is going wrong… and if I remember well that book also talks about that…
And above all, if things get hard get help. I guess you don’t want pills for anxiety, so I would see a psychologist. If there is a good hypnotherapist around I would give him a try.",GAD
1205,"Anxiety, Anxiety Disorders & Panic Attacks
Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as emotional distress, pacing back and forth, shortness of breath, pain & fatigue.
It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death.
Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat.
Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation that is only subjectively seen as menacing.
It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fast heart rate, rapid breathing or slow breathing, fatigue and problems in concentration.
Anxiety can be appropriate, but when experienced regularly the individual may suffer from an anxiety disorder.
People facing anxiety may withdraw from situations which have provoked anxiety in the past.
""Anxiety Disorder""
Is a group of mental disorders characterise by significant anxiety and fear. It is different from common Anxiety.
For people who Anxiety Disorder, the worry and fear are constant and overwhelming. It can disable a person to do any thing.
But with treatment many people can manage those feelings and they can work normally.
""Panic Attacks""
Are sudden periods of Intense Fear that may include sweating, palpitations, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness & feeling that something bad is going to happen.
The fear and anxiety during panic attack is so severe that patient is unable to do anything.
The maximum degree of symptoms occurs with in minutes. Typically they will last for 30 minutes, but duration can vary from few seconds to hours.
Panic Attacks themselves are not dangerous. The treatment of Panic Attack is directed toward underlining cause.
Counselling & Breathing training and muscle relaxation techniques are quite help full in these patients.
In serious patients medical treatment is required by clinical Psychiatrist.
Anxiety is due to mind & body reaction to something which can cause fear or apprehension like exams, job interview and disturbances in love affair or relationship, if someone is seriously threatening you or in life threatening situations etc.
Anxiety can also be due to unknown reasons or due to imaginary things which are not real.
This will happen to people who have ‘Anxious Personality’.
Some people will become quite anxious even with trivial problems.
Some people will remain calm and confident even when they are facing big problems in their life. It depends upon Individual Personality.
Anxiety can be due to environment, circumstances, genetics, certain type of health problems, Caffeine ( drinking too much Coffee ), Alcohol, Drugs etc.
Physiologically Anxiety is caused by low levels of a Neurotransmitter called ‘GABA’. It reduces the activity in Central Nervous System ( Brain ).
Anxiety is common in Teenage Youngsters and in Young Adults.
Anxiety is a ‘Protective Mechanism’ given to you by the God. It prepares your mind and body for upcoming situation, threats or challenges in your life.
Anxiety is a normal human mind and body reaction to a difficult or odd situation.
Some people with ‘Anxious Personality’ have more anxiety compare to normal people.
Excessive Anxiety can cause ‘Panic Attacks’ or ‘Nightmares’.
Normally Anxiety will disappear after the difficult situation is over. But in few people it will persist for long time.
For mild to moderate grade of Anxiety Sports, Jogging, Meditation & Yoga exercises will be quite help.
You should concentrate your mind on pleasant thoughts & God when you are doing Meditation.
Reading Books on Positive Thinking & Positive Attitude will also help you.
If your Anxiety is persistent and bothering you too much, then it is advise to consult a qualified Psycho-therapist or a Clinical Psychiatrist.

1206,"Short answer:
How do you overcome anxiety from your thoughts? Accept them. Don’t fight them.
Long answer:
I know this question was asked a while ago but I just came upon it and really think I need to respond. Not only did I suffer from generalized anxiety disorder but I became a counselor and I have worked with thousands who suffer from anxiety as well.
While I appreciate the suggestion that people have made that you need to either question or change your thoughts I have to say that isn’t entirely possible for someone who is experiencing anxiety. Furthermore, it may make matters worse.
Our natural tendency is to try and fight or flee from anxiety when it comes. This makes sense because anxiety is an instinctual reaction that helps to protect us from danger. Imagine you are living in a cave clan 40,000 years ago. You wake up in the morning and walk to the mouth of the cave for some fresh air. You don’t know why but something seems off to you. You pay a bit more attention and notice that the forest is very quiet. No birdsong and no squirrels scurrying through the trees. Now your attention is peaked as you scan the forest from left to right paying careful attention. This is when you notice claw marks 12 ft high on a few trees and an image of a bear pops into your mind. At this point your brain releases adrenaline kicking you into fight or flight mode - preparing you to protect yourself and your clan.
In the above example this is a perfectly rational and reasonable response that may well save your life and the lives of the ones you love. At that moment when you are experiencing this natural mechanism your physiology is taking over to promote action. You can’t just shut that off because chemical processes are already running. You also are not in a position to question if your thoughts are logical. Indeed, doing so might result in personal harm or even death. When there is a mother bear in the area it’s not like you have a lot of time to ponder if you are being reasonable or not.
People who have never truly experienced anxiety don’t realize that the body acts as though there is a bear about even when there isn’t. Your brain releases adrenaline and it gets you terrified and pumped up to fight or fly for your life. Most of us don’t encounter bears in our modern environments (although I do see bears in my neighborhood from time to time) but we do encounter analogs. In other words, we do still have real dangers we face and anxiety is still a useful response to the environment. Being late for work is a good example. If you are late for work too many times you may lose your job and this could directly impact your access to the resources you need for survival. That said, being late for work isn’t a good time to fight or fly for your life.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult for our more primitive survival mechanisms to interpret our modern environments which leaves us feeling anxiety when it isn’t reasonable or helpful. Furthermore, not all people are equal. Some of us (myself included) are more susceptible or prone to it. Some of us (again I’m included) tend to fixate on our thoughts. The first thing I want to say is this is NOT inherently bad. I refer to these people as fixators and they are an important and valuable member of the cave clan. In other words, the group needs fixators to survive. We are the ones that notice anomalies in the environment. Because we are hyper-focused and we fixate on details we notice danger and resources sooner than others. Because of that we can warn our groups to protect them and direct them toward resources useful for survival.
Another thing about fixators is that we tend to be very creative and excellent problem solvers. We can get totally wrapped up in a project spending hours of every day thinking about it in minute detail. We can build and rebuild in our minds and we often figure out how to make something work correctly before we ever start putting hammer to nail. So there is a real and useful strength to fixating on your thoughts. The downside of course is that we can get stuck on negative thoughts for days, weeks, or months. It can be a living hell.
When you say you have anxiety from your thoughts I don’t know what you are talking about. For most people this would be anxiety over thinking you won’t be able to pay the bills or that your companion is cheating on you or contemplating leaving. In other words, most people experience anxiety over thoughts of not being able to procure what they need (resources, help, companionship, social acceptance, etc) in order to survive and thrive. Some people also have anxiety over disturbing thoughts. For example, a new mother who is changing her baby’s diaper might have a fleeting thought of smothering her baby (much more common than you think) and then spend days, weeks, or months obsessing about what it means that she thought something so dreadful.
I’ll assume you are experiencing anxiety in the more common way but regardless, the solution is nearly the same. It lies in accepting yourself, your thoughts, and your reactions. You have to accept them and get comfortable with them before you can start trying to redirect them. I say redirect and not change them. Why? When there is a real danger it makes sense to fight. When there isn’t it doesn’t. So when you feel anxiety over thoughts the last thing you should do is fight them in any way. Asking logical questions to challenge yourself while you are feeling anxiety is only going to intensify the experience. If you ask yourself if your thoughts are logical then you are opening up the door for a debate with yourself and the anxious part of your mind will work hard to give you lots of logical reasons why you should be anxious. You’ll get defensive and desperate. This will cause more adrenaline to be released and the anxiety will become more intense and last longer.
The solution is - don’t fight it. Once you feel anxiety the first you need to do is acknowledge and accept it. This is the only thing you can do. By the time you notice it, there is already adrenaline pumping through your system and you can’t stop that. If you fight and struggle your brain is likely to release more. So, ride the wave. First you acknowledge what is happening. “Oh my God. I think I’m having a panic attack. This sucks.” Then acknowledge the thought. “I’m feeling panic because I’m thinking my girlfriend might be cheating on me.” Then accept what is happening in that moment. “I can feel my hands are shaky and I’m having trouble breathing. This means I am in the middle of panic and I can’t really do anything about it.” Then accept further by accepting yourself. “Sometimes this happens with me. I get stuck on a thought and I can’t get it out of my head. I think the worst and I have a panic attack. It’s just something I do. Sometimes I get stuck on good thoughts and I really like that about myself but right now this is a bad thought and I don’t like it.” Be honest with yourself about how it feels but don’t lie to yourself or fight it. “This sucks. I don’t like the way this feels at all. I’m probably going to be thinking this thought for a bit and feeling this way for an hour or so.” Then allow it to happen. “My brain has triggered the fight or flight response and there is nothing I can do about it. It has done this because it perceives some danger so it’s reacting. I accept that and I’m going to let my instincts do what they do. I’m going to trust myself and think of my anxiety as a friend who has come to help. They are trying to protect me so I am not going to fight them.” Then do what you need to do. “Okay, so I’m going to let my instincts focus on the danger but right now I have to get to work. I don’t like the way I feel but I’m capable of driving with shaky hands and a tight chest just as well as without.”
Okay here is the logic. Typically when we struggle against anxiety is makes the part of our brain which is worried double down. It makes it focus more on the scary thought. When you do this it causes your anxiety to go on and on. Your brain will fight with you and will release more and more adrenaline in subsequent waves. This is a part of your brain which you do NOT consciously control and it’s trying to convince you of the danger so the anxiety will last for hours if you fight it. When you notice that first wave and you allow it to happen, just wash over you, you are basically agreeing not to fight with yourself and go with the flow. You are agreeing with that part of your mind which is trying to warn you. You accepting the warning. This stops your brain from fighting with you and it doesn’t keep the anxiety going. You can usually ride it out in 30–60 minutes.
This does 3 things. First, it decreases the duration of each anxiety attack. Second, after a couple weeks (as your nervous system heals) it will start to decrease the frequency of attacks. Lastly, you’ll be training yourself to manage anxiety and with practice you will start to see more appropriate, reasonable, and logical responses naturally over time. In other words, your brain will start to figure out when there is real danger and when there isn’t. This doesn’t mean you won’t ever have irrational responses. You will. I still do. They just won’t happen as often and won’t have the same power over you.
If you would like some tools for prevention, I recommend you keep your mind engaged all the time. I always have a project I am working. I try to pick projects that challenge me so I can keep my mind fixating on something creative that I enjoy. This doesn’t mean I have to be doing the project all hours of the day. In fact, if I only do a little bit each day (less than an hour - maybe only 10 min) it draws it out longer and let’s me think about it more. If it is a woodworking project I might build and rebuild it many different times in my thoughts. I will test each build in my mind and try to weed out all the problems by coming up with good solutions. I find that my fixating mind just automatically wants to work these problems out. Give yourself something positive upon which to fixate and you should see a lot of improvement over time. You’ll also have some tangible evidence of your creativity. I crochet hats and give them to my friends. I build things out of wood (including the desk upon which I now type this message) that enrich my life.
The better you come to understand yourself and how your brain works the more you will realize, as I have, that the ability to fixate and focus thoughts is an advantage to be treasured - not a curse to be despised. It’s just a matter of learning how to direct the fixating to something you desire.
I wish you all the best!",GAD

→ First of all always BELIEVE and KNOW that every situation has a solution. Never be afraid to share your worries with your close ones.
→ The very best step for the situation we are having here is that you should step forward and consult a psychiatrist.
→ S/he will assess the situation, support and guide you and you can totally trust her/him because there is an ethical principal of Confidentiality.
→ The major role will be yours. Remember the first thing I said… To know and believe that every situation has solution. This is the biggest medicine to the situation. The human body responds and heals much faster and better if one truly believes in the process of healing. And this has a scientific term called PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY.

1208,"I can relate. One thing that helps is exercise.. when the thoughts start coming, get up and get moving. If you can, play something fun and exhausting like racquetball. I can’t take the meds (have tried 7 of them with bad side effects) but if they work for you, see you doctor too. Also avoid sugar and wheat and dairy… sometimes they make things worse. You probably have a genetic trait that runs in your family … even back further than your immediate family. The thoughts will never go away completely, but if you exercise and eat right and keep busy they will not take over your life.",GAD
1209,"Here are 9 ways to do so that have been shown to work.
1. Take a deep breath.
2. Accept that you’re anxious.
3. Realize that your brain is playing tricks on you.
4. Question your thoughts.
5. Use a calming visualization.
6. Be an observer — without judgment.
7. Use positive self-talk.
8. Focus on right now.
9. Focus on meaningful activities.

1210,"Coping with intrusive thoughts in generalized anxiety disorder involves mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and professional guidance. For a more comprehensive understanding, check out my dedicated Quora Profile on Managing Intrusive Thoughts and Anxiety.",GAD
1211,"You'll have to control your anxiety first!
Until your anxiety is fully under control, it is going to be difficult to stop disturbing thoughts altogether. But in the meantime, consider the following:
· Don't Be Afraid: Remember, thoughts are simply thoughts, even the most psychologically healthy people have the occasional strange thought, it is your reaction to them which is the problem. Change your reaction to “no reaction” and try to learn to smile at these thoughts.
· Write Them Out: The mind relaxes on trying to remember things when it knows they're in a permanent place, so when you write them out you effectively tell your brain it doesn't need to focus on them as much.
· Mental Distractions : Distractions are an incredibly important part of coping with stress. Start immersing yourself in normal activities (e.g. spending time with friends and family, listening to music, exercise, work, etc) to keep your brain as active as possible.",GAD
1212,"Every day we bear the risk of experiencing unsettling thoughts. There are thousands of thoughts a day, and sometimes we don't even realize they are there. Intrusive thoughts are enough to prevent us from paying attention to them. Our daily worries make up 67% of our thinking. We experience 18% of bad, unacceptable, or unpleasant thoughts. Disturbing intrusive thoughts make up 13% of our daily thinking process.
Understand why intrusive thought disturbs you
Intrusive ideas cling to something that makes a lot of sense to you. That is what causes such confusion in your nervous system. It may be your family, animals, your work, or your reputation. Unwanted thoughts naturally cause you to fear, disgust, or vigilance. If you react negatively, your thoughts will look even stronger. Understanding your core values will help you understand your unwanted thoughts. You will understand why they scare you and why you react negatively to them. Ultimately, you can turn those obsessions into something you can just go without.
Participate in intrusive ideas
Self-help can minimize the damage caused by intrusive thoughts. This includes paying attention to the trail of intrusive thoughts. At the moment of unwanted thought, you may react to them as if they were real. You can always be afraid to act on these obsessions. Accepting intrusive thoughts is the key to dealing with them. If you admit them, they have no meaning to you.
3. Don't be afraid to think
One of the coping mechanisms for coping with intrusive thoughts is avoidance. If intrusive thoughts are based on fear, it is important not to push them away. Talk to yourself and tell yourself that it's okay. Accept that persistent thoughts are there and don't try to resist the experience. You may feel tension throughout your body, but it passes by. Escaping and trying to hide from anxious thoughts with your anxiety modifies it.
4. Don't be too personal about intrusive thoughts
The idea of OCD is not realistic, but we still tend to believe them to the extent that we apologize for never happening. It is important not to mistake the idea you have for who you are. Letting go of thoughts is what we always do. If it's a worrying idea, it shouldn't make any difference.
5. Stop changing behavior
Obsessive-compulsive behavior can epitomize itself when trying to change who you are based on the intrusive thoughts you are experiencing. The idea of OCD is not realistic, so changing the reality and trying to avoid them is not the solution. Compulsions are mental actions taken to gain some comfort or reassurance about those ideas. Somewhere in your head, you believe that relentless hand washing can get rid of bad thoughts forever.
6. Cognitive Therapy
People with intrusive thoughts due to OCD or complex PTSD benefit from the practice of mindfulness, but usually require treatment beyond self-help. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is 70% effective in patients with OCD. CBT requires patients to confront fear. This helps to relieve the patient's obsessions. It is essentially total detoxification of mind treatments.
7. Medication
OCD Rumination and anxiety are closely related. If the drug can relieve your anxiety, it will probably reduce your contemplative urge. Anxiety = Rumination = Panic = Depression Intrusive thoughts are harmless but can be harmful depending on how you react to them. Drugs for intrusive thinking have received various reviews. There is an opportunity to relax the nervous system and support overall development. On the other hand, it can lead to prescription drug addiction and aggravate the situation.",GAD
1213,"Your anxiety causes those thoughts to come but in fact that very anxiety stems from unfounded beliefs and exaggerated fears. What you need to counter are those wrong beliefs. You need to probe and look deep into your mind and question your beliefs.
Do I really need to worry about this?
Does a reasonable man thinks this way?
what is the worst that can happen?
So what?
What if you just accept everything?
Accept your troubles and see them as opportunities! Can you change your perspective?
You will feel so light once you get into the mess in your head and deentangle those thoughts.

1214,"You have to realize there are certain truths that govern life on Earth. As a person struggling with PTSD and depressive disorder with a moderate case of anxiety to boot, there are certain things that, when viewed through the right lens make this life an unforgettable experience.
No one cares. It's not so much about people being assholes as it is they are suffering too. Everyone is much too concerned about what going on in their own lives to give a fuck about what's going on with you. Facebook has become an emotional dump where people talk about their feelings and happenings in their lives with 'friends' they rarely, if ever see in real life. So everyone puts their best mask on and fakes concern with motivational quotes and Bible scripture. But really, no one gives a shit. This is just a place people can pretend to be the person they always want to be but don't have the courage to. And that's not necessarily a knock on them. In contemporary America, everyone is certain to be fucked up in some way with the garbage our system produces- corporate criminals, political corruption, celebrity worship, death panels masquerading as healthcare, the drug crisis, climate change, racism, sexism, ageism, sexual shame, mass shootings, sexual predators around every corner, money worship, religious extremism, etc, etc. Everyone is much too miserable to give two shits about your relationship status. Trust me, you become much more attuned to your own spirit when you learn the art of not giving a shit what anyone thinks of you.
Everyone and everything around you is dying. Every moment of every day, your body is dumping millions of old, used cells back to the Earth. It is said that it takes roughly five to seven years for an organ, such as your liver, to completely replicate itself, but due to oxidation, free radicals and a whole lot of other toxic shit you get exposed to every day, you age because of this process. Finally, your body slowly starts losing the ability to make healthy cells due to it's inability to cleanly break down macronutrients like protiens down correctly. The result of this could be a wide range of ailments you could and will develop as you get older. And guess what??? A lot of it is genetic. Yes, from the day you were born, your body already had a blueprint for how it should die. But truthfully, most of us don't even make it THAT FAR. Think about all the deaths you read about on the internet everyday. The mass shootings, celebrity suicides and natural disasters you see in the news each week. This planet might be our home, but its creations are much more likely to kill us before our own built-in self destruction device does. And if there are humans still living on planet Earth five billion years from now everyone is going to die at roughly the same time. Sol will exhaust it's hydrogen core and start creating heavy metals like carbon. Not having enough mass to go supernova, it will expand into a red giant. Earth's oceans will evaporate and Earth's protective ozone layer will be destroyed, causing our blue green planet to become a living hell. All plant and animal life will die and every trace of our civilization will be annihilated. Eventually Sol will become so big it will consume most, if not all of the inner planets in the solar system and possibly eject one or two more (possibly Jupiter and or Neptune) out into deep space. As Agent Smith would say, it is inevitable. Simple, yet profound. When you let go of the need to control that which cannot be controlled, you become liberated from it. That's not to say you shouldn't be afraid of death, but to remember it's importance- to secure the future for that which is yet to come. You are not alone in it.

1216,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.

The idea is to unlock a “third party” perspective allowing for a thorough assessment of the state.

But you need to change the way you react to it.
So.
If I had a really bad thought. Kept thinking about it. Made me have heart palpitations then panic came along. Then you think about it again then think about panicking then think about that thought all your doing is adding fuel to the fire.
It might be easy saying this but I had to learn this way.
Challenge that thought or let it pass.
So what you had that thought. Doesn't mean anything. I could have a thought of killing my cat tonight. Doesn't mean im going to do it. Just a stupid thought.
The more you change the way you react the less you will panic. You can do this. Have faith.

Get therapy

When he/she is in depression, they may feel lazy and exhausted always ! This might lead to incomplete works and also increases your ‘procrastination’ .
By procrastinating, you might have that urge to complete your work but you'll not be able to do it! This will result in thinking about the consequences that you might face due to your procrastination and you'll overthink a lotttt!
Trust me , depression & anxiety together are the worst thing !!! I'm telling this in my own experience.

I'll tell you how to overcome this. Give yourself some time.
After my exams got over , we had holiday for a month! Idk in what situation you're in now but distract yourself. Just travel and explore things. If you can't travel to long distance cities/town , you can even travel to the nearest place .
If you're a pet lover then spend some time with your dog /cat . Because animals can understand us more than humans do! Provide them some food to stray dogs/cats . They'll feel happy and they'll definitely shower their love on you. Trust me, the love which all these animals shower on use will bring temporary happiness inside us.
DO NOT LISTEN TO SAD / BREAK-UP SONGS!!!! This is because while listening to these kinda songs, you'll start to cry for no reason and it will trigger your negative emotions. Don't listen these songs for atleast 2–3 months . Listen only feel-good songs.
Have some food in your favourite restaurant (if affordable) or in your fav cafe
Start loving yourself for who you're !
I gave some tips from my own experience and this is how I overcame depression & anxiety. I know it will be very hard to do these stuffs but trust me it will be helpful! If you need any support then , never hesitate to ask to your friends/family ! Try the above tips , if it doesn't work for you then go for counseling. When your depression is in extreme condition you might feel like “COMMITTING SUICIDE” !!! But don't do that . If you have these kinda thoughts , speak to someone whom you trust the most!

1223,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
1224,"Umm… Yeah. I actually find that they go hand in hand unfortunatly. But im not a doctor. You should probably talk to one to confirm and see if theres some more things you can actually do about it. Sometimes with like seasonal depression you can try and sit in front of this special lamp, and it takes some trial and error- because you sit too close to this light and it can bring on an anxiety attack- which means your sitting too close. Now, this only works for some people with seasonal depression and probably wont work with depression that is more consistant and severe. However, it can also help prove the point you need to be on medication. St.johns wart is also a good place to start tosee if that helps. If it doesnt then that marks another reason why you should be on better medication and therapy. Coming from someone who hasschizophrenia- these methods did not help me, and for good reason. Either way, I hope this helps. There are also breathing excersises that can help with panic attacks. I would try those as well before trying to say that you need to be on medication for that as well..

As is something that come unexpected and last a few minutes up to 20 minutes. And is not happening every day. If not a twice per month.
Started right after my husband passed away. Come unexpectedly. How do I know I have it? I recognize it. Start out of nowhere. If I'm in a place where I had to wait for a while longer in line. If I'm looking at something specific ( will not tell) usually I started to move one of my legs non stop for a minute. I can control the leg movement. When I start to move it and when to stop it. Is my way to cope with that sudden anxious feeling. Like when you rock slowly back and forth a child to console. I think moving the leg is the same for a anxious person. Is a copying mechanism.
I had witnessed people do this leg movement in public and in restaurants . A family was having dinner. The male in the family shacked his legs non stop. Looks out of place to be doing that.
Well, is a sign the person do not like to wait, is in a hurry for something or is anxious. I have days when I feel great. I had days when all seems fine, and later on in the same day . I started to felt anxious out of nowhere. Without nothing triggers that.

Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.

General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.

Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious.

I’d say ASD and anxiety is… fun. I make a lot of mistakes, and then get cripplingly humiliated about it. Conversations? Ha! Normal friendships? Ha! I’m lucky to have been introduced to eclectic hobbies like D&D and theatre at such a young age, or else I might never have found anywhere to cozy my way in. I wouldn’t say I ‘fit in’, but no one really does. I think.
Is it the worst combination to have? Maybe. I don’t know. My autism is pretty light, but my anxiety is exceedingly heavy, and I’ve been medicated for years now. But personal experience says that growing up with autism and anxiety is a truly backbreaking form of hell.
In my experience, though, if you have a natural inclination to see the best in people, the ‘worst’ diagnosis combos can turn out the best people. I hope I’m among them.

1243,"Yes, it is possible to have both anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) simultaneously. This co-occurrence is relatively common and can complicate treatment. When both disorders are present, it's crucial for healthcare providers to assess symptoms carefully and develop a comprehensive treatment plan that may include therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Addressing both anxiety and depressive symptoms simultaneously improves overall mental health outcomes.

1249,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1250,"Managing symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) often involves a combination of therapeutic approaches and lifestyle changes. Some strategies include:
1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Learning to identify and challenge negative thought patterns that contribute to anxiety.
2. Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques: Practicing mindfulness, deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety.
3. Regular Exercise: Engaging in physical activity can help reduce stress and improve mood.
4. Healthy Lifestyle: Maintaining a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and limiting caffeine and alcohol intake can positively impact anxiety symptoms.
5. Stress Management: Learning effective time management, setting realistic goals, and practicing assertiveness can help manage stressors.
6. Social Support: Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional comfort and reduce isolation.
7. Medication: Consult a psychiatrist about the potential benefits of anti-anxiety medications.

1257,"Hi, thank you for writing to us.
GAD can be very troublesome to live with. GAD causes you to worry about situations endlessly and uncontrollably. Chronic Anxiety Neurosis can be another name for it. The person with GAD has no control over his/her anxiousness. They constantly worry and fear about situations that are not that huge and sometimes even about things in future. They seem to express a feeling of helplessness and inability to calm themselves. It is very different from regular anxiety, which goes away after some time. This is much more serious than that and can cause several problems in daily life.
Symptoms- The commonly observed symptoms of people with Generalized anxiety disorder is irritability, fatigue, difficulty in sleeping and sometimes insomnia. Another common symptom is difficulty in concentrating because anxiety and constant worry doesn't leave you alone. Anything you do, there is a continuous tension building up in the thought process. Repeated stomach aches and diarrhoea is also experienced. Increasing heart rates, muscle tension, sweaty palms, shaking, numbness in some body parts are also the symptoms to keep in mind.
Causes- There can be several reasons why a person develops GAD, and having it transferred through genes is one of them. Childhood trauma is a reason for developing it. Also, the most common reason is the environment. If you are in a stressful environment for a long time, such as in a workspace or have illness issues, then you are likely to develop it. Excessive use of tobacco and caffeine will make anxiety more serious.
It can be treated through cognitive Behavioural therapy and medications.

1258,"I have 3 intertwining anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder, and Derealization/Depersonalization), so my symptoms often overlap and feed into each other. Also, physical and psychological symptoms often go together, but I will try to narrow them down to be more specific. These are some of my psychological symptoms:
Overthinking (worrying about the past/future). I can’t stop thinking about things that worry me and I will over-analyze an event, moment, or comment to the point of even having an anxiety attack.
“Fortune-telling” (worrying about the future). This symptom is what happens when you start imagining all the bad things that could happen and goes along with overthinking. It usually happens before I go out or meet with friends. At my worst, my thinking could get so negative that I find myself not going places because of this.
Feeling extremely irritable, angry, restless. I can usually tell when my anxiety is acting up when I feel uncomfortable for “no reason”, (but the reason is that I have anxiety). When I’m like this, it’s easier for me to get overwhelmed and I often have the need to withdraw from socializing.
Feeling “on edge” or jumpy, getting scared easily.
“Automatic thinking”. Most of the psychological symptoms stem from “automatic thoughts,” which are negative thoughts or assumptions that quickly pop-up in your mind and leave you with a severe feeling of dread or make you apprehensive to do things.
Lack of concentration. Not being able to understand people/things around you because you have so much going on in your mind.
These are a few that I could think of. Although it’s really hard to deal with all aspects of anxiety, what makes it harder is when the physical symptoms accompany the psychological ones. So you don’t only think certain things, but you feel certain ways when you think them.
I hope this helped.",GAD
1259,"That’s a broad question.
Anxiety ranges in intensity from a stressed-out overwhelmed feeling to a full-blown panic attack that sends you to the emergency room for a heart check.
Different types of anxiety include
generalized anxiety (GAD),
panic,
social anxiety,
phobias such as fear of flying,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Anxiety is both emotional and physical.
You feel the emotion of anxiety and you feel the physical sensation of being anxious.
Your body and mind are connected, and each affects the other: your biochemistry can alter your mood and your mood can alter your biochemistry.
Anxiety is heightened fear. When fear provokes the fight, flight, or freeze response, it commands your body to perform specific chemical processes that are meant to keep you safe in times of danger. Some of the resulting physical changes are felt as the symptoms of anxiety.
Anxiety’s physical manifestations are different for different people. One person might sweat, another person might have diarrhea, another constipation. Your particular body and the intensity of your anxiety will determine your symptoms.
For more on the emotional and physical symptoms of anxiety, and anxiety books and other resources, check out this post:
What are Anxiety Symptoms?
We feel anxiety emotionally and we feel anxiety physically. Anxiety symptoms can be both emotional and physical. It can drive you to act in a demanding or irrational way as you attempt to get relief from the fear. Or it can narrow your world as you reduce your exposure to situations that stimulate the fear.

1261,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

I overthink. I think of many things and I am prone to think about past and future, and I am usually very sad when I think of past, and for future-well I try to control it in terms that I try to avoid some possible obstacles and perceived dangers (even if danger is barely possible)
I think of death too much, and what is going on after death
I am restless and fidgety and I cant sit on one spot, and I need to take a walk often.
I have health concerns, even that I am most likely healthy.

I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
1267,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD

1269,"I'm going to give you the straightest, best answer you'll find on this site and I'll tell you why- I had severe social anxiety since adolescence and have (mostly) successfully overcome it.
Let me reveal to you a little about my history. I was a bright kid, had a pleasing personality, was an okay athlete, and a fairly good musician. But I was wracked by a weird thing I couldn't name: I would never raise my hand in class, never mind attend school dances, proms, or parties.
It was only later, when I became a psychiatrist, that I learned I was suffering from anxiety, specifically social anxiety.
People who don't experience it will never understand, and never understand the crippling nature of this disorder.
It's late, and I don't have the energy to find the research sources to back up my statements, but I've researched everything I'm going to tell you. I'm not practicing medicine right now, so please take this as friendly advice.
(1) Social anxiety is almost certainly genetic in origin. I'm betting your family didn't talk much because you almost certainly have other family members who suffer also. If you look at your relatives, you'll find at least a few who are very private or shy and have somehow accommodated to their disorder.
(3) Talk therapy doesn't help that much. In my opinion (and I treated hundreds of people with social anxiety) social anxiety is not so much a psychological problem as a genetic predisposition. Just like it's really hard to talk yourself out of OCD, or panic attacks, or phobias, talk therapy won't do much (if anything) for social anxiety.
(4) Think about what social anxiety is. What is happening to you is that in social situations you are feeling judged (and monitored). This is an unconscious reaction (and, from an evolutionary standpoint, not pathological at all-but that's another sub...

1271,"By getting counselling while at university (because it’s often free at these places).
And within the sessions, I opened up about some really deep stuff that I doubt many people would have gone through only to realise that for the most part I was fine and wasn't going crazy.
I haven't had very much anxiety for 9 months now and I doubt it will develop again. But through having major anxiety and depression of various forms to becoming mentally stable again i have realised that there's mostly an issue with the thought process in how you go about thinking about things.
It sounds kind of obvious to those with it but it’s quite a major issue when you programme yourself to think in a manner where you’re almost always thinking way too much about something and very deeply which can bring up certain things that may frighten you and because of that I ended up searching on the internet using loaded questions that were sort of creating these self-fulfilling prophecies about worse case scenarios that you think are going to happen or are happening to you and that everyone else is too stupid to think about it in enough detail to realise that there's something wrong.
It may sound stupid to people with the anxiety disorders at first or you may realise it but not give it enough credit but you do over think things way too much and way too often. Not vice vera.
And it’s weird because you get these thought processes that trick yourself (almost unconsciously) into rooting out potential problems within your life and within yourself and inflate the probability of it happening just because the threat could potentially exist even though the chances of it happening are quite often so minute it's negligible.
My main advice would be (from 5/6 years of personal experience of previously having it)
Seek counselling (it’s the best thing I ever did) and actually talk about the problem no matter how ridiculous it sounds or if it makes you teary because they really are used to and trained with handling this sort of thing.
Acknowledge that the anxiety is coming from within the disorder itself and not the things you are anxious about, therefore you be looking into other peoples experiences of anxiety, realise the restrictive thought processes of what you got through that makes you anxious, how they got better and etc rather than assuming the thing you are anxious about is the cause.
Quit caffeine (or at least reduce it) this might sound ridiculous but for myself and others, caffeine really does induce or at least exacerbate anxiety mentally and physiologically for that reason it’s best to reduce it until you’re better. It doesn't necessarily get rid of the anxiety disorder but it does help in managing the anxiety.
Don’t be afraid to start thinking differently (by challenging and not following through with the anxious behaviour) in a way that breaks the anxious thought loops. It sounds ridiculous but the anxious thought patterns feel normal and almost addictive and to think otherwise can seem scary or dangerous when that's simply not the case realistically.",GAD
1272,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1273,"Social Anxiety has become a very grave problem. There are many people who suffer from it. CBD oil is good for social anxiety. It can help curb anxiety with its naturally derived hemp extracts that are anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic, anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant in nature.
There are many other forms of CBD infused products like gummies, beverages, honey, balms, lotions, etc.
CBD oil can also help alleviate pain, stress, depression, inflammations, nausea, etc. It will boost your overall health and wellness.
Kindly consult your physician before use.",GAD
1274,"Yes, I was growing and smoking it every couple of hours for 15 years, it turned me into an idiot. I would only get high in the morning when I awoke and when I was tired at night. All through the day I would smoke but not really get high, it just turned me stupid an idiot. Eventually the police caught me. And to be honest I'm grateful they did. Even now my memory is terrible. Occasionally I might have a puff, but if I smoke more than a few tokes. I get seriously anxious and self conscious. It affects people in different ways. For some it's a helpful happy weed. But for me, it was the Devils lettuce.",GAD
1275,"I have severe anxiety. Basically I am constantly operating under the belief that everything I do and say is wrong and ugly and people are scrutinizing and watching me and I am hideous and strange and don't know how to act. It takes a tremendous amount of effort to be in groups of any kind for me unless I am around friends I feel truly at ease with. These things have helped me:
Challenging my illness
Living with anxiety makes small things ten times harder. Try not to let it hold you back. There are steps, meds, and coping skills that make it not so debilitating. I take an anti anxiety med, which makes interactions less anxiety inducing. I sometimes purposefully put myself in situations where I face my deep anxiety so I feel like I am in control, not controlled by it. I sing in a band and regularly sing in front of people even though sometimes I shake so hard I can't hold my notes. For a long time i worked in a restaraunt even though talking to every different table was exhausting, and interactions with people were as much work as the stress of a busy restaraunt. Doing these things take me out of my comfort zone and help me learn to cope better.
Acknowledging it and being ok with it
Having social anxiety is not bad or weird or wrong. I think a good majority of people with social anxiety actually are very social and care a lot, which is why they have intense, heightened reactions to socializing. They are deeply in tune with how they respond to and are responded to by other humans, and sometimes too in tune and hyper vigilant. My anxiety will sometimes hold me back. That's ok.
Authentic relationships
The thing that's healed me a lot is talking to other people who feel and act just like I do, and finding friends who accept me fully even if they don't share my social fear. Those are the people I open up to about my illness and who I'm not so scared around. I'm honest with them when my brain goes haywire, and I'll ask them for a perspective. Be cautious, because some people will be hurtful about what's going on with you, but don't be completely closed off because there are people in your life you can open up to. The few people who love you for who you are are like therapy when you spend every day scared of people.",GAD
1276,"It's different for everyone honestly. It could be meds, counseling , meditation, a combination of things.
what works for me was when I got put on meds for my panic attacks, then I also take meds for my anxiety throughout the day. I got a weighted blanket as a gift last year, and I had seen them around but I wasn't sure if it would help or not so I didn't get myself one. They are kind of pricey. When I got one as a gift, and tried it for the first time, it worked wonders for me. They make you feel secure and let your body Relax.
you have to try different things and see what helps you. Because you are the only one who truly knows your body. And everybody is unique. Good luck ! 🍀",GAD
1277,"You have a lot going on. Puberty, life, changes, hormones: it can turn the world into a scary place.
Try to eat fresh food you prepare yourself. Fruit, veggies, there is a whole world of great food out there. As a rule of thumb: the less processed, the better. Your body needs good quality food to grow. Pizza? Make it yourself. Fastfood? Skip and make your own sweet potato fries. Watch Jamie Oliver on the internet - he has loads of inspiration for you!
Walk outside in a park or nature for at least 30 minutes a day. Preferably with someone.
Dance, sing, move on music. It'll lift your mood.
Meditate for a bit. Do yoga.
Stay away from weed and cigarettes and alcohol for now. Take a course in something you like.
Life can be beautiful. I hope you allow yourself to see it. If you want to talk/write about it - let me know. I am happy to litwn to you and am an experienced mom.
All the best to you!",GAD
1278,"A 150% YES YES YES!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT SO IS. YOU NEED TO BEAT THE DISORDER not the ANXIETY. Talk to your therapist or if you don’t have one GO AND FIND ONE.
You need to find your deep factors which are the cause of this horrible thing. Even if you don’t think is, THERE IS! YOU HAVE TO FIND IT.
Think about why did your first panic attack or why did you felt so uncomfortable? That is your factor.
YOU CAN BEAT IT.
I PROMISE.
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.
ANXIETY DISORDER IS 100% CURABLE.",GAD
1279,"Social anxiety disorder let me simplify it by using an example….
You are alone, go to school daily seeing a lot of peers having a group of friends who just chill and enjoy each other. You feel like what is problem with me!? Why can't I make friends like them! They just ignore my talks, not even say me hi. Day goes boring and thoughts come in your negative side of your brain. Which leads to anxiety and depression. It was a story but in reality it is happening more and more. Our world is lacking the mental illness cure
Social anxiety disorder means you are left alone and not be social anymore, having no friends which I think bieng alone is better than a group of friends. You can explore your life freely enjoy yourself. Make good friend a single friend is enough who thinks about you and respect your character. You know nowadays good friends are like finding a needle in dump. Once you found a rare friend, next you will be successful
Mark my words- Don't worry you have no friend at all or just one as one friend can change your character and behaviour for lifetime. Depends upon you that which typo friend you made. Choice yours good or bad. If no then wait because nature has a good perspective",GAD
1280,"In my opinion, these are the three big symptoms:
Unexplained fear and worry. The body goes into a fight and flight reaction, even though the person hasn’t left the house or done anything threatening. The mere thought of facing the day brings heart palpitations, shaking and feeling shut off from anything good. Essentially, you are trapped in your head with these obsessional thoughts that tell you everything will not be fine, but awful. You find yourself stuck in fear. It is hard to get out of that mindset as it is like a loop replaying in your head.
Scattered thoughts—inability to focus. The anxious person is basically in overdrive, so details like names, bringing something to work, going to appointments, homework assignments and even what do I do next become hard to remember. A lot of memory skills fall apart because so much energy goes into dealing with the stressful situation at hand.
Self soothing habits that are counterproductive. Some people binge eat when they are anxious. Some drink to take the edge off. Some pull their hair out as there is something comforting in the ritual. Some can’t sit still, so their legs shake or they play with their hair or get up, walk, then sit down. Some keep scrolling their phone or tablet, looking for something to calm themselves down. Some do things that society initially rewards, like obsessively cleaning their house or attending about 8 cultural events in a day. This is because they cannot sit with their feelings, so there is a need to do something—anything. It helps to keep the anxious thoughts at bay.
These are things I have seen in others, plus I have trouble with scattered thoughts and poor concentration when I feel very stressed. Usually around the close of the semester, I begin forgetting basic information. Since I expect this, I write things down to remember, or I set my phone to remind me of key events. I never realized this was a symptom of anxiety until I read it in a book and had an aha moment. When I have a lot of deadlines and people depending on me to perform, I see my life as disorderly and out of control. It usually passes once the stressful period has ended.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder sucks.",GAD
1281,"I tried 1 CBD Oil that tasted like I was licking the floor of the barn - didn't use it a 2nd time, so don't know if that one would have worked for me. Tried a 2nd one that I got from my local health food co-op and that one did nothing for me (and mo return policy). Tried once more ONLY because if the 60 day money back guarantee, even if the bottle is empty.
SO glad I did! Before CBD, I slept for 1-2 hours, then I'd be awake for 1-2 hours. That was my pattern all night, every night, for 13 years! With this CBD, I slept 9 hours straight the first night! It's been nearly 2 years since I started taking it, and I sleep 6-8 hours every night and wake up feeling refreshed. If I wake up in tdee middle of the night, I get back to sleep quickly!
And no more feelings of anxiousness - even when I'm driving over bridges. We were in Florida this winter and I even drove over the Tampa Skyway Bridge with no problems …. several times, so I knows it wasn't a fluke!
Try it! Find the right one for you!",GAD
1282,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
1283,"Anxiety is a feeling of vague uneasiness, fear and worry about what may happen. It is a very common emotional reaction to situations fraught with uncertainty. Anxiety becomes symptomatic of a disorder when the duration and intensity of episodes of anxiety enhance to a level significantly beyond what is normally expected in a situation, and the manifestation and consequences of episodes of anxiety are significantly harmful for the self and others.
There is no single disorder named anxiety disorder. According to the DSM V (Diagnostic Statistical Manual, the most widely adhered diagnostic manual worldwide, by the American Psychiatric Association), the term is used to refer to all disorders where the main debilitating symptom is anxiety. DSM V lists the following anxiety disorders:
Separation Anxiety Disorder
Selective Mutism
Specific Phobia
Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)
Panic Disorder
Panic Attack (Specifier)
Agoraphobia
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder
Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition
Other Specified Anxiety Disorder
Unspecified Anxiety Disorder

According to ICD 10 (International Classification of Diseases by WHO) anxiety disorders are of the following types:
Agoraphobia - Without panic disorder/With panic disorder
Social phobias
Specific (isolated) phobias
Other phobic anxiety disorders
Phobic anxiety disorder, unspecified
Other anxiety disorders
Panic disorder [episodic paroxysmal anxiety] - Moderate .01 Severe
Generalized anxiety disorder
Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder
Other mixed anxiety disorders
Other specified anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorder, unspecified

Each one of the listed disorders has its own specific symptoms. The following may be identified as broadly characterizing most anxiety disorders:
1. Anxiety/Fear: The most important feature is an overwhelming sense of worry, tension and impending doom. In generalized anxiety disorders, the cause of the anxiety is not identified or vaguely understood. In specific disorders or phobias, the fear stems from a specific stimulus or situation - such as birds, open spaces, fire etc.
2. Fear reactions/Panic when facing the dreaded condition: When a person with anxiety disorder is in an anxiety -inducing situation, he/she responds with a number of physiological and psychological reactions - activation of the autonomic nervous system, fear, jumpiness and so on. In extreme cases, it may lead to panic attacks - where the person has an overwhelming feeling of impending doom, resulting in intense fear, clouding of judgment or even loss of consciousness.
3. Tendency to avoid the dreaded situation/stimulus: Anxiety disorders like phobias are characterized by an overwhelming need to avoid the dreaded situation - even at the cost of severe restrictions on normal living.
4. Lucidity: Except for some severe cases, anxiety disorders are usually characterized by a sense of lucidity - i.e., the client himself/herself sees that the anxiety/fear is illogical and unhealthy. While this does not imply that the symptoms are controllable or wishfully displayed, it does make anxiety disorders more amenable to psychotherapy. The cognitive-behaviour therapy is one line of therapy particularly successful in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
Hope this helps for a start.",GAD
1284,"I see it manifest in a few ways:
A feeling of doom or dread, as if something disproportionately bad is going to happen. For example, you feel you’re going to be fired or audited and go to jail or your car is going to bottom out because the shocks have been squeaky. You are 10 steps ahead of your problems, already envisioning a worst case scenario as if that’s a sure thing.
Feeling racy — a feeling of restlessness washes over your body. You may also hear a ringing in your ears. You can’t get comfortable. You are on heightened alert. Adrenaline flows. Eventually you crash.
Dead eyes or viewing the world like you’re a ghost. A feeling like you have narrow vision and everything around you is just happening. You stare ahead and don’t really SEE anything. You can’t see art, for example.
These feelings have definitely affected me from time to time. Maybe all the time. It’s affected my work history — I start to get paranoid after awhile and polish up my resume and look for something else, even though, in reality, I shouldn’t be worried.",GAD
1285,"Anxiety is a natural body reaction as a protection us from danger.
GAD is when that stress reaction gets turned on and stays on chronically, rather than the usual stress reaction of see a bear, run away, get to safety, relax.
In today's world we face fewer bears, and more chronic stressors such as work, relationships, finances etc. leading to more chronic activation rather than the typical brief activation this system was designed for.",GAD
1286,"Short Summary / TLDR:
Yes. Early research is very promising regarding the ability of CBD oil to help relieve anxiety, stress, and help improve your general mood.
I will explain this in detail and show sources down below.
What is CBD Oil?
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a type of cannabinoid, a chemical found naturally in cannabis (marijuana and hemp) plants.
Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), another type of cannabinoid, CBD doesn’t cause any feelings of intoxication or the “high” you may associate with cannabis.
CBD is derived from hemp plants with little to no THC, so it’s legal nationwide and not psychoactive.
How CBD Works in Your Body
The human body has many different tiny receptors inside what’s called your ECS (Human Endocanabinoid System). Receptors are protein-based chemical structures that are attached to your cells. They receive signals from different stimuli.
CBD is thought to interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors. These receptors are mostly found in the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, respectively.
CBD interacts with the CB1 and CB2 receptors to positively affects your mood and perceived stress.
So now that you’ve seen an overview of how CBD works, let’s see how it can be beneficial.
CBD for Stess and Anxiety? The Research
As I mentioned above, several studies point to the potential benefits of CBD for anxiety.
For generalized anxiety
For generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) says that CBD has been shown to reduce stress in animals such as rats.
Study subjects were observed as having lower behavioral signs of anxiety. Their physiological symptoms of anxiety, such as increased heart rate, also improved.
More research needs to be done, specifically on humans and GAD.
For other forms of anxiety
CBD may also benefit people with other forms of anxiety, such as social anxiety disorder (SAD)and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It may help treat anxiety-induced insomnia as well.
In 2011, a study researched CBD’s effects on people with SAD. Participants were given an oral dose of 400 milligrams (mg) of CBD or a placebo. Those who received CBD experienced overall reduced anxiety levels.
Multiple recent studies have shown that CBD can help with PTSD symptoms, such as having nightmares and replaying negative memories. These studies have looked at CBD as both a standalone PTSD treatment as well as a supplement to traditional treatments like medication and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
For other neurological disorders
CBD has also been studied in other neurological disorders.
A 2017 literature review on CBD and psychiatric disorders concluded that there isn’t enough evidence to tout CBD as an effective treatment for depression.
The authors did find some evidence to suggest that CBD could help with anxiety disorders. However, these studies were uncontrolled. This means that the participants weren’t compared to a separate group (or “control”) that might have received a different treatment — or no treatment at all.
Based on their review, more human tests are needed to better understand how CBD works, what the ideal dosages should be, and if there are potential side effects or hazards.
How to Buy a Tursted, High-Quality CBD Oil
CBD is legal everywhere in the United States. But that also means that a lot of companies are selling a lot of different CBD products with varying quality.
I recommend to look for the following quality standards:
Organic
Lab Tested
Full Spectrum
Made in the USA
All Natural
Money Back Guarantee
After a lot of research and trying eight brands, I highly recommend the following two companies:
Jupiter CBD - the highest quality organic company for all-natural, full-spectrum CBD extract. 100% made in USA, extensive lab testing for strength and purity, and offers a 30-day trial with full refund guarantee.
Charlotte’s Web - high quality, older brand, unfortunately not organic and taste varies a bit. Overall a solid choice though.

1293,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD.

1294,"Of course. You have different levels of anxiety. It can stops you from doing things without having a panic attack.
Here is how I recommend you to cope with anxiety (worked for me):
Do sports (at home, if you feel more confortable) but 3x 30min/week.
Try to desensitize yourself (little by little) by exposing you to what situation makes you anxious.
Eat more greens, oilseeds, fresh fruits and food rich in magnesium such as: raw spinach, fish, beans, lentils, avocados, brown rice, bananas, figs and chocolate.
Do a cure of prebiotic and probiotic. Brain and gut are linked.
If you have a pet, cuddle with it more often and take care of it. It will make you shift your focus from anxiety to something else.
Try to catch the sun everyday for 10mins.
Check your levels of vit D and B12 (adjust with supplements if needed).
Learn how to breathe and cardiac coherence.
Yoga, you can find plenty of stuff online.
Mindfulness meditation, it’s not hard, stick to it.
When you feel anxiety, let it come, don’t fight against it. Take deep breath (inhale for 6 seconds, hold for 2, exhale for 6. Do it again). Just observe how tense and how bad you feel over nothing. Meditation can help to stand back.
Sleep enough (7 to 9hours/night).
Quit smoking and avoid drinking alcohol.
Smile. Smiling, even for nothing, tricks the mind and releases happy hormones.
Learn to manage your anxiety, it’s always going to be there because it’s a normal mechanism of protection but don’t let it rule you anymore. You are not alone, you are worth it.",GAD
1295,"I cannot confidently say that I have overcome panic attacks fully. I developed panic while I was on treatment for depression and anxiety way back in the late seventies. At that point the treatment for depression and for that matter any mental disorder was very limited . Only in the nineties it improved after the discovery of SSRIs and new benzodiazepines starting with alprazolam. SSRIs and benzodiazepines helped me to overcome depression and panic attacks for a long time . In 2017 ,the toll of taking these medications began to show up due to weight gain and water retention to mention two of the prominent side effects. I was forced to go off the medications cold turkey resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms. These included panic attacks which forced me to go to the emergency department of a hospital near my house 3 times. It took 4 years or so to get over the ill effects of stopping these medications. Thought I am feeling near normal with no signs of depression or severe anxiety, there are occasional panic attacks which I go through. I keep myself in good general health so as to get over occasional panics.Homeopathy and a balanced life help me to remain fit and cope .",GAD
1296,"Yes, in a nutshell, generalized anxiety is longer-lasting throughout and does not have as severe anxiety as someone with panic disorder throughout the day, when it is active. The person worries excessively about several things, that most people wouldn’t. This can result in body aches, not being able to sleep, and problems with concentration. Some people do have panic attacks along with generalized disorder but most do not. It can result in trouble at school or work, daily activities, and it feels miserable to have.
Panic attacks are part of anxiety disorder, just because someone has a panic attack does not mean they have panic disorder. A person with a panic attack can have one that seems to come out of nowhere or it can be a result of being exposed to something similar to which they had their last panic attack. A panic attack is supposed to last 15–20 minutes but varies per person. The person feels extreme fear and sometimes like they are going crazy or are doomed. They usually have four or more symptoms like shivering, rapid heartbeat, chest constriction, feeling like they can’t breathe, numb or tingling arms and fingers, etc. They also can have feelings of depersonalization or derealization. The feeling often feels like how one would feel if they were hiding under the bed and a murderer meant to do them harm is in the room looking for them.
Panic disorder happens because the attacks feel so terrible that people fear having them again. You did not ask for a description. On both of the disorders, medical causes and medications causing the problem have to be ruled out before a diagnosis is given.",GAD
1297,"I can answer this.
During my early twenties I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. One of the worst made me exit my car in the middle of the highway at night because I was thinking I was going to die; I felt pins and needles all over my body, felt that I couldn’t breathe and my heart was racing ao fast I though it was going to explode.
That is anxiety, that is what anxiety does.
Then you can’t stop thinking about it and when the next attack will be.
I went to a psychologist who then sent me to a pychiatrist.
He was very good. He listened to me, asked a lot of questions and so on. He also gave me Sertraline (an SSRI anti depressant) and Xanax, but told me not to take Xanax and just to do when I had an attack. I never had to take Xanax in the end.
I wasn’t depressed but the SSRI helps you get better at your anxiety. And it did.
After a month or so after starting I felt great. I was no longer worried about dying or grtting another attack. I could live life again.
I took them for almost 2 years. Now I’m almost 30 and been 3–4 years without them.
I sill struggle with anxiety at times but haven’t had and attack since.
Also I learned to read and listen to my body; I know when the anxiety is creeping in and I can stop it before getting an attack.
I’m married and have a great job and living life to the fullest.
Getting a psychiatrist and getting medication to help me was the best thing I did.
Just a note: there are different SSRI so talk to your doc if yours aren’t working or if you’re getting bad side effects, especially dangerous ones such as getting suicidal thoughts.",GAD
1298,"My GAD was so bad that I couldn’t eat, could barely sleep, was somewhat agoraphobic, and could barely concentrate on school. It’s hard to pick just one thing that may have been the “worst” thing.
Perhaps for me it was the “not being able to eat” aspect. I would experience hunger (occasionally) but the thought of eating made me nauseous. And the longer you go without eating, the more nauseous you get. My anxiety also causes nausea because of my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) so I was always afraid that anything I put into my body would end up coming back out, despite the fact that I rarely actually got sick.
I was chronically underweight for most of my life, had low energy and was nauseous all the time. It wasn’t until I sought out an eating disorder specialist a few years ago, and went on a particular medication for nausea and anxiety, that I was able to start eating more normally and regularly.
I also used to not be able to do sleepovers. Including vacations. I was afraid of getting sick anywhere but my bathroom. This resulted in some agoraphobia and to this day I still prefer to stay in my apartment than to go out.",GAD
1299,"Yes. Mine used to come seemingly out of nowhere. I’d be in traffic and all of the sudden here one comes. I’d be waiting in line at Walmart and one would come on and I’d have to leave. Elevators were a big NO. I’d be talking to someone and one would come on. Now that I’m properly medicated I can fight them. I still feel them coming on but they go away. I figured out my triggers were not being able to leave a situation. So I talk myself down BEFORE I get into one. Some catch me off guard, like seeing someone on the market who wants to talk but now I can handle that. So yes they can come out of nowhere but with therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) and/or meditation they are manageable.",GAD
1300,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long. Just annoyed and upset, and that’s perfectly fine!",GAD
1301,"The two main differences are: the intensity of physical symptoms and duration of attack.
A panic attack is a sudden episode of acute fear that occurs in the absence of real danger. A panic attack typically lasts a few minutes. When you have a panic attack you are terrified and out of control. You feel like you are dying. Your vision gets dark and narrow. Your heart is beating too fast. You have chest pains and feel chilled to the bone. You cannot breathe. Your entire body is going numb.
An anxiety attack is a general or specific feeling of worry that something bad is going to happen. An anxiety attack can generalize and the feelings of restlessness and stress can last for months. When you have an anxiety attack you feel stress. You feel overwhelmed. You have a huge knot in your stomach. You carry a heavy load on your shoulders. A dark cloud of negative thoughts follows your every move. Your muscles refuse to relax. Your whole body is tired and tense.",GAD
1302,"Anxiety is a part of human make up. It is a series of thought processes, reflexes and responses that affect our mind and body as we become prepared to avoid or deal with dangerous situations. We all experience anxiety (without panic) to varying degrees most of the time. For example, without anxiety (about being run over) we wouldn’t take care when we crossed the road.
Anxiety sits on a continuum with nervousness and panic:-
We can simply be nervous or it may increase into anxiety. Similarly, we can simply be anxious but if the fear of danger grows strong it may escalate into panic.
Take the following example of the man that is terrified of public speaking who has to make a speech at his friend’s wedding in a few weeks time…
› Weeks away, just thinking about the wedding will make him nervous.
Probably only slightly for the event is still some time away.
› Days away from the event he will probably be starting to get extremely anxious
just thinking about it. The nervousness grows into anxiety which gets stronger
and stronger as the day of the speech gets closer.
› The morning of the wedding he is now panic-stricken, terrified of making the
speech. So much so that he gets drunk enough to face it or makes excuses to get out of it and avoids doing it altogether.
This is how nervousness, anxiety and panic work alone and with each other.",GAD
1303,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
1304,"I have not actually!
Having experienced these for a decade now, you’d think I could say I’m the poster child for a cure- but after three therapists, multiple medications, and mental breakdowns/slumps, I can tell you I’m alive to tell the tale!
In my earliest years with the two , I felt such pain and discomfort with existing. Sometimes it can feel suffocating, and make relaxing nonexistent. It’s the level of pain and physical stress I wouldn’t wish upon anyone seeing it is difficult and sometimes trial and error to cure.
I’ve tried medications (I am currently on Prozac) and even antianxiety medications- which, didn’t do what I personally envisioned- but they do help some people so there’s no loss in hope!
My favorite coping methods to date have been:
being warm- my bed is a bonus- I feel safest there
Being in a bathroom- private ideally. In case I get too anxious to the point of vomiting, I can clean up and not stress about others worrying about me
Getting a tight hug
Closing my eyes
No noise or minimal noise (headphones help)
Squeezing a stress ball (I get fidgety)
Drinking water and going out for fresh air
Panic attacks are dizzying for me, so I tend to sit down or lay down if able. It would make me lose my breath and get stressed out, so I would try to minimize activity or demands on my body.
Anxiety isn’t easy, neither are panic attacks, but you learn to feel it coming- acknowledge it, and stop it in its tracks. It comes, but because I know what works for me, I won’t let it get severely awful and I make sure to remember my coping skills.
There’s a lot of things to try, even scents to smell when it erupts- but it’s a matter of personal trial and error. I live with the two everyday, and it’s not always present on the surface, but I know it’s dormant and I’m ready for it when it comes.",GAD
1305,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
1306,"Yes… Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) can co-occur with mood disorders and other anxious disorders, particularly panic disorder (PD). Some mental health disorders that commonly occur with generalized anxiety disorder include:

1307,"Yes. Many people suffer from anxiety without having full blown panic attacks with the symptoms of high heart rate, sweating, hyperventilation driven mainly by a surge of adrenaline from activation of the fight or flight branch of their central nervous system.
The previous answer gave a long list of things that you could do to help. Probably more than you want to tackle. I would focus at least on two of them to start with.
Try to face and analyze what is making you anxious. Getting to terms with your fears can alleviate that vicious circle. The triggers are usually nowhere as bad as you think.
Work on your breathing habits. There is plenty of clinical evidence that better control of your breathing helps a lot. This applies to many forms of anxiety and panic including asthma events, full blown panic attacks, PTSD, and even help in giving up smoking.
Slow regular breathing should be the target. We normally breathe at about 12–14 breaths a minute. In a full blown panic attack this can easily double. But at a much lower rate around 6 breaths a minute you can enter a state that is called coherence in which your heart and breathing work in their most efficient way. This is referred to as heart rate variability. I find this a great help for example if I can’t get to sleep because I am thinking about something that happened during the day. Getting down to my coherence rate puts me back to sleep immediately. Here are three videos that can explain a little more. One is just about heart rate variability, one covers panic attacks and one is actually a training video to help you get better relaxed breathing patterns.
They are from the breathesimple youtube channel which is full of educational content about breathing from a highly regarded breath trainer and researcher. Also you can learn more at the breathesimple web-site.",GAD
1308,"Oh lord, it is helpful.
I was prescribed them this summer and the first day I took them, I felt a little weird. I had been warned that it would take a minute to get used to them, but after the first day I avoided taking them again.
Then, I had my heart broken and it was damn near unbearable. I saw my bottle of pills and, knowing that they help with depression too, decided to start taking them.
That was two weeks ago, and I’m so glad I did it.
I don’t get chest pains nearly as often which is a welcome change.
I’ve seen a major decrease in the amount of time spent thinking that I’m going to die or thinking of all the ways I could die in any situation.
My specific medicine also helps with social anxiety which made a recent Christmas party much more bearable than it usually is.
And best of all: I can think about something stressful/upsetting without my brain spiraling down a rabbit hole of badness.
The only thing that upsets me is how long I waited to take them.
It’s really nice to start feeling like a normal person.",GAD
1309,"I have panic disorder. I think at its most literal definition, it's when panic attacks progress beyond normal and expected limits, they become a disorder.
More practically, for me, it means having one panic attack after another, for hours and hours until I'm so exhausted I basically pass out. The attacks themselves feature the usual heart racing (which doesn't bother me much, you can think your way out of this one a bit), feeling of impending death, saturating sweat, extreme thirst, freezing and hot back and forth, distorted vision, crippling leg cramps etc. They usually start when I'm sleeping, and sometimes when stressors are paradoxically low. I feel horrible the next day, with a sore throat, sore legs, fuzzy thinking, and a headache. Fortunately I saw a doctor and rarely have issues now. Anxiety is still there but panic marathons have mostly left the building.",GAD
1310,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are both anxiety disorders that involve excessive fear, worry, and distress. While they have some similarities, there are also some key differences in their symptoms and the situations that trigger them.
GAD is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about a wide range of everyday events and activities. Individuals with GAD may worry about things like work, relationships, finances, and health, and may find it difficult to control their worrying. Physical symptoms of GAD can include muscle tension, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping.
SAD, on the other hand, is characterized by intense fear or anxiety about social situations in which an individual may feel embarrassed, judged, or scrutinized by others. This can include situations like public speaking, meeting new people, or eating in front of others. Physical symptoms of SAD can include blushing, sweating, trembling, and rapid heartbeat.
While there is some overlap in the symptoms of GAD and SAD, individuals with SAD tend to have a more specific fear related to social situations, whereas those with GAD may worry about a broader range of issues. Additionally, individuals with SAD may experience more physical symptoms related to social anxiety, whereas those with GAD may experience more generalized physical symptoms like muscle tension and fatigue.
However, it is not uncommon for individuals with one type of anxiety disorder to also experience symptoms of another. For example, individuals with SAD may also experience worry and anxiety about non-social situations, and individuals with GAD may also experience fear and anxiety in social situations. In such cases, a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to the individual's specific symptoms and needs.",GAD
1311,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1312,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1313,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1314,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1315,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
1316,"Unfortunately, no.
General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.
I hope you get the difference.",GAD
1317,"This is very interesting question for me, as I have been a friend and only a friend, to someone who has suffered this for over 30 years.
If you care enough or love the person then you will learn to “handle” what they can throw at you.
It can and will be stressful at times, but I take a deep breath and have a break and clear my head.
It is a waste of time and energy to argue with them, but you cannot give in too much, just appease them and hope you are winning the mental war that is going on in their head. Find a happy medium.
Then I am ready for the next round.
It can strain any relationship of any kind, whether it is love or just friendship. But as long as people try to understand what the sufferer is going through and can be strong enough to cope, there will be moments when you want to give up, but then you realise there is no one else around to help them. So what do you do?
The main thing about any mental illness and people who live with someone with it, is the understanding what that person is going through, what it must be like to have this sort of illness, that cannot be controlled easily, as they reject medication through phobias and fear etc.
If you are in a relationship with one that had GAD or any mental illness you only have two choices - one is to walk away and not want to help them, or Two is to stay and help and get to know more about the illness and understand what is happening and how it affects them, but you must be strong minded and have very broad shoulders to take the insults, mood changes etc. etc.
In answer to you question, it is and can be a great strain on any relationship, but it is up the the person to decide if they stay and help or go and leave them to it. Simple as that.",GAD
1318,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD
1319,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
1320,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
1321,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident.

Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
1324,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) share some overlapping symptoms but have distinct clinical features.
Hallmarks of generalized anxiety disorder include:
- Excessive worry about everyday issues that is difficult to control.

GAD involves anxiety without a specific trigger, while MDD entails persistent sadness affecting one's whole life. Th...

1325,"Yes, even if they are episodic or infrequent. You need to learn to cultivate good thoughts, to make them part of your perceptual repertoire. Someone once said, there is nothing good or bad, but that thinking makes it so. In the course of the day, you will have thousands of thoughts, and you need to choose which perceptual filter to pass them through. Will your thoughts be ones that uplift or oppress you? You control the gateway, so examine your thoughts as they transition through your psyche to determine their intent before you indulge them and allow them free reign within you. Difficult? - - Yes, but with practice and determination, you can become a better gatekeeper, and attune yourself to the messages with which you flood yourself.

You tip-toe out of your house like a cat,hoping that the next door neighbour doesn't see you.
You only step out of the house after making sure that no one you know(acquaintances) is watching you. This is a golden rule of mine.

Your words stumble in your mouth as you end up mumbling in front of authority.
Telling your crush that you have feelings for him/her is a distant dream.Hell,you can't even amass the courage to say a simple “Hi”.

1328,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) can significantly impact relationships in several ways. People with GAD often experience excessive worry and fear about various aspects of life, including their relationships. This constant worry can lead to:
Communication Challenges: Individuals with GAD may have difficulty expressing their thoughts and emotions clearly due to their heightened anxiety. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration in relationships.
Emotional Distance: GAD can cause emotional exhaustion and constant stress, leading to emotional withdrawal from partners and loved ones. This emotional distance can strain relationships.
Overprotectiveness: Those with GAD may become overly concerned about the well-being of their loved ones, resulting in overprotective behavior that their partners might find stifling.
Conflict Avoidance: To prevent anxiety triggers, individuals with GAD might avoid conflict or confrontation, leading to unaddressed issues in the relationship.
Interference with Daily Life: The demands of managing GAD can limit one's ability to engage in social activities, attend gatherings, or fulfill relationship commitments, which can cause strain.
Dependency: Some individuals with GAD might become overly dependent on their partners for emotional support, which can create an imbalance in the relationship.
Loss of Intimacy: The constant worry and anxiety can lead to a decreased interest in or avoidance of intimacy, affecting the physical aspect of relationships.
Navigating a relationship with someone who has GAD requires patience, understanding, and open communication. Encouraging them to seek professional help and providing support can make a significant difference.

There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD

Major Depressive Disorder- You are depressed because you feel like a train wreck waiting to happen and feel out of control of your life and it sucks.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder- You feel like the world is a giant maze, and you are being chased by the rats, never get any cheese and feel like you never will. This is your emotional dysregulation. It’s the part of you that can’t cope or hasn’t learned to yet, but you will. It’s called coping skills and also there’s probably a medication for that.
With Panic Attack- taking the anxiety to the next level like being on a stair case with no railings and it’s curvy and going higher and there’s no way to exit? That’s what it feels like to experience a trigger without warning or knowledge of how to handle it. Coping skills!!!
Adult ADHD- the culprit behind the first three. You have probably lived with these things your whole life, now you have a real reason for it. It’s not the end of the world. It’s the beginning of your new life and adventure. You get to know your authentic self, not this traitorous hack that’s been mimic everyone else! Yes, we mask and we pretend. No more pretending, just learning, coping and using the skills learned. You will have excellent days where you finish stuff and days where you are just too tired to try. It’s okay, both days need to happen for you to learn balance, routine, learn to control your environment, set boundaries and learn time management skills.

1336,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

1338,"I wish I could say it was cured. I can say it is well-managed. My level of anxiety is 90% less than it was at one time. And that is a good thing.
The cause of generalized anxiety disorder is not fully known. It may be genetic, and the latest research indicates it could even be the result of inflammation in our nervous system. In my case, genetic seems most likely as it runs on one side of my family. And that being so, it explains why I’ve struggled with through my life.
My greatest gains in anxiety were learned, over time. Learning by me, and learning by my health care provider. Initially he relied on medications, then counseling. Yet there was true break through with one session in which he told me that I had to realize that my anxiety has nothing to do with my thoughts—that it was an emotion. Just a feeling. The thoughts only followed as a result. It was like a light went off in my brain—all of my efforts to think my way through anxiety were useless at the time it was occurring.
Over time I realized that if it was a feeling, and one that had nothing to do with reality, then I needed to see it as a medical symptom—just as I would dizziness, sweating, or feeling flush. And to stop “feeding” it with seeking cognitive answers, which were just as likely to increase it as decrease it.
It can’t kill you or me. Anxiety can feel like it will certainly be the end of you, but it is a false emotion—not used on real threat. It will pass. We have to learn to deny the thoughts that it produces.
I also learned that certain activities produced stress that fed into the physiologic roots of my anxiety. My work was very stressful. And when you are under constant stress, it raised your cortisol levels. Not good for us anxiety types. Eventually I decided to make a major change in my occupation specialty. Yes, that was stressful in itself, but, it really helped in the long run. Not everyone needs to do that, obviously. For me it was a no-brainer. I had realized it for at least 20 years, but just couldn’t make the move earlier.
Another major improvement came when I became sick and tired of being anxious. I realized that the anxiety was worse than any of the things I worried about. It’s exhausting. I can remember the day that I shouted out, “Fine! Let the world go up in flames. I don’t care, anymore!”
I don’t mean to present this as a smooth, step-by-step process. There were ups and downs. Things that didn’t work. Times I had to go through the humiliation of my realizing my limits. But I began to learn how to better detect when I was becoming anxious, and recognize my typical failed patterns to deal with it. Often it was learning to simply call it what it was and accept it in many situations.
Finally, I am convince that much of my help has been spiritual—coming to realize that there was a God and that he was not silent. That he was sovereign over the affairs of life. And that there was good intended in my suffering.
Anxiety can be managed, if not cured. My condition now is stable. I choose to remain on a small dose of antidepressant as it prevents relapses. No, it’s not ideal—I would prefer to be off of those entirely but I’m on a mere fraction of what I used to take. I know my anxiety disorder is there, of course, always hiding under the waves of life. But it’s no longer a monster—just a medical issue which can be managed.",GAD

1341,"The problem here lies in your question. How to CURE anxiety.
The word “cure” implies a battle with a condition and that by fighting it with a particular technique you may be able to beat it.
I have lived with chronic anxiety for decades and for a long time was approaching the problem in similar way. I tried all sorts of things to fight the condition, always thinking that there must be some new method that I hadn’t yet discovered to combat the problem.
Eventually I realised that the way to deal with anxiety is not to fight it (it seems that this can actually make it worse sometimes) but instead to completely and utterly accept it.
When you are feeling anxious and your body is doing all sorts of strange things in response (believe me, I have had every physical anxiety symptom you can think of over the years), then just completely and utterly submit to it. Think to yourself “I am anxious right now. My body feels very bad, but so what? I’ve been through this many times before and eventually this sensation will start to subside.”.
Through total submission and acceptance, the intensity of your anxiety attacks will slowly start to reduce. Don’t expect a quick improvement or any improvement at all for that matter. Instead just keep on accepting it. Eventually by not focusing on your anxiety so much, it will become less prominent and you will be able to live more of a normal enjoyable life.",GAD

1343,"You’ll need medication.
If you’re suffering from Panic Disorder be sure to talk to a psychiatrist near you. You won’t be able to handle it on your own, but you also need to understand that no pill will solve everything, and it certainly won’t be an easy (or quick) fix. Medication can help you in the long run by helping to tackle your panic attacks, but after that you’ll still need to deal with it psychologically. My experience was having around 10 panic attacks within 24 hours, not sleeping, not eating, living my life in a single chair, watching the same shows, playing the same games, and generally just hiding from everything. After I got my panic attacks under control, I needed to re-train my brain to get out of the cycle and the little world which I had made. Even now I’m still getting over it, challenging myself to do things, breaking habits that I formed through my experience, etc.
An important thing to do is to reach out to friends or family and talk about what you’re going through — they can help you. Without the support of my family, I would have fallen into pits so deep that I couldn’t have been able to get out.
On top of that, there are all kinds of other things you can do to help tackle anxiety. Obviously everyone is different, for me two of the most helpful things were deep-breathing techniques and herbal teas.
Try researching about the condition, you might find it’ll help you feel like you can understand things a little better.",GAD
1344,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
1345,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long.

Unfortunately for plenty human beings, attending to sleep and staying asleep isn’t as clean because it should be. Anxiety and insomnia are two very not unusual issues that can hamper your potential to go to sleep. Both conditions can purpose you to put wakeful for hours, thinking if you'll ever get even a wink of sleep before your day starts offevolved again.

Practice These Coping Skills Every Day
I endorse doing many — if not all — of the following coping talents and techniques as soon as a day when experiencing despair. It’s vital to recognize you probable received’t be inspired to do any of them at first due to the fact despair frequently saps motivation. In different words, know that it’s ordinary to sense unmotivated till you’re halfway finished.
The patients I work with who regularly practice those coping capabilities get higher. The seven strategies may be memorized with the acronym MY PEERS.
1. Meaning: Find small ways to be of service to others.
Find non-public which means through serving something larger than your self. Remember carrier doesn’t should be huge to remember. Consider this, “Success, like happiness, can not be pursued; it should occur… because the accidental aspect effect of 1’s non-public willpower to a course extra than oneself.” – Viktor E. Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning
2. Your dreams: Find plausible goals that give you a feel of feat.
Most human beings experience guilty whilst speakme about goals due to the fact they set unreasonable or unworkable desires. A aim is possible if it’s:
Something you can manage (i.E., it doesn’t depend upon others)
Manageable (i.E., no longer overwhelming)
Realistic for you (not for someone else)
Measurable (i.E., you recognize whether or not it's miles accomplished or getting carried out)
If some thing goes incorrect together with your purpose, undertake a “what can I research from this?” mind-set (versus a judgmental, “that is why I’m horrible” mind-set). Also, be careful when comparing your progress with others. We normally compare our largest weak point with another man or woman’s largest strength. This is unfair (and typically not correct in any case).
3. Pleasant Events: Schedule satisfactory sports or activities.
Don’t look forward to yourself to be “in the temper.” For instance, provide your self permission for a 30-minute “vacation” or agenda a healthful hobby every day. Just keep in mind to do those sports with the right mindset (see Engagement). Also, practice gratitude — take time to note what went nicely these days, not simply what went wrong. Consider keeping a gratitude magazine. Know that being grateful in your blessings doesn’t suggest you need to bargain your issues.
Four. Engagement: Stay inside the gift.
This exercise is occasionally referred to as mindfulness. As nice you can, all through sports try now not to be for your head with self-judgment. You might not have the ability to turn off the self-judgment, but you could notice it and convey your self lightly lower back to the prevailing. Research shows that people with higher self-compassion additionally have higher self esteem or self-self assurance.
For the ones who have difficulty with self-compassion or wholesome engagement, you may locate self-compassion sports on Kristin D. Neff’s website here. Mindfulness Based Stress reduction courses are also available for the duration of Utah.
Five. Exercise: And, devour proper too.
Doing slight exercise approximately five times a week (30 minutes a pop) can dramatically help your temper. Moderate exercising is a stage of pastime wherein it's miles tough to sing out of your diaphragm while doing it. Also pay attention to how the type of food or drink you’re eating influences your temper. You don’t ought to do fad diets, but all and sundry can be depressed if they regularly binge on carbs, junk meals, and electricity beverages. Remember the virtue of moderation.
6. Relationships: Focus on folks that raise you up.
Interact often with others that convey you up (no longer human beings that carry you down). While it’s OK to have some by myself time, find a balance and don’t isolate yourself or the despair will linger.
7. Sleep Regularly: Try to preserve a ordinary sleep time table.
Keep a stability with now not too little and now not an excessive amount of sleep. Staying up past due one night time and then napping in excessively tomorrow is a certain-hearth manner to feed depression. Also, don’t try and resolve problems past due at night when your mind is half of-asleep.
As you exercise these coping capabilities, know that you’re at the course to overcoming depression
In contrast, despair has a tendency to linger while sufferers make up a motive why they could’t do these items. No remember what remedy you’re taking, doing several of these activities every day — specifically while you don’t sense adore it — is critical to the remedy of melancholy. These nice coping abilities may take time and exercise, but if we don’t make an effort to be well now, the durations of “unwellness” may be pressured upon us later.",GAD
1347,"Hey,
Same problem here. I used to go to bed at 12 PM and fall asleep at around 2 AM. Just couldn’t get a handle on those worry-filled thoughts.
What I found extremely useful was the 4–7–8 breathing technique.
Here’s how you do it:
Breathe in through your nose while counting to 4.
Hold your breath while counting to 7.
Breathe out through your mouth while counting to 8.
Repeat
But aside from this exercise, I suggest you focus on sleep hygiene as well. In other words, make sure you:
Go to bed and wake up at the same hour each day
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and other psychoactive substances after lunch.
Avoid screen time two hours before you go to bed.

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1350,"Yes, they can be considered a form of insomnia. If you are experiencing panic attacks at night that jar you out of sleep, this is normally caused by a nightmare activating your fight or flight response. If your panic attacks happen while you are trying to fall asleep, this can also be considered a symptom of insomnia. Your brain is releasing adrenaline at the time of your attack, preparing your body to either run or fight. Panic attacks are caused by the senses being stimulated by triggers or trauma. There's really no definitive answer as to why this happens, but most studies have found a traumatic event memory will embed itself in the brain and certain stimuli can aggravate it. For instance, one of my reasons for panic attack is very loud banging noises - noises that resemble a gun being fired in a closed space. (I was present when a shoot out happened inside of a small house.) These noises trigger me badly and almost always cause a panic attack. But I'm lucky, I have a medication for my panic attacks and my insomnia.
Some people do not have the same luxury as me with medications at the ready. There are a few ways to get through a panic attack causing insomnia, whether or not it's before or after you fall asleep. Some people use products like Marijuana or CBD for a calming effect, some to promote sleep, some for both. If you are without outside help/aid, it is important to remember to breathe. You can use whatever subjects you want, but this js what I do. When you can, take a look around at your surroundings and find 3 things that make noise. Then, find 2 things that are your favorite color. Then, find 1 thing that makes you happy. This will force your mind to focus while it's bustling with adrenaline and realize that there is no danger. This will make it easier to come down from that fight or flight feeling. When you're able to, get up from where you are laying and drink some cold water to help ground you as well.
Effective ways of treating insomnia are going to be medications, but like I said this isn't always the case. It is actually quite easy to get a prescription for insomnia through your provider, as treating it usually doesn't involve scheduled substances. Most sleeping medications also provide anti-anxiety properties as well, AND even go as far as to ease nightmares. They are almost always covered by insurance as well. In rare cases of severity, controled substances like benzodiazepines may be prescribed - but a provider will try many options on non-narcotic medications before putting you on a benzo. If you do not have insurance, products like marijuana/THC/CBD/Delta - even though are not always regulated - have proven to help as well. If Marijuana is legal where you are, walk in to a dispensary and tell them you need a strain for panic attacks and insomnia. I guarantee they will point you in the right direction.
I hope this helps. Toodles!",GAD
1351,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

Unable to sleep for a long time is dangerous. It can cause accidents. Taking sleeping pills, on the other hand, is far more dangerous. Insomnia is a serious medical condition that should not be taken lightly. I never tried sleeping pills and had difficulty changing my eating habits. I was in desperate need of alternatives. I discovered this incredible guide that really helped in just two days.
It was like a fun tutorial to make me doze off in just 30 minutes. I found it really hard to do so before this. I was skeptical at first, but the first practice sent me to dreamland for 10 minutes. Day 2 of using the trick, I was a sleeping beauty for 20 minutes straight. After getting used to my routine, I found it easier to sleep and had better quality sleep. It seemed unbelievable at first, but the trick I discovered improved my ability to fall asleep faster. Sometimes I don't need to do it. I guess my insomnia is gone!",GAD
1353,"I have not actually!
Having experienced these for a decade now, you’d think I could say I’m the poster child for a cure- but after three therapists, multiple medications, and mental breakdowns/slumps, I can tell you I’m alive to tell the tale!
In my earliest years with the two , I felt such pain and discomfort with existing. Sometimes it can feel suffocating, and make relaxing nonexistent. It’s the level of pain and physical stress I wouldn’t wish upon anyone seeing it is difficult and sometimes trial and error to cure.
I’ve tried medications (I am currently on Prozac) and even antianxiety medications- which, didn’t do what I personally envisioned- but they do help some people so there’s no loss in hope!
My favorite coping methods to date have been:
being warm- my bed is a bonus- I feel safest there
Being in a bathroom- private ideally. In case I get too anxious to the point of vomiting, I can clean up and not stress about others worrying about me
Getting a tight hug
Closing my eyes
No noise or minimal noise (headphones help)
Squeezing a stress ball (I get fidgety)
Drinking water and going out for fresh air
Panic attacks are dizzying for me, so I tend to sit down or lay down if able. It would make me lose my breath and get stressed out, so I would try to minimize activity or demands on my body.
Anxiety isn’t easy, neither are panic attacks, but you learn to feel it coming- acknowledge it, and stop it in its tracks. It comes, but because I know what works for me, I won’t let it get severely awful and I make sure to remember my coping skills.
There’s a lot of things to try, even scents to smell when it erupts- but it’s a matter of personal trial and error. I live with the two everyday, and it’s not always present on the surface, but I know it’s dormant and I’m ready for it when it comes.",GAD

1355,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1356,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1357,"Social anxiety disorder let me simplify it by using an example….
You are alone, go to school daily seeing a lot of peers having a group of friends who just chill and enjoy each other. You feel like what is problem with me!? Why can't I make friends like them! They just ignore my talks, not even say me hi. Day goes boring and thoughts come in your negative side of your brain. Which leads to anxiety and depression. It was a story but in reality it is happening more and more. Our world is lacking the mental illness cure
Social anxiety disorder means you are left alone and not be social anymore, having no friends which I think bieng alone is better than a group of friends. You can explore your life freely enjoy yourself. Make good friend a single friend is enough who thinks about you and respect your character. You know nowadays good friends are like finding a needle in dump. Once you found a rare friend, next you will be successful
Mark my words- Don't worry you have no friend at all or just one as one friend can change your character and behaviour for lifetime. Depends upon you that which typo friend you made. Choice yours good or bad. If no then wait because nature has a good perspective",GAD
1358,"I thought I had SAD for a long time, but I didn't quite have the symptoms. I was clearly introverted, as I became nervous in large groups, or going out to bars / clubs. However, I never got sweaty palms or shaky or anything to that nature. It’s more than likely just GAD, unless you have those more severe symptoms in large groups in which you don't know anyone, for the most part. Simply becoming more self-confident in yourself and learning to stop caring so much what others think about you, can make a huge difference…",GAD
1359,"Actually, SAD refers to seasonal affective disorder, not social anxiety. It is a type of depression.
That said, there is no “all autistic people”. Folks on the spectrum differ from each other as much as us NTs. It is true that a lot of autistic people have social anxiety. Autism manifests itself in many as a social disability: eye contact, emotional regulation, reading body language, small talk, making friends, reading between the lines, and social media are very often problematic for those on the spectrum. This quite naturally produces social anxiety. In addition, many on the spectrum have at least some sensory problems: noise, bright lights, and food textures among the most common. So you can see how a wedding reception, with many people, loud music, a crowd of strangers can be absolute torture for an autistic person. It would be like being dropped into a battle zone where everyone is speaking a foreign language.
We are making progress though. We are better at diagnosing ASD, and beginning to develop better therapies. We are learning how to explicitly teach social skills, and developing methods for coping/avoiding sensory problems. In addition, society gradually becoming more tolerant.",GAD

A.a",GAD
1361,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are both anxiety disorders that involve excessive fear, worry, and distress. While they have some similarities, there are also some key differences in their symptoms and the situations that trigger them.
GAD is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about a wide range of everyday events and activities. Individuals with GAD may worry about things like work, relationships, finances, and health, and may find it difficult to control their worrying. Physical symptoms of GAD can include muscle tension, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping.
SAD, on the other hand, is characterized by intense fear or anxiety about social situations in which an individual may feel embarrassed, judged, or scrutinized by others. This can include situations like public speaking, meeting new people, or eating in front of others. Physical symptoms of SAD can include blushing, sweating, trembling, and rapid heartbeat.
While there is some overlap in the symptoms of GAD and SAD, individuals with SAD tend to have a more specific fear related to social situations, whereas those with GAD may worry about a broader range of issues. Additionally, individuals with SAD may experience more physical symptoms related to social anxiety, whereas those with GAD may experience more generalized physical symptoms like muscle tension and fatigue.
However, it is not uncommon for individuals with one type of anxiety disorder to also experience symptoms of another. For example, individuals with SAD may also experience worry and anxiety about non-social situations, and individuals with GAD may also experience fear and anxiety in social situations. In such cases, a healthcare professional can provide an accurate diagnosis and develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to the individual's specific symptoms and needs.",GAD

1364,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD

Nothing matters. Nothing is worth any effort. Life is hopeless. And much more.
None of the interventions--drugs, therapy--worked.
Meditation and yoga helped.
Over time I learned that I put myself in that state--really a depressed state. Over time I began to understand a bit of ""why"" I am as I am.
I learned to become more aware of the now--my present existence--and found that there is nothing in my present existence to justify or explain the way I feel.
If I leave the now and drift into my past and my projection into the future, ""it"" returns.

1366,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help.

1367,"If you do it's probably mild. It's difficult to tell just from a small paragraph online. I have GAD so I'll use my experiences as an example. I've been diagnosed with it by doctors and by a psychologist for an ADHD assessment where GAD was one of the conditions gleaned from the assessment which also looked at my general mental state.
I was in and out of the ER 3 times my freshman year of college for panic attacks because I had a bout of health anxiety. I don't necessarily qualify as a hypochondriac as I've only had isolated cases of health anxiety. Another instance was when I was 13 or 14 and I thought I had a brain tumor and I had to get an MRI done to convince myself otherwise. Just this past summer (after the craziness of freshman year) I had to wear a Holter monitor to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with my heart as I thought there was. I've had minor health problems in the past. I was born with asthma and when I was 14 I had to get an episodic type of tachycardia known as SVT corrected via a non-invasive surgical procedure. It's not just about my health though, although that is the most debilitating mentally. I worry about death and think about it more so than most people (this is a prominent thinking style in people with GAD) and I appreciate every day I'm alive because of this awareness that I'd rather not haunt my mind. I've struggled with genuine happiness since I was probably 11 or 12 and I've always been a worrier. Since I was a toddler. There's a picture of me clinging on to my dad's shirt over some water when I was about 2 or 3 years old. I've been aware of the imperfections and error-prone nature of people for a long time. Kids in elementary would piss me off every time they tried to justify something by confiding in their parents' fallaciously perceived omniscience. It's difficult when you question even the people you're supposed to trust the most. The world is so full of doubt and uncertainty.
Basically my anxiety is a product of my experiences and the fact that I have an over-active and curious mind. I'm always analyzing and questioning things and I love learning. My life is a perfect example that supports the trite saying ""Ignorance is bliss."" I simply think too much sometimes and my mind can become obsessive about certain things.
Another thing that contributes to my anxiety is the awareness that the world could be a better place and the realization of how small we are. It's quite humbling, but scary at the same time. I've been working on changing my perspective, using the basic ideas behind cognitive behavioral therapy. And I'm beginning to become happier, but it's a challenge. I have mild depression too which is probably what these realizations contribute more so to than anxiety, but they cause an internal distress.
I don't want to drag this out much longer. Basically GAD is something that is persistent across various things in one's life. Sure it does develop later in some cases, perhaps as a result of circumstance, but it's most often due to a chemical/physical nature of the brain. People with GAD are already predisposed to develop it. The symptoms typically cause some interference in your ability to function optimally in everyday life. If you think you have it you should see a psychologist to get a proper diagnosis.",GAD
1368,"I don't pretend to know all the answers but as always, I try to relate by writing from my own experience.
In my own experience, I know how you feel and I completely understand because I am a person who has not felt very many feelings or emotions for a very long time. I've buried all my feelings and emotions for a long time because they're too difficult to deal with. Whenever I find myself in an overwhelmingly stressful situation (emotionally, mentally, physically), I ""shut down"" that is, I stop feeling. I numb myself.
I can see a sad situation and not feel anything even though I'm supposed to feel sad. I think psychologists call this ""dissociation"". When you're overwhelmed, you dissociate. I did it because it was easier for me not to feel anything in that situation. It was my coping or defense mechanism. Any time something bad happens, my brain automatically cuts off all emotions.
I have found that this doesn't only happen to negative things but positive things as well. I went to GenCon2015 (it's the largest gaming convention in the world) and I was excited to go but if you looked at me or talked to me during the convention, you wouldn't see or even feel any kind of positive emotions coming from me. I had effectively shut those emotions down. Throughout the 4 days of the convention, I felt like a zombie with no feelings.
The only feeling I can feel is anger. I can feel extreme rage and anger - which is really not an emotion but rather more of a response. I was angry towards all the other participants of the convention because I was angry that they were all so happy and excited. I am often angry at myself for not being able to feel anything. I have expressed this to my psychologist who had explained to me that I feel angry because it's easier to feel angry than it is to face my real emotions. I feel angry so that I don't have to feel anything else.
In the same way, you may not feel anything because it's easier to not feel anything. You're protecting yourself from having to face whatever ugly truth that you're avoiding as I did. You could also feel nothing because it's painful to feel emotions like sadness. Again, it's your way of protecting yourself. My psychologist said to me, ""It's not that you don't feel... It's that you feel too much. So much that your mind cuts you off so you don't have to take in the pain of the world!"".
I hope this helps!",GAD
1369,"Being a victim of social anxiety disorder for several years, I think I am eligible to answer this question:

You only step out of the house after making sure that no one you know(acquaintances) is watching you. This is a golden rule of mine.

1371,"You are sad…because you want to be sad. You are allowing sadness.
We are human beings and all of us faces ups and downs throughout our lives.
But we can't sit idle and wait for sadness to sit beside us and entertain us. We need to get up ourselves and change our own mindset.
Accept as you are. Accept as they are. Accept as the world is. You cannot change others…you need to change yourself.
Get up and follow few suggestions of life to make your own self happy and always.
1. Get off from the bed every morning almost at the same time.. put alarm.
2. Do your bed, make breakfast. Clean your house and declutter immediately…every week. Clutter brings bad luck.
3. Make yourself up, wear clean dress and feel that you are the most unique person in the world. Accept yourself. Accept your pros and cons.
4. Keep salt in a glass bowl or bowls at the entrance door and windows.. to remove negativity from your house.
5. Do gardening, keep pets as they are natural healers.
6. Help people and keep smiling always. Smile attract smiles. People will also smile at you.
7. Exercise or do Yoga. Walk a mile every day. These will increase your good hormones.
8. Besides earning bread and butter, do some social works… when you will see that many people can't afford eating also, you will forget your sadness.
9. You can start reading books, listen to music and do things like cleaning etc yourself.

Okay let's start with a PRO LIFE TIP:
Whenever you feel like this “I am feeling sad but there is no particular reason why”
Just take a notebook and pen and start writing whatever comes to your mind! I repeat whatever.
While writing your brain will be sorting different things! And you will be knowing what is that exactly which is making you feel like this!
Let me assume some points which you will be writing:
I don't know why the hell I am sad from inside?
Is my relationship with people behind this!?
Is all this because of my academics?
Is all this because of my insecurity regarding my body?
I just assumed 4, your can be different and completely opposite also, but the point I want you to learn is when you write everything it's easy to circle the odd one out, and whether there will be 100 reasons or just 2, at the time when you wrote, just think about the one, just circle the one out of them which you are feeling the most, there can't be 2,3,4 or 100, there is always a ONE THING.
When you realised that, just work on that whether it is - your family relationships, your job whatever just focus on that! Make a blue print of solving that! And start working the hell out of it!
Sometimes it will not be the one thing which was really bothering you from inside but by working and achieving that one and only one thing, you will drive a sense of confidence and self appreciation!
It's never “I am feeling sad, but I don't know why”
There is always something, find that and kill that!
I think that my this answer can also help you alot:

1373,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1374,"It is possible that you have lots of things to feel sad and upset about.
People tend to think that “being positive” and “choosing to see the bright side” are as easy as choosing which shirt to wear. But this neglects the possibility that some people are having back-to-back tragedies worthy of sadness.
But I don’t know you or your situation well enough to know whether you do or do not have legitimate hardships.
And even if I did know you and your hardships, it wouldn’t matter how bad I thought they were.
I have had hardships and tragedies, and controversies that negatively affected me and the people I care about.
Some of them, are still in effect.
At some point, I have decided to humble myself to my issues. There are things I do not and will not ever have the power to undo or improve. I have the right to be sad my whole life. And even if people think I’m being dramatic, it won’t change how these things make me feel.
And I don’t want to live bothered by my past.
It takes a lot of work to choose to “move along” with life. I don’t mean “choosing optimism” because frankly I don’t feel optimistic about my life in all ways, all the time.
But on top of all the things that bother me from over the years and in my day to day, I still have things to do and only so much time in the day.
I’m clearly about to suggest taking a positive perspective, but I want to be clear; I don’t think it’s a solution to every problem or very easy.
I choose not to be sad (sometimes) because I frankly don’t want to. It’s not about having the time or a reason, but I want to be active, get things done, and it would be much easier if I could tell my emotions to “Chill!” for a second while I’m busy with other things.
Now I do give myself time, private time, to feel the feelings to proceess the emotions. Even the ones that really hurt. But I also don’t do so thoughtlessly. When I open up the flood gates and let the hurt out, I give myself a minute to boo-hoo, compose myself, and then think >what is the source of that feeling?< >why is this still affecting me?< >is there anything I could do to be free from this hurt?<
I went into detail about my coping strategies because of how your question is phrased.
Truthfully I have no clue why YOU are constantly burdened with things that make you sad and/or depressed, but that’s (again) because I don’t know your situation. And even in-person, I can’t feel your feelings for you and I can’t do the work to make the improvements. Only you can.
Thinking about how we want our life to be or become provides a target to compare to our current situation. Thinking about what we want to change, gives a starting point. From there we can only work on it and believe we will get closer.",GAD
1375,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
1376,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave.

1378,"This is a very individual response. Some patients do better on clonazepam others, Valium is working better. There is a lot of pressure on us to not prescribe medications with a “bad” rap, and so Valium (Valium almost 70!) is underutilized in this regard when a benzo is required in my experience. They’ve both got nearly 60 years of clinical research and are both very safe and effective when used as prescribed. They can, however, be addictive, and they lead to dependency in most people who take them longer than a 8 weeks, necessitating either a slow taper or switching to a long acting seizure preventative like gabapent...

1379,"Diazepam would be the clear obvious winner. It’s not only the “prototype drug“ of the benzodiazepine family, but it’s also made up of two other benzos, which most people don’t inform you about. When you take Valium it breaks down into three metabolites, nordiazepam, temazepam (restoril) and oxazepam (serax) which are both sedative/hypnotic benzodiazepines. Though both clonazepam and Valium have both longer have lives than most benzodiazepines, the time it takes for diazepam/Valium to kick in is substantially quicker than that of clonazepam, that’s if you get any effect from clonazepam at all nowadays. Clonazepam is probably the weakest benzodiazepine when it comes to usefulness, potency, and trustworthiness. I have had every manufacturer since accord reared its head up and started popping into all the pharmacies, and ever since activis, teva, and Qualitest pharmaceuticals were no longer the same formulation, they are also significantly weaker as well. Clonazepam now is pretty much a placebo medication is what I’ve gathered. That is the only reason I started taking alprazolam in the first place. If you can find, the old Sandollar is generic clonazepam, that is the only one that has what feels like at least the 80% limit of active benzodiazepine. Literally EVERY Single one is a placebo now. Stay away.",GAD
1380,"Hi Andie, thanks for the A2A. First thing you need to know is that I’m not a medical professional. Beyond that, I don’t have any recent experience with either drug. But what I can say is that you should talk to the prescribing doctor to start with. But I will say that it would be very important to remember that drugs effect different people in different ways.
The other thing that’s important to know is that all of the benzodiazepines, to my knowledge, are addictive. So you’ll want to be very mindful of that. These two drugs have different half lives, so your doctor will keep that in mind as s/he decides which to prescribe.
LASTLY, and this is very important to know, clonazepam has a side effect that can be difficult to deal with. If you take it to often, more than directed, it has a propensity to cause more anxiety, making you want to take more of it, which only makes it worse. You can very easily end up in a vicious cycle that can really be very difficult to break. This is a particularly easy trap to fall into if it’s prescribed as a prn (as needed). I would strongly encourage you to be very cautious with this medication. Valium I have no real experience with.
Additionally, it’s important to remember that almost any medication, over the counter or prescribed, will have side effects that you need to be wary of. It’s also important that you educate yourself on all medications that you’ve been prescribed. Make sure that you know if there are any other drugs that will have a negative reaction to something else your taking… or is there a food that you shouldn’t eat with a med your taking. Your doctor can’t remember everything that could be problematic for you. Make a list of questions to ask your doctor about if you believe there might be a problem. And if you believe that there is something emergent or very concerning to you about something that you’ve been prescribed, call your doctor’s office right away.",GAD
1381,"I have had panic attacks, anxiety, and have suffered terribly from PTSD. When I had my first panic attack, I thought I was going crazy. Was the worst feeling in the world. At one point I felt I couldn’t live with them anymore, but a friend of mine took me to a doctor. The doctor explained what was happening and put me on Xanax (1 mg four times a day). When I got home from the doctor, I was terrified to take the Xanax because I didn’t want to take anything that made me feel weird or different. Well, it saved my life! It worked and worked well. I started feeling normal again.
I took Xanax for many years, not knowing that this was a drug that should only be taken for a short time. Forward a couple years…I didn’t like putting this into my body. It was causing me memory lapses real bad. At the same time I found out that Xanax was to be used short term only. So, I started seeing a psychiatrist who regulated my Xanax, helping me to cut down on it and at the same time, he started me on Klonopin. After about a month, I was completely off of Xanax, which I never thought would happen. But Klonopin helped just as much.
I think anyone who suffers from anxiety or panic attacks should always get therapy of some kind to go with any medicine they are prescribed. I say this because through my psychologist and therapy, I learned what a panic attack was. The fight or flight (sympathetic nervous system) in our body tells us that we are in danger so the blood flow increases to the muscles making us able to run faster. Our eyes dilate helping us to see better, our breathing quickens, heart beats quicker etc. This causes us to panic, but since there isn’t a reason to panic, the attack is very scary. BUT, when this happens, and our brains realize there is no danger, the (parasympathetic system) in our body kicks in and slows our nervous system down and brings us back to normal. Thats why a panic attack doesn’t last very long, although the effects of it can sometimes cause alot of anxiety. Once I understood this along with behavioral therapy, I started doing better. I’ve weaned myself down to 1 mg of Klonopin a day, compared to the 3 mgs. I started with.
My therapist also had me face my fears that came up while I was having panic attacks. I didn’t want to be in any enclosed places, couldn’t stand in line at a grocery store, driving was hard, etc….this was probably the best thing that could have happened because I had learned to breath myself out of a panic attack once I recognized the beginning symptoms. I got on an elevator with a friend, rode it feeling really anxious, but I did it. This made me feel good about myself so I did it several other times until I could do it by myself! This was a huge feat for me and I was very proud. I started doing this with my fear of heights, standing in lines, driving and I started feeling normal again.
Since then, I overcame my biggest fear of all…(heights and being in small places)…I flew on a plane. Never did I think this could ever happen…and since I’ve done that, I’m doing alot more things. I can’t wait to zipline high above the trees going really fast! Thats next month.
So, thats my story…the Klonopin helped me wean off of Xanax and I’ve weaned myself (slowly always) down to 1 mg of Klonopin. It can be done. Anxiety can be conquered!!! You just have to believe and trust yourself and face the unknown of what scares you. PTSD is a whole other story that I’m not ready to talk about. Sorry this was so long. :)",GAD

1383,"Clonazepam and Valium belong to the benzodiazepine class and are both effective for anxiety.

1385,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD

1388,"You’ll need medication.
If you’re suffering from Panic Disorder be sure to talk to a psychiatrist near you. You won’t be able to handle it on your own, but you also need to understand that no pill will solve everything, and it certainly won’t be an easy (or quick) fix. Medication can help you in the long run by helping to tackle your panic attacks, but after that you’ll still need to deal with it psychologically. My experience was having around 10 panic attacks within 24 hours, not sleeping, not eating, living my life in a single chair, watching the same shows, playing the same games, and generally just hiding from everything. After I got my panic attacks under control, I needed to re-train my brain to get out of the cycle and the little world which I had made. Even now I’m still getting over it, challenging myself to do things, breaking habits that I formed through my experience, etc.
An important thing to do is to reach out to friends or family and talk about what you’re going through — they can help you. Without the support of my family, I would have fallen into pits so deep that I couldn’t have been able to get out.
On top of that, there are all kinds of other things you can do to help tackle anxiety. Obviously everyone is different, for me two of the most helpful things were deep-breathing techniques and herbal teas.
Try researching about the condition, you might find it’ll help you feel like you can understand things a little better.",GAD
1389,Neither. Both are good only for very short term use and are highly addictive. The ONLY effective long term treatment for any of the anxiety disorders is psychotherapy. There is NO medication both effective and safe for long term treatment.,GAD
1390,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
1391,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD

1397,"I loved xanax, not to get high, although at first I couldn't get away from that, and don't be embarrassed, that's the nature of it and why its so highly abused. But it did it's job and it did it quickly.
I hated kpins because they took too long to work and I was committed to a long term downer effect. I could control the Xanax much better and they have a mood elevating quality that the other benzodiazepines don't. They worked best for me.
I was prescribed 2mg/4x daily. Fun at first but I realized that's not what I used them for. So I broke them in quarters and took only what I needed. If a quarter wasn't enough to kill the panic and overpowering anxiety, I'd do another quarter after I knew the first wasn't enough.
It sounds like you're idea is the best for what makes you feel better. It's also apparent that your not looking for something to get you high but your searching for an answer that not many can give.
If I was in your shoes with the experience I have with all the benzodiazepines, I'd be using the kpins like you thought would be best, and keep the Xanax for those times when your lost in a panic or a PTSD attack.
Xanax was developed as a sleeping pill to begin with back in the 60’s. They work great for that. But they are also the most effective for an all out panic attack and work quickly to stop that crap. I've not dealt with PTSD, but I know those that do, and if they work best in that situation, save them for that also.
Since the kpins work best as a daily, or when needed nerve pill, then that's what you use. There's not the issue with the addiction factor as there is with xanax, and I can tell you, they are a bitch to get away from. 30 yrs took a good 4–6 months of weaning, but the last part was more psychosomatic then it was the addiction.
I now use Valium, which I never liked, but I'm using a lower dose and only in the evening rather than several times a day.
You might find the solution to the drugged or sleepy feeling of the Xanax by lowering the dose to .5, or half of your 1’s. I was always balls to the wall with everything, especially Valium and I'd start with 10 mg then end up doing 30+, which make my problems with them self explanatory.
That's why I quit the 2 mg dose of Xanax and broke them according to the smallest that I could, and that solved all the tolerance and buzzed factor that it offered. In 30 yrs of use, I decrease my dose rather than increasing it. I still had an addiction, but I was using them, they weren't using me.
So do like you felt with the kpins, lower the dose on the xanax to see how that works to stop the drugged, or high feeling, use the Xanax only if absolutely necessary, or if you might need them for sleep, just be careful or you will end up with problems you don't want.
You don't need a lecture, you need direction and you will probably find that you had the solution the whole time. Just lower the Xanax, it's a strong but effective drug when it's used with some common sense and a smaller dose.
The majority of people I knew were the ones who gave the drug a bad name, because they weren't looking for true therapeutic effect, they were looking for the high.",GAD

Sadness is just sadness.
Both are valid. Because feelings are a tautology. They are what they are because they are.
I’m sad because I’m sad.
Is enough.
When you’re depressed, you’re sad without end. You can’t remember a time you weren’t sad, and you can’t imagine a time you won’t be sad. In depression you lose even the hope of hope.
And that’s a tautology too.
Sometimes you can have depression mixed with anxiety. In Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Holly describes this as the mean reds.
Believe me. You don’t want the mean reds.
The mean reds is when you lack hope but also chastise yourself for it. It’s a biting, scratching demon that throws you in a hole and then cackles as you try to claw your way out, clumps of dirt falling on your head as your fingernails tear.
The mean reds is lack of hope while you feed on yourself.

1401,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1402,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD

1404,"Yes. Here’s how it works. Anxiety generally leads to avoidance. So if you’re scared of failing at your job, you’ll avoid your job. Avoidance leads to self guilt. So now you’re upset at yourself for failing to do your job. Self-guilt reinforces the anxiety. Because now the the thing you’re afraid of is scarier than it was before. Now, you’re afraid of your job and you hate yourself for it. This goes in a downwards cycle of anxiety and self-guilt until you end up both terrified and filled with self-loathing.",GAD

1406,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1407,"Hey, thank you for asking this question!
Anxiety is a state of anticipation/worry that makes you restless and uncomfortable. If you are experiencing anxiety, you will be always worried about things that are about to happen, or are going to happen in future. There are no actual threatening situations in front of you, but you expect them to happen soon. This worry cycle always keeps you on edge. When you’re extremely anxious, you tend to avoid the situation that makes you anxious. But, it can also be adaptive to a certain level.
For instance, if you have a big presentation coming up, feeling a little anxious is not uncommon at all. In fact, it may motivate you to be well-prepared. But if you are extremely anxious, you may end up avoiding the presentation. Anxiety is likely to be accompanied by physical aspects like, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, shivering, sweating and a feeling of adrenaline rush.
On the contrary, depression is characterised by low mood and low energy. It is a feeling of hopelessness, helplessness and worthlessness. If you are experiencing depression, you will be so drained and don’t wish to do any kind of activity. You tend to lose interest in all pleasurable aspects and even your daily work chores. The physical aspects that accompany depression are, loss of appetite, lack of sleep, tiredness, fatigue. Depression actually manifests as the exact opposite of the high tense state experienced in anxiety.
Although they are totally different, these conditions can co-occur and can influence each other. That is, anxiety might lead to depression and vice versa.
If you or some you know is experiencing the symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, please reach out to a mental health professional. Take care!",GAD
1408,"Depression isn't merely sadness; it is an absence of emotion. It is hopelessness, helplessness, the perennial feeling of being stuck with no way to exit, sometimes more pronounced, sometimes less.
It is intense, and though the symptoms vary in their intensity, it is not time limited. Your everyday life is perfused with it. You wake up wanting to go back to bed, or sometimes, wanting to not wake up again. Tiny tasks, things like brushing your teeth or cooking yourself breakfast, seem to require an inordinate amount of effort. In part, that is because you don't have the bare minimum motivation required to get things done. I am not referring to the kind of motivation that makes you bounce with energy, ready to take on the world, but the silent motivation whose existence you don't even perceive consciously, unless it is lacking.
You try to work despite it, but a paper that would take you half an hour to read suddenly takes you two. You are not able to think sharply or clearly. It's like trying to see and make sense of what is going on around you while being under water. You want to, you're trying to, but it is muddy, and you're not able to breathe. You're focusing solely on survival, and other concerns, as important as they may be, pale in comparison.

And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food.

Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)

1412,"Here’s my layperson’s opinion:
Sadness is usually a state of disappointment with your environment. But usually, sadness doesn’t impact your metabolic energy unless the sadness is in the wake of a tremendous disappointment. Moreover, sadness can generally be resolved in therapy.
Conversely, Clinical depression is the symptom of an actual disease that occurs in the brain. This disease causes the brain not to produce adequate neurotransmitters such as Serotonin, Dopamine, and a few others. When this dynamic occurs, you experience Clinical Depression. This form of depression (unlike sadness) will cause you to lose a lot of metabolic energy. Your motivation deteriorates. You feel inappropriate guilt. You lose interest in things that used to give you enjoyment. You may tend to self-isolate. You likely spend lots of time in bed. You wake up feeling very exhausted. You often can’t go to school or hold a job. No amount of therapy can accomplish much during a Clinical depression. Usually, medical intervention is necessary. Visit a psychiatrist to get a formal diagnosis (ask a friend to drive you to visits with your psychiatrist, as I feel that driving while severely depressed can be just about as serious as driving while intoxicated!). They may likely prescribe an antidepressant drug based on their observation of you. Although Clinical depression is a severe medical condition, it is also highly treatable. Shock treatment (ECT) is usually about 95+% successful. But remember, antidepressants, like ECT, can take some time to work. I hope this response helps you!",GAD
1413,"Anxiety disorder refers to a broad category of mental health disorders characterized by excessive and persistent feelings of fear, worry, and nervousness. It includes various specific disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, finances, and relationships. GAD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders and can also be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue.
Here are some key differences between anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder:
Scope of worry and anxiety: While anxiety disorder is a broad category that includes various specific disorders, GAD specifically refers to excessive worry and anxiety about multiple aspects of life.
2. Duration of symptoms: In order to be diagnosed with GAD, the individual must have experienced excessive worry and anxiety for at least six months.
3. Specific triggers: People with anxiety disorder may experience anxiety in response to specific triggers, such as social situations or specific objects or situations, while those with GAD may experience worry and anxiety without any specific trigger.
4. Physical symptoms: While both anxiety disorder and GAD can be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and restlessness, GAD is more likely to also include physical symptoms like fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
5. Impact on daily life: GAD can significantly impact an individual’s daily life, making it difficult to function and complete daily tasks, while anxiety disorder may have a more specific impact depending on the specific disorder.
6. Treatment: Both anxiety disorder and GAD can be treated with therapy and medication, but the specific treatment approach may differ depending on the individual’s symptoms and needs.

1415,"What is the difference between generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and INFP personality type? I am diagnosed with depression and GAD a month ago.
If you have depression and GAD, they can occur together. Usally depression makes people not able to enjoy life like they used to or they feel very sad. Their appetite, motivation, and sleep may be disrupted.
Generalized anxiety disorder makes a person feel anxious and worried much of the time. They may know their worry is too much, but they can’t make themself stop worrying. They may worry about things that other people do not understand why they are worried about it. Sometimes they can not relax, have muscle tension and soreness, may not be able to concentrate (like depression can do too), or sleep well (like depression too).
Both can interfere with a person's daily life and make a person feel miserable.
The Briggs-Myer is not really an accurate test so you don’t have to worry about INFP, (sorry, many people really put vaule into it).
There is a 5-Factor personality test that is more reliable. People who are neurotic may be more prone to have negative feelings. While people with more extraversion (5-factor), may be more positive”.
From a paper on mental health and personality:
“People who score high on the Neuroticism trait tend to experience negative emotions, respond poorly to stress, and may struggle with impulsivity and psychological distress48–53. On the other hand, those who score high on Extraversion tend to enjoy social interactions, feel positive emotions more easily, and have better mental health and benefit from being sociable 54–67.”
Personality traits and dimensions of mental health
Abstract Individuals are different in a relatively constant pattern of thoughts, feeling, and behaviors, which are called personality traits. Mental health is a condition of well-being in which people may reach their full potential and deal effectively with stress, work efficiently, and contribute to their communities. Indeed, the link between personality and mental health as indicated by the 12-item version of the general health questionnaires (GHQ-12) has been well-established according to evidence found by decades of research. However, the GHQ-12 comprises many questions asking about different dimensions of mental health. It is unclear how personality traits relate to these dimensions of mental health. In this paper, we try to address this question. We analyzed data from 12,007 participants from the British Household Panel Study (BHPS) using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and generalized linear models. We replicated the factor structure of GHQ-12 labeled as GHQ-12A (social dysfunction & anhedonia; 6 items), GHQ-12B (depression & anxiety; 4 items), and GHQ-12C (loss of confidence; 2 items). Moreover, Neuroticism was positively related to all dimensions of mental health issues, Extraversion was negatively related to GHQ-12A (social dysfunction & anhedonia) and GHQ-12B (depression & anxiety), Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were negatively related to GHQ-12A (social dysfunction & anhedonia) and GHQ-12C (loss of confidence), and Openness was negatively related to GHQ-12B (depression & anxiety). These results contribute to theories including the predisposition/vulnerability model, complication/scar model, pathoplasty/exacerbation model, and the spectrum model, which propose that personality traits are linked to mental health and explained possible reasons. Psychologists may use results from this study to identify individuals who may be at high risk of developing various non-psychiatric mental health issues and intervene to avoid negative outcomes. Subject terms: Psychology, Human behaviour Introduction Individuals distinct in a relatively constant pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and these differences can be captured by personality traits. Personality traits have been categorized as ""essential psychological constructs"" are because they have a significant impact on important life aspects of health-related behaviors e.g., 1 , 2 , and the likelihood of psychopathology e.g., 3 , 4 , crime e.g., 5 , work experiences e.g., 6 , 7 , academic achievement e.g., 8 , romantic relationships e.g., 9 , 10 and parent–child interaction 11 . Nevertheless, it is unusual for social scientists to find a single domain of interests in which no evidence supporting the importance of personality traits has been presented. Personality psychologists generally believe that there are five major dimensions that can be used to categorize a wide range of possible personality traits. These dimensions are referred to as the Big Five, and they include Extravers

Hello
Normal sadness is the low or blue mood that comes to a person after he looses something. For example after the death of his parent or failing in exam, or getting robbed on the street etc.
In clinical depression sadness is only one of the symptoms. This sadness is due to no specific reason and should be minimum 2 weeks long. At the same time the person feels hopeless and gloomy. His sleep and motivation is negatively affected.
Sadness is just one of our emotions and after some days it vanishes on its own. Clinical depression is a mental health illness and requires professional help to overcome. A consultation of a psychiatrist or a therapist is usually required to come out of it.
All the best.",GAD
1419,"Clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are both mental health conditions that can significantly impact an individual’s daily life. Clinical depression is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. GAD involves excessive worry about various aspects of life, often leading to physical symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Understanding these conditions is crucial for developing effective coping mechanisms.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
One of the most effective treatments for both clinical depression and GAD is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to emotional distress. Through structured sessions with a trained therapist, individuals learn to challenge irrational beliefs, develop healthier thinking patterns, and implement practical strategies to manage their symptoms. Research has shown that CBT can lead to significant improvements in mood and anxiety levels.
Mindfulness and Meditation
Mindfulness practices, including meditation, can be beneficial for managing symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Mindfulness involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment. Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, guided imagery, or body scans help individuals become more aware of their thoughts and feelings while promoting relaxation. Regular mindfulness practice has been associated with reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression by fostering a greater sense of control over one’s thoughts.
Physical Activity
Engaging in regular physical activity is another effective coping mechanism. Exercise has been shown to release endorphins—chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers—and improve mood. Activities such as walking, jogging, yoga, or dancing can help reduce feelings of anxiety and depression by providing a distraction from negative thoughts while also improving overall physical health.
Social Support
Building a strong support network is essential for individuals dealing with clinical depression and GAD. Connecting with friends, family members, or support groups allows individuals to share their experiences and feelings in a safe environment. Social support can alleviate feelings of isolation and provide encouragement during difficult times. It’s important for individuals to reach out when they need help rather than trying to cope alone.
Medication
In some cases, medication may be necessary to manage symptoms effectively. Antidepressants (such as SSRIs) or anti-anxiety medications can be prescribed by healthcare professionals based on individual needs. While medication can be helpful in alleviating symptoms, it is typically most effective when combined with therapy or other coping strategies.
Establishing Routine
Creating a daily routine can provide structure and predictability in life, which may help reduce anxiety levels. Establishing regular sleep patterns, meal times, work schedules, and leisure activities helps create stability amidst emotional turmoil. A consistent routine can also promote better sleep hygiene—an essential factor in managing both depression and anxiety.
Healthy Lifestyle Choices
Maintaining a balanced diet rich in nutrients supports overall mental health. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids (like fish), whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and hydration are vital for brain function. Avoiding excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption is also recommended since these substances can exacerbate anxiety symptoms.
Limiting Stressors
Identifying triggers that exacerbate anxiety or depressive symptoms is crucial for effective management. Individuals should assess their environments—both personal and professional—and make adjustments where possible to limit exposure to stressors. This might include setting boundaries at work or reducing commitments that lead to overwhelm.
Self-Compassion Practices
Practicing self-compassion involves treating oneself with kindness during moments of suffering or failure rather than harsh self-criticism. This approach encourages individuals to acknowledge their struggles without judgment while fostering resilience against negative emotions associated with depression or anxiety.
In conclusion, managing clinical depression alongside generalized anxiety disorder requires a multifaceted approach involving therapy (like CBT), mindfulness practices, physical activity, social support systems, potential medication use under professional guidance, establishing routines, making healthy lifestyle choices while limiting stressors—all complemented by self-compassion practices.",GAD
1420,"Sadness is something that most people experience from time to time. Depression usually lasts for months or years. When a person is clinically depressed, it can interfere with their life in a significant way. A person who is depressed may find it hard to work, do household chores or keep up with a social life. Depression can make someone feel so fatigued that they are unable to do much of anything. Sadness can cause these feelings but usually for a short, temporary time while a person is experiencing an upsetting life circumstance. After the normal life circumstance passes or resolves, then the person is able to get back to living their life normally. Clinical depression and anxiety disorders are serious illnesses that affect a person’s life in a really negative way.

They are the only medication that seemed to help my anxiety & panic attacks. The doctor would usually throw in some kind of anti-depressant or ""sleep"" medicine like Trazadone.
About a year & a half ago I'd say, my doctor tapered me off the benzodiazepines (I was on Suboxone as well), it was at the time. I was so dependent on that pill that it ran my life.

I knew my tolerance was building up and I was getting concerned but it was helping at the moment. However, I never knew how addictive it was & how horrible the withdrawals where/are.
While I was on the Benzos my doctor at the time (still my doctor) told me to take the Klonopin/Xanax daily. So it went from only taking them for extreme circumstances to needed them daily. They worked very well but my tolerance built up quickly to where I was taking 4mg of Xanax 3 times a day. Eventually my doctor took me off due to me being on Suboxone as well. I guess doctors figured out mixing Bupe and Benzos was dangerous. Anyways, I just recently saw my PCP for my anxiety issues as my current psychiatrist isn't really doing much to help me. He just throws me on a bunch of meds to make a me a zombie, that his answer to my problems. Anyways, my PCP gave me a script of Xanax. Remember I was off them for a long time, they helped my anxiety right away as soon I took one.
I'm wondering if anyone here has also been a long time Benzo user? Are you still on them or have you found something else that works? I wish I could find a medicine that is quick acting like a benzodiazepine but without the terrible side effects (deadly withdrawals). Benzodiazepines are so addictive & with my tolerance I'd don't see how I can take them daily before I'm taking 10mg a day again due to the whole tolerance issue? I need something that doesn't take months to kick in. These doctors want to give me Paxil, Zoloft. I'm all for that, but what can I take in the mean time while I'm waiting 5 months for these depressants to kick in. There has to be a better way to live. I need a magic pill like Xanax but last all day.",GAD
1422,"I’ll share an experience I had with a patient 3 years ago.
She was 25, lawyer, homosexual but married to a man of her parents’ choice a year before. And she was persistently anxious, restless, apprehensive, jittery, low on confidence, distracted, unable to focus on work, repeatedly arguing with her husband, and resultantly feeling sad, disinterested, and frustrated with everything. The Family physician was not aware of the entire history and had diagnosed her with anxiety based on her symptoms and put her on benzodiazepines. She used them for four months continuously because they helped her feel better and her anxiety was at bay. But the moment she stopped the meds, the anxiety was back.
When she approached me, she was very clear that she was not going to be taking benzodiazepines. As a psychiatrist practicing cognitive techniques with a humanistic approach, we first got to the root of her anxiety. There were also other specific phobias like fear of close spaces and social apprehensiveness. Personally in my opinion, benzodiazepines offer symptomatic relief. In practice I prescribe them only in SOS situations when the anxiety and panic has hit, and the situation has become catastrophic. The appropriate management of anxiety lies in preventing it. And so we devised a cognitive behavior therapy protocol.
I did recommend a short course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for a period of six weeks while also simultaneously working with cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness techniques. The approach was somewhat like this.
Building a good rapport and getting the clients trust
In-depth analysis and a detailed history of symptoms
Understanding social and environmental implications
Identifying cognitive distortions and irrational expectations
Teaching mindfulness and self-awareness techniques
Tracking of moods to lookout for anxiety/ panic triggers
Identifying thoughts that contribute to negative emotions
Identifying crisis triggers and teaching crisis management
Building a assertiveness and self expression techniques
Roping in her family and husband for psycho education
Relaxation and systematic desensitization techniques
All this under cover of short dose of SSRI medication
Benzodiazepines offered as SOS medication for panic
Regular and timely follow-up’s and therapy sessions
She improved over the couple of months, SSRI medication was tapered off and she followed up for maintenance therapy at less frequent intervals. Until one fine day, she said “Doc, I’m fine”. I asked her when last did she feel like this. I reminded her that she had felt fine with the benzodiazepines even the last time around just a few months ago.
To which she replied:
“The last time around, my symptoms were controlled because of the medication. This time my anxiety has been dealt with from the root. The manner in which I approach things, the way I challenge my irrational thoughts and expectations, the assertiveness with which I communicate, the deep breathing and relaxation techniques that I use to calm myself, and the new life that I have now been able to create and live, itself inspires me to believe that I am absolutely empowered and then I can deal with most challenges that come my way. Hence I feel that I am healed.”
Since before that and more so now, I believe that cognitive techniques like thought restructuring, thought review, root cause analysis, rational emotive behavior therapy, self-monitoring, mood tracking, mood regulation, contingency management, systematic desensitization, deep breathing and relaxation and introspection are all targeted at the cortical level and the top down approach in anxiety management. The use of medication like benzodiazepines is a subcortical approach or the bottoms up method wherein the root cause of the problem is never solved. But these take more time, energy, commitment and patience on part of the treating professional and patient.
While the approach is always going to be different for different individuals, in general I am a believer of cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness techniques for coping with anxiety. And I personally advise benzodiazepines at the minimum.",GAD
1423,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1424,"For many of my patients with chronic anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, the first line treatments tend to be either the SSRI or SNRI antidepressant medications.",GAD
1425,"I think benzodiazepines generally make matters worse in anxiety. They “treat” in that they temporarily mask symptoms. The problem is that you pay interest on the symptoms being masked. There’s a process called neuradaptation which pushes back against the benzodiazepines. This results in increased sensitivity and greater urge to take more benzodiazepines. It often (not always) results in a vicious cycle of escalating anxiety and sedative use. Some people reach a equilibrium, but are stuck taking them for life and many need to escalate dose as their anxiety escalates.
I go into more detail here: How can you tell if Xanax is working?
So a better alternative is exposure therapy. SSRIs like fluvoxamine can help reduce sensitivity which makes exposure therapy less daunting.
Generally, Exposure Therapy is the most helpful treatment (eg online at THIS WAY UP or with a psychologist who knows how to do it). [I have previously worked with thiswayup, but I have no financial or other ongoing interests. ]
SSRI medication alone can be helpful, but Exposure Therapy tends to deal with anxiety more effectively and often permanently. Anxiety may come back if only meds are used, when the meds are stopped. Commonly both are used together. See also: What are some techniques (other than medication) that can help ease someone's anxiety or stress?
Lifestyle can play a critical role in reducing sensitivity/improving resilience: What are some methods to deal with anxiety? It is too frequently overlooked.
Benzodiazepines can help some in some situations. For an acute issue, like a flight phobic person who needs to get a flight, brief use makes some sense. But for chronic stress issues and for anxiety they make less sense and you might be stuck with them for life or they might make life miserable. Many people end up stuck on them for life and say things like “they work for me, I need them, I can’t get by without them” but the question is had they not started them would they still “need” them or could they have otherwise found a way to deal with the anxiety. Anxiety exacerbations are common and without Benzos the exacerbation are often be temporary.
(This video unpacks some of the problems with chronic benzo use. It does not promote any products or services, educational material only)
So better alternatives to benzodiazepines are skilled Exposure Therapy (the best solution), SSRIs like fluvoxamine can help. Often neglected is anxiety modulation skills and lifestyle modification, these help anxiety a lot and will fundamentally improve your life too.

1430,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
1431,"If it’s the only thing that works for you to live a normal, functional life and the pros outweigh the cons, then in my personal opinion and experience the answer is no. I’ll tell you a little of my personal history and why I am proof that benzodiazepines could help you lifelong.
first I’ll tell you I’m on both Alprazolam/Xanax 2mg 3 times daily and Adderall 15mg 2–3 times daily as needed. Have been for 16 years now.
I have been told that with my current psychological health issues that’s progressed over the course of a decade as well as the medications I’ve been taking to curb these symptoms since 2006, that if I were ever to stop my current mental health medication Alprazolam 2mg 3 times daily, even a slow, gradual taper, that without it I would have to be committed to one for the rest of my life. I’m diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, PTSD, chronic stage insomnia, ADHD combined type, psychiatric disorder unknown type, anxiety/PTSD induced psychogenic seizure disorder, (or PNES) for short, and am currently managing it with only two medications. Adderall ir 15mg 2–3 times daily or as needed for my ADHD, and Alprazolam/Xanax 2mg 3 times daily for my anxiety, PTSD, and psychogenic seizures.
the reasoning for me is that due to my vast trial and error of the majority of failed mental health medications, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, sedative-hypnotics, SSRI, and SNRI medications, I was put on benzodiazepines as a last resort for helping what was going on with me. It ended up saving my life, however years later I’ve witnessed some of the most sinister, disgusting and horrific things anyone could ever experience, plus I have been a victim of something I’d rather not mention nor ever think of again, but long story short, those terrible, horrible things I’ve seen with my own eyes combined with the near death experience and torture I’d encountered brought permanent changes and unforgettable, reoccurring thoughts and psychological issues into my life. My insomnia was turned into nonexistent sleep, scared of what I’d dream about when asleep, and when I did fall asleep I’d have the same reoccurring night terrors but they weren’t fabricated or something that’ll never happen, they were an exact reoccurrence of the traumatic experiences I’ve experienced, encountered and endured a few years back… (I don’t know anything but what my wife and family had told me about it) but I’d awaken, thrash around screaming incoherent sentences and pleas for help while kicking, punching and squealing) it had subsided after being taken to the ER via ambulance and given a sedative. I was then diagnosed with “psychogenic seizure disorder” where you witness or are the victim of something so severe and horrific that you go into a complete catatonic state, to where you’re not in your own time and place, you’re literate mentally transmitted back to that exact moment, place and time to where you think it’s actually happening again..
I’ve had a few since then and anything can trigger it such as a screech, a certain type of laughter, night terrors and noises, and it has gotten to where now even heightened anxiety can cause it. I have warning signs now which are numbness in my right arm and partial or complete vision loss. It means I’m minutes or sometimes hours from having one. I’ve had a few more since and every time I’ve done something different. Sometimes I’ll just stare with my eyes wide as golfballs and murmur things, I’ll start ranting and convulsing terribly laughing or crying, etc. for reasons I had to change pcp providers and my meds were cut in half. As soon as that happened I’d had 13 catatonic stupors, and 4 actual seizures.
finally I sought counseling and got put on a stable dose of medication.
but because of my mental health off my medication and the type of medication I take, the dose and the amount of time I’ve been on it, my original psychiatrist told me that if I were to ever get off, even what they call a “safe, long taper” and my already deteriorated mental state, I’d no longer be able to function in normal society without constant care and needs. I would have to be admitted into a psychiatric institution or have someone care for me, and that’s why I refuse to get off my medication. Am I dependent on it? Absolutely, but for good reasons obviously stated. As long as you don’t abuse it, and the benefits outweigh the risks, I say fight to maintain your health and safety. I hope this helped you!",GAD

Beta-blockers can be effective for situational anxiety. However, individual responses vary, and consultation with a psychiatrist is essential to determine the most suitable medication.

1434,"A doctor might write you a prescription for pretty much any psychiatric drug if you say you are having trouble with anxiety.
Not all doctors prescribe all drugs, and different doctors have different preferences and protocols, but all psychiatric drugs are prescribed for anxiety at some point, whether on-label or off-label. No drugs are particularly successful at helping people with chronic anxiety on average, but individual patients may respond very well just like they may respond very poorly or not at all.
Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics are three classes commonly prescribed for anxiety. Some drugs are FDA approved, many are not, but approval does not really mean anything for how effective or harmful you may find them. Anticonvulsants, hypnotics, beta blockers, dissociatives, blood pressure medications, antihistamines, cannabinoids, and even psychedelics have been prescribed for anxiety, as well. Anything goes, in psychiatry.
However, addressing the causal factors contributing to your anxiety is usually more productive than rummaging through the massive pile of potential drugs desperately hoping something will be worthwhile or at least not kill you or leave you disabled for months or years. Drugs are for when all safer, more tactical, and more potentially effective methods of recovery have failed or provided insufficient benefit by themselves or collectively.
If it gets to the point of having no other options than to dose yourself with neurotoxins, more goes into drug choices than what experience is concerning you (eg anxiety, depression, extreme desire to moon strangers). Everything from your past history and liver enzymes to the specific aspects of your anxiety that trouble you to your gender and weight can play a role in considering drug options, and this isn’t strictly a class-based parsing of chemical candidates.

1437,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1438,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD

I've had extreme anxiety & bad depression since the age of 14. Racing thoughts, always worried, a social anxiety in sorts, it does effect my daily life. Doctors have always put me on some kind of benzodiazepine; Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, you name it. You Contact my plug at Tharmedplug at protonmail dot com for all kinds of pills and buds. They are the only medication that seemed to help my anxiety & panic attacks. The doctor would usually throw in some kind of anti-depressant or ""sleep"" medicine like Trazadone.
About a year & a half ago I'd say, my doctor tapered me off the benzodiazepines (I was on Suboxone as well), it was at the time. I was so dependent on that pill that it ran my life. Everywhere I went I had to have the bottle with me, so worried about having a panic attack or my anxiety popping up out of the blue, I couldn't go out with out it. I knew my tolerance was building up and I was getting concerned but it was helping at the moment. However, I never knew how addictive it was & how horrible the withdrawals where/are.
While I was on the Benzos my doctor at the time (still my doctor) told me to take the Klonopin/Xanax daily. So it went from only taking them for extreme circumstances to needed them daily. They worked very well but my tolerance built up quickly to where I was taking 4mg of Xanax 3 times a day. Eventually my doctor took me off due to me being on Suboxone as well. I guess doctors figured out mixing Bupe and Benzos was dangerous. Anyways, I just recently saw my PCP for my anxiety issues as my current psychiatrist isn't really doing much to help me. He just throws me on a bunch of meds to make a me a zombie, that his answer to my problems. Anyways, my PCP gave me a script of Xanax.

1442,"I had a doctor once describe them as “alcohol in a pill.” That's not a terrible analogy. They not only dull all your senses, but they can put an effective halt to feeling any emotion. In short benzo’s numb.
Also they don't actually stop anxiety, just temporarily suspend it. They won't resolve the issues that cause your anxiety, and they won't help you find coping methods for when it returns. And it always returns, especially so when you're treating it with benzodiazepines. If your anxiety is such that it's seriously impeding your life daily, and also prevent you from working on other behavioral issues, then they may be an effective short-term treatment.
If you are prescribed regular-dosing of benzos for anxiety, they can't be stopped just because you don't want to take them anymore. They must be tapered gradually (only under doctor supervision), because if you stop suddenly after taking them regularly - you can start having seizures. So in addition to being psychologically addictive they also cause physical dependency.
And I can promise (as an epileptic) that if you start having seizures your anxiety will only grow. If you can imagine randomly, no matter where you are or what you're doing, suddenly dropping to the ground and convulsing. It carries a generous heaping of anxiety all on its alone, in addition to whatever other anxiety you have. Plus I've hurt myself in all manner of unique ways during seizures - including biting off a large chunk of my tongue, putting my elbow through my fiberglass bathtub, and many more (seizure-induced injury is a topic in itself). Then benzodiazepines can become this positive-feedback loop, where if you don't take them then you can be fairly confident that you will have anxiety. This is true whether you start having seizures or not.
If you want to find a solution to your anxiety then it takes plenty of work. It's not an easy, half- ass type of approach. Taking benzodiazepines is effective in the short-term, but it's like when you take unnecessary antibiotics anytime you catch a sniffle - your anxiety will adapt to it and then benzos won't work at controlling it.
Try to figure out where your anxiety is coming from. Dealing with that is the only way to put an end to it. Plus learning how to manage it without pills will put a powerful, confidently-operating tool into your pocket that you can use to minimize problems from anxiety. I'd like to see an iPhone do that.
Good luck with managing your anxiety. It's not an easy thing to try and change, but once you figure out a way to you get that fancy new tool I mentioned (not for free, but won't cost you cash either).",GAD
1443,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
1444,"While both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Complex PTSD are both anxiety disorders, they are entirely different. Generalized Anxiety Disorder may have genetic roots and c-PTSD has roots in trauma.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder has symptoms similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other types of anxiety. These symptoms include constant worry, restlessness, and trouble with concentration. Treatment may include counseling and medications, such as antidepressants.
Complex PTSD is a type of PTSD that results from long-term trauma. Complex PTSD, however, is specific to severe, repetitive trauma that typically happens in childhood - most often abuse. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder is a condition where you experience some symptoms of PTSD along with some additional symptoms, such as:
difficulty controlling your emotions
feeling very hostile or distrustful towards the world
constant feelings of emptiness or hopelessness
feeling as if you are permanently damaged or worthless
feeling as if you are completely different to other people
feeling like nobody can understand what happened to you
avoiding friendships and relationships, or finding them very difficult
often experiencing dissociative symptoms such as depersonalisation or derealisation
regular suicidal feelings.",GAD
1445,"Sadly, only time will tell.
Picture this;
A bad thing happens. It’s terribly frightening and you think maybe this is it, you are gonna die. Somehow or another you don’t actually die and you have to live with what happened.
There are two outcomes that are most common in this situation.
The first is that for a while you are upset, scared, angry, sad etc, then you kinda find these symptoms are resolving and you get on with life more or less as it was before but you have learned something from the experience. - This is what you might be referring to as regular trauma induced depressiona nd anxiety.
The second is that the fear, the anxiety, the hypervigilance, the intrusive thoughts about the event and memories of it that are so real you would swear it was all happening again stay with you and don’t go away, and the ear and sadness that you feel about that start to superimpose themselves on other aspects of your life. - This is what you might refer to as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
There’s no real way to predict which one of these reactions you might get, but one or the other is likely.
Now picture this;
A bunch of really scary, like super threatening things that you think might kill you or in some way cause you irreparable harm happen to you. I mean a lot. Crappy things that you don’t deserve and that are not your fault happen again and again. Not even the same crappy thing, but a bunch of stuff that could only happen to you if there was no god or there was but he hated you, or if you were the worst person in the universe and then just for kicks you set a puppy on fire so you deserved it type of crap. Except your aren’t you are just a normal person (usually a kid) and just life is awful sometimes and bad stuff happens to good people.
That’s gonna affect you differently. It’s gonna make all of the changes to you that PTSD does, but it’s also gonna do stuff to the way you feel about yourself, and the way you expect to be treated by others. - That’s what you might call complex PTSD. If you end up with the whole self harming thing and the abject terror of impending abandonment you probably got it so bad they will call it EUPD.
In the end, it doesn’t really matter what you call it, or how exactly it came to happen to you. Remember that it is not your fault. You didn’t deserve it (mostly people don’t deserve the bad stuff that happens, or the good sometimes), and there is help available. It isn’t easy to do the work that needs to be done (esp. relating to C-PTSD or EUPD) but there are therapies that can help.",GAD

1447,"What is the difference in treatment between Complex PTSD and PTSD?
I have C-PTSD as well as PTSD.
C-PTSD means exposure to more than one trauma.

Working as a medic in Vietnam allowed me no other choice but to keep swimming in other soldiers' blood.",GAD
1448,"Ethically I need to start out by saying you should go to a mental health professional who specializes in trauma and get properly diagnosed. Now that I’ve said that here is what you can look for in yourself…….
Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD) comes from extended and sever childhood abuse/neglect. This could be from a dysfunctional family, if you grew up in a toxic cult, were a hostage, prisoner of war, and those who have been sexually exploited.
The abuse is sexual, verbal, emotional/psychological, spiritual, physical, and neglect. Now you can also have C-PTSD from being in an abusive intimate partner relationship. Many people who have suffered from an abusive adult relationship also had childhood abuse that they may or may not be aware of.
Mostly when we are talking about C-PTSD we are talking about it starting in childhood. Then it can resurface in adult relationships in later years where you can actually understand that something is wrong and it’s not just you. However, that isn’t always the case.
Five Features of C-PTSD
1) Emotional Flashbacks (emotions/feelings of shame, fear, anger, depression) Regression
2) Self-Abandonment: rejecting the self, feeling suicidal, self harm, self hatred
3) Toxic Shame: A feeling that you are worthless, stupid, flawed, unlovable,
4) Vicious Inner Critic: A voice telling you that you are worthless and flawed
5) Social Anxiety: Distrusting of others, paranoid, fearful of getting close to others
~Pete Walker
Here is a link to a more extensive list of characteristics one can have; I want to focus on explaining it instead of lists
Judith Herman and the formulation of C-PTSD
So….how do you know if you have C-PTSD after looking through both of these definitions?
For the majority of your life you believed that you were bad, inherently evil, unlovable, difficult, toxic, harmful to others, worthless. There was a feeling of why am I even alive. There was no feeling of self-compassion; you may have even put other’s feelings before your own. There was a deep dark hole inside of you that nothing you could do could fill it permanently. You felt full of rage, fearful, hopeless, powerless, shameful, and guilty.
You never felt seen, heard, or understood. Never truly connected or loved. It was difficult to feel real connection with people and you often wondered if anyone understood you. This could lead to a feeling of being special, unique, or utterly alone.
Many people with C-PTSD have waves of feeling suicidal. You may have struggled to tolerate the feelings of the internal loneliness and no one fully understanding you. You feel that you are to blame for everything that is wrong in relationships and your family. You vacillate between from being in a good place to a dark place when triggered by someone’s comment that triggers your toxic shame, easily. Toxic shame comes on like a bang. It hits hard and you regress to a child like stage.
Wanting to runaway from a conversation that has hurt your feeling, hurt the person back with words so they feel shameful, you may freeze and dissociate like a dear in headlights and you can’t move, or you may make attempts to please the person who has hurt you so they don’t think so ill of you. When triggered you may explode in rage, you can be highly reactive because of your sensitivity to flashbacks which remind you of the abuse you endured as a child (conscious or unconscious).
You are hypervigilant meaning you pick up on everything. Subtle changes in other’s moods, someone having an off day, feeling an unsafe situation (but ignore it usually), and noticing how people feel about you. You may be right, you may be wrong, but most of the time it feels that feelings you are picking up from others is negative about you. It’s hard to believe people like you.
You may have engaged in self harm either with physically hurting yourself, using drugs to regulate your emotions, dating abusive people, having toxic friends, not reaching your potential, putting yourself in dangerous situations. You may feel that you deserve to be punished, no one gives a Fuck why should you, you are trying to feel something or connected, you are may be escaping the suffering of the childhood trauma and these experience feel good (see my article on self harm).
You struggle to trust people. It’s difficult to let people in. You may be open but not vulnerable. Meaning at your time of need is when you isolate. You can go into a deep depression and isolate for a long time, fearful of the world and others after a flashback and then feelings of toxic shame. Here you dissociate, fantasize of being rescued, and wait for someone to save you. Usually people with C-PTSD have a lot of rescue fantasizes. They don’t feel capable of saving themselves or they simply need someone to love and care about them more than they do. They need to know someone cares if I’m alive or dead and daydream about someone saving them from themselves.
This makes them open to perpetrators who are abusive. Abusers love to act like the rescuer in the beginning and know exactly the part to play to a vulnerable person needing attention, to feel special, and seen/understood. Once in this relationship you feel a total lack of control and power. It’s not even on your radar that your being abused for a long long time and once you do there is a lack of agency that you can leave. You feel trapped and hopeless. The abuser, just like your parents made you to continue to believe that you are the problem, you are at fault, you are bad, difficult, mentally unstable, and unlovable (see my article on how to be responsible for the broken parts of us after abuse). That’s why it’s important to stay single until you’ve worked on your past. You should not be attractive to a healthy person when you are broken. A predator would see you as a perfect match however.
Lastly, life seems like a dream, not really living it, like you’re waiting for something to fix it and to be okay. You aren’t close to many people if any and struggle to trust anyone from the past or new in your life. You truly feel no one understands you, you are not understandable and fear that you will never truly connect with someone and feel safe with someone. It’s difficult to not self criticize everything you do and therefore you don’t let anyone in, in fear they will do the same and send you down an even deeper hole.
So you can look at a list of symptoms and see if those fit you, you can see a specialized trauma therapist, you can read up on C-PTSD by Pete Walker, Judith Herman, & Peter Levine to see if your childhood matches what they write about and see if you feel the way I wrote above. Doesn’t have to be a perfect fit but an over all feeling and then most likely you have C-PTSD. But if you had childhood abuse and are struggling to find self love, trust in relationships, have flashbacks, and vicious inner critic you most likely do.
Please get help if you feel this way. I will say that there is so much hope with C-PTSD and more everyday. I write about this in my other article. You are not doomed to feel this way forever, you will struggle but we all do, you will have relapses but we all do. Understanding your childhood abuse or intimate partner abuse is so important and then doing body work since your body has been traumatized too. There is another side of C-PTSD that is peaceful, stable, helpful to others, being a beautiful parent and partner. Do not give up, there is hope I promise. I am a C-PTSD survivor and I have lots of hope. We can do good with this trauma and help each other so we don't repeat more toxic relationships.
This was not your fault, ever, you are not bad, evil, broken, or bad. You were abused. Period. That will destroy people for a time, but not forever warriors.",GAD
1449,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1450,"The anxiety I have suffered has been regularly described as high-functioning. It can still be severely debilitating, but I believe there are a number of factors at play here that one can identify to be classified as “highly-functioning”. I’ll just go from my experience here, since there really is no accepted definition (i.e. it is not an official DSM diagnosis).
You are likely to enter into anxiety-provoking situations or often choose not to avoid them
You can hide your symptoms quite well in social and professional situations
You can focus on very important tasks with some level of concentration even during high levels of anxiety
Your symptoms of anxiety, though severe, can change within the span of days or weeks to almost disappear entirely
You are very good at analysing, describing and categorizing the effects of anxiety on yourself and others
You tend not to give in to sudden impulses that your anxiety may urge you to do, even with major life situations (i.e. quit a job etc.)
It is generally more difficult for your anxiety to invoke depression or feelings of hopelessness and you can maintain a high self-esteem
You can still keep up with daily routine tasks to some level of proficiency",GAD
1451,"🧩Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by uncontrollable worry, a constant sense of dread or anticipation of disaster. Persistent feelings of restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances and muscle tension are symptoms of GAD. Excessive worry about health, school, relationships or one’s future is common but often the source of worry is hard to identify. This uncontrollable worry lasts at least six months and can lead to impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Sometimes the worry can be so severe that it can lead to a panic attack.
🏋🏾‍♂️Excessive worry and anxiety that occurs more days than not about various events or activities
❤️The worry is difficult to control, that is, the person cannot stop worrying and move their minds onto other matters
🏋🏾‍♂️The worry is accompanied by other symptoms, such as restlessness, feeling easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and irritability
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may occur in the aftermath of a traumatic event such as a serious accident, sexual or physical assault, or war. Individuals with PTSD often experience intense fear or stress even after the actual threat is past. They may also have intense feelings of helplessness, flashbacks or intrusive thoughts of the event, trouble sleeping or nightmares, guilt, increased arousal or a need to avoid situations associated with the trauma. These symptoms can appear weeks, months or even years after the event.
Re-experiencing (i.e., replaying) the traumatic event
Avoiding reminders related to the trauma
Negative thoughts and worry
Heightened anxiety
Increased psychological and physical reactivity
Irritable mood and possible anger outbursts
Problems with concentration
Sleep disturbance
Due to stress factor in both the cases.. The latter one erupts from a memory or an emotion /feeling state and is environment driven expecially toxic.. Brain takes a snap shot of the event and store it it then uses these images or video as a filter to scan the threats that matches with the stored data..

1453,"The American National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder i fixates that those who suffer from Complex Trauma can also experience significant disruptions in the following areas in addition to the regular symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD);
Emotional Regulation. Complex trauma survivors can struggle with feelings of; depression, suicidal ideation as well as extreme rage.
Consciousness. Essentially reliving traumatic events, feeling disassociated from the trauma, their bodies, the world and/or experience problems with accessing memories of the trauma.
Self-Perception. Survivors carry a sense of toxic shame, helplessness and a feeling of “separateness” from others, of being different and defective due to the trauma. This can become compounded through the experience of ‘emotional flashbacks’ whereby persons will experience intense feelings that were originally felt during the trauma, such as fear, shame, sadness or despair.
Distorted Perceptions of the Perpetrator. This becomes evident through depersonalisation and derealisation. Complex trauma survivors have an ambivalent relationship to their perpetrators which is an indication of trauma bonding.
Relations with Others. Complex trauma survivors can become socially withdrawn and self-isolate.
One’s System of Meanings. The loss of hope often occurs within a complex trauma survivor whereby a sense of hopelessness interferes with their sense of meaning resulting is a further loss of confidence leading to the formation of the perception of life feeling meaningless all of which result from a distinctive lack of being able to receive proper care, affection, and authentic connection.
Trauma interferes with parts of the brain that deal with learning, decision-making and memory. Complex trauma survivors endure not only visual flashbacks of the trauma but also “emotional flashbacks” that cause them to regress back to the emotional states of hopelessness where they first encountered the original wounds (Walker, 2013).

1454,"Trauma takes 3 forms - acute, chronic, complex.
Acute is like an electric shock, it becomes very bad very fast, the mind and body is on the verge of collapse. This is the most life threatening kind. Within two weeks, someone is unrecognisable. Fainting is quite common so are drastic life changes like agoraphobia, heart attacks and strokes are common too, so is suicide.
Chronic is high in frequency, such as anxious in all areas of life. Think width, not depth. Usually suicide ideation with no plans to do it. It’s feeling trapped, bouncing between many rocks and many hard places.
Complex is multiple intersections, think depth not width. One struggle has many complications, digging deep to find the root cause is the solution.
For example childhood trauma, dad is a workaholic who thinks mental illness can be solved by self determination and go as far as to think that only morally incorrect people who’re weak and lazy, will be mentally ill. He can’t be mentally ill since he’s hardworking and strong in his own eyes.
Mom became an alcoholic, since dad as the sole breadwinner, refuses to provide funds for “frivolous” pursuits like going for therapy or prescribed medications. These are medical essentials for mom, so she was driven to self medicating as a last desperate resort.
One sibling is autistic, one is mentally ill, the “don’t have it bad enough” one who is healthy, is expected to caregive for entire family or is despised. Everyone’s feelings matter except hers, she is set up to fail, she has to be an expert in autism, mental illnesses that vary for each family member and do rehab for two addicts who recklessly endanger the appointed “saviour” by parents.
There’s usually a crossover, one of the reason why people go in for therapy is to let a professional gauge immediate threat levels and provide emergency triage if necessary.
People can also faint and hit their heads, have permanent irreversible brain damage. Even dizziness that causes disorientation can become a life or death threat.
Millions of neurons are lost with every minute of stroke, in 5 mins, that person can become brain dead. Cardiovascular issues is one of many concerns when it comes to adults with childhood trauma.
Most people have preexisting medical issues, often undiagnosed. So the many small routine things we do to stay healthy, when push comes to shove, is going to save someone’s life.
A mind and body can’t fight as well to stay alive, in a weakened state, I bet loads of tragic deaths during the pandemic is due to poor health caused by unresolved trauma.
Immune system issues, nervous system issues, GI issues, the entire body is weakened daily.
Not everything is reversible is something that many lay people don’t get. Pass a certain point, only palliative care is possible, not a cure.
This is why early intervention saves money and preserves quality of life, a delay can alter someone’s life permanently.
Brain bleeds due to accidental falls, especially for a child’s developing brain, can cause someone to be permanently disabled.

1457,"What is Cumulative or Complex PTSD?
C-PTSD is a mental health condition that develops after multiple, traumatic events, often over the course of an extended period of time. It is different from PTSD in that the latter can be triggered from a single event. An example of this would be a soldier in combat, who sees his best friend get killed. For C-PTSD, police officers, fire fighters, coroners and emergency room personnel are all examples of professions that have a high rate of C-PTSD developing.
Those professions often see mutilated bodies, including the most grotesque forms of death. They see children that have had their brains blown out, crushed in a traffic collision, or burned alive in a house fire. Those repeated visuals can chip away at your psyche, and C-PTSD manifests because of it. I know this first hand, because as a CSI/Forensic Scientist, I am the one that has to take pictures on a crime scene, and those photos can haunt you forever. The smell of death and decay stays with you. It can permeate your hair and clothes, which is why we have showers in our lab, and I keep a fresh uniform in my locker.
Another group of people that can develop C-PTSD, are those who have suffered repeated abuse over an extended period of time. That abuse can come from home, such as an abusive parent or spouse, or, it can come from external sources, such as a school bully, co-worker, etc. The last thing that we want is for someone to commit suicide because they have suffered at the hands of a bully.

Regular PTSD is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This happens when someone is exposed to more stress or horror than they can handle. For example, soldiers often get PTSD from seeing too much death and carnage on the battlefield, especially if it happens to a buddy.
Complex PTSD happens when either:
someone gets multiple cases of PTSD. For example, a soldier comes home only to find their house burned down and all their family died. Or,
when someone is exposed to the same stress for a really long time. A soldier sees 3 or 4 years straight of daily combat). Or,
both.
In extreme cases, C-PTSD looks something like this.
A soldier sees 4 years of straight combat then comes home to find their family dead in a house fire. So they get hooked on drugs for 2 years, and get thrown into prison where they're raped.
And oops. Turns out that the prosecutor made a mistake and the soldier was actually innocent of that particular charge and shouldn't have been jailed on the first place.

Hello
We have a natural defence mechanism called fight or flight against any external threat to us. Whenever we are triggered of a threat, a hormone called Cortisol is released in our blood. This increases our heart beat rate and blood pressure. Diverts blood from our internal organs to our brain and limbs. Dialets our pupils and makes us more alert. In other words makes us battle ready to face the external threat.
If we are triggered frequently and then there is no external threat to react with. The Cortisol level in our blood becomes high and it gives us stress or anxiety, which after some time after the hormone is metabolised goes away. In anxiety one feels very restless, fearful, jittery, uncomfortable, negative thoughts, etc.
Now Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD is a mental health disorder. It requires professional help to overcome. It's similar to anxiety but on a 24X7 basis even without triggers.
GAD can be treated by consulting a psychiatrist for checking, diagnosis and prescription of medicines. Another way of treatment can be consulting a CBT Therapist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, talk therapy, which is as effective as medicines.
Regular exercise and meditation, pranayama, also helps in allivieating anxiety levels along with adoption of relaxation techniques.
All the best.",GAD
1461,"The simple answer is that Complex PTSD is more complex than PTSD, and is harder to treat and recover from.
Complex PTSD shares the same symptoms as PTSD but has additional symptoms on top of that which are specific to cPTSD. It is often misdiagnosed with other mental illness such as Borderline Personality Disorder. It is caused by multiple sustained trauma over time—often a mix of different types of abuse and traumatic events—whereby the person is helpless to escape or stop the abuse/neglect. This could be a kidnap victim or survivor of human trafficking held in captivity over a long period of time, or a child growing up with various traumas, most commonly different types of abuse and/or neglect. Concerning the latter, if the child is subjected to abuse or ongoing trauma in the early years when their brain is just starting to develop, it causes the brain not to wire properly, which will negatively affect that person's entire life without knowledgeable competent help. Something hard to find by the way.
In addition to more complex symptoms, the adult trauma survivor will find little to no social/emotional support due to the “pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps“ mentality of America. Also they will find it difficult to obtain competent mental health help and will often be unable to afford it. cPTSD takes an average of 10 years of solid therapy by a highly skilled and knowledgeable therapist in order to recover. insurance companies have limits that fall far short of what they need to have any kind of life. Since it's yet to be recognized by the DSM, even if you're lucky enough to afford treatment, the majority of mh practitioners are not current or trained on treating it properly or don't even recognize CPTSD. We have a long way to go to educate both the public and mental practitioners about trauma and how it develops into Complex PTSD as well as personality disorders and other mental illnesses. Until then, sufferers will continue to suffer and be judged by society for not being able to” just get on with their lives”.
In closing, it's always amazed me that people can easily see how the trauma that a soldier might experience could cause them to develop PTSD (or cPTSD), but will then turn around and judge the abuse Survivor for not being able to just get over it. We can't just get over it and neither would you if you were dealing with the lasting effects of repetitive chronic trauma.",GAD
1462,"Without going into psychologist-speak, generalized anxiety is constant worry that you can’t control about several things. Some people with it have sore muscles and it affects a person's ability to relax, concentrate, and enjoy life. There is constant tension. It can prevent you from working, having good relationships with others, getting decent grades at school and it is more miserable than normal anxiety. Some people can’t even enjoy going on a relaxing vacation because of it.
I am not going into all the other types of illness because some mental illnesses do cause a person to have constant worry but it is not the same type of feeling as generalized anxiety. Also, that would be too long and technical to enjoyably read.

For example a person got into a car accident after asking the driver to slow down and not speed for months. Her life flashed before her eyes, she thought OMG this is it, I’m going to die. I’M NOT READY TO DIE was the much louder voice.
That voice is the inner crisis manager part kicking in, she kicked into high alert fight mode, grabbed the handle at the side, seatbelt was already on (thank god) and braced herself for any potential impact.
The car spun out of control, careened across 3 lanes in a rainy foggy early morning, no cars crashed into them but one tyre went up the pavement.
After what seems like forever, it stopped cold.
Kind soul construction workers came out into the rain, to help push the car down. She also hopped out, along with the driver, joining forces with them. Thanking them profusely, they quickly got back in, it’s not safe in the middle of nowhere.
When they got to the destination, both still in a state of shock, she bursted into tears and confronted the driver.
The driver trivialised and minimised how traumatic it was, she felt all alone.
She knew it was an accident but it could have been prevented, she tried to prevent it.
Conditioned at a young age to be a people pleaser, she felt helpless under pressure, when someone accused her of nagging, over reacting and scolded her like her parents did to her, she disassociated (CPTSD) and the conversation got nowhere.
The idea to leave the person didn’t even cross her mind (dysfunctional childhood to adulthood dynamics).
It was the same as when she tried to tell her dad that mom was starving her, her dad trivialised and minimised it, he can’t wrap his head around how mother instincts would let a woman starve her kids.
He only saw an abundance of food for dinner, her being picky about it or scoffing everything down at warped speed. His impression was that she was greedy, cold and a brat.
When she was starving and can’t think of anything like greet her dad but food. The danger (our bodies read starvation as endangerment) of the entire day made her lose her appetite so her stomach was growling but the increased pressure of her dad insisting she showed him affection first, she was condition to ignore own survival needs.
The same danger signals that she sensed in a fast car and the same need for safety around the driver, both invoked irrational shame and guilt.
Her mom used to punish her for complaining about not enough food, she would body shame her constantly. She would guilt trip her when she was too stressed out to finish her food and mistook it for too much food.
She also saw it as disliking her cooking and insulting her, called her ungrateful.
She was too hungry to think about how the food even taste, she’s just shoveling it in. When you get one meal a day, you make the best of it.
She internalised it into she was a bad wrong person for having these needs, children are seen and not heard. She was conditioned daily to ignore her own survival needs and told that protesting when endangered was being disobedient.
So, yes, it can coexist, it’s usually intertwined.
PTSD is usually once off events, CPTSD is usually repetitive, with the same people, same conditions, for example a traumatic childhood that last 18 to 21 years. Or a toxic job that someone does for years, an abusive adult relationship that lasted for years.
There’re close to a few hundred ways that people can be traumatised, it’s easier if you match up the symptoms of both and see if it fits for you.
Don’t invalidate yourself even if it comes as a shock, most people don’t know they have trauma.",GAD

General anxiety is normal and in fact, is healthy. You can feel anxious before an interview or a really important exam, it's completely normal. This feeling of anxiety helps you to be prepared and be more confident and cautious.
GAD, on the other hand, is being anxious ALL THE TIME. And for nothing.
It's having these irrational thoughts and fears in your mind.
It’s all in your head.
Fun Fact: YOU actually know that it is! You know that all your fears are baseless.
Besides affecting you emotionally and physically (racing heartbeat, sweating, breathing problems etc.), it affects your life, to a large extent. This anxiety makes you think you’re sad when you’re not. It convinces you that you’re depressed, and you actually end up with depression because of that. With GAD comes a lot of other bad stuff. Insomnia is one of them. You either sleep a lot or don't sleep at all! Eating disorders follow sometimes too. You’re anxious over something for like 3 months or more when it’s not even that serious. You feel like a living paradox because you feel a lot of emotions and no emotion at all, at once!
Living with GAD is suffocating.
General anxiety is healthy.

1465,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1466,"People with anxiety feel okay, fine most of the time. I had not beign diagnosed with anxiety. I'm sure I have it. I do not considerate I have a generalized anxiety. As is something that come unexpected and last a few minutes up to 20 minutes. And is not happening every day. If not a twice per month.
Started right after my husband passed away. Come unexpectedly. How do I know I have it? I recognize it. Start out of nowhere. If I'm in a place where I had to wait for a while longer in line. If I'm looking at something specific ( will not tell) usually I started to move one of my legs non stop for a minute. I can control the leg movement. When I start to move it and when to stop it. Is my way to cope with that sudden anxious feeling. Like when you rock slowly back and forth a child to console. I think moving the leg is the same for a anxious person. Is a copying mechanism.
I had witnessed people do this leg movement in public and in restaurants . A family was having dinner. The male in the family shacked his legs non stop. Looks out of place to be doing that.
Well, is a sign the person do not like to wait, is in a hurry for something or is anxious. I have days when I feel great. I had days when all seems fine, and later on in the same day . I started to felt anxious out of nowhere. Without nothing triggers that.
I have an enormous amount of energy. If I don't release it. Can be overwhelming. So, is important to letting out the excess of energy. Exercises is the answer to me.
I would recommend to take a warm/hot bath. Do exercises like walking, dancing, cycling. I had never tried Yoga. I think could be a good idea for someone else to do. Drink a relaxing or antistress tea.",GAD

1468,"OK, it’s gonna sound strange but anxiety doesn’t start in the head, it starts in the guts. The second brain.
95 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the bowels. Serotonin is nothing less than the “happiness hormone” or the “love hormone”.
I want you to bear with me and then go on and verify the information on your own.
Neurotransmitters are produced in the gut
Well “only” 95% of them.
Did you know that the guts have brain cells and they actually can grow new ones ?
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your gut biome, it reflects in your brain.
When there’s a chemical unbalance in your physical brain, it reflects on your thoughts.
We have this feeling that anxiety is a problem of the brain… well because that’s the device we use to generate thoughts, right?!
Wrong! It starts way down there.
Best advice I came along
I’m no doctor but I know how to research and test for myself.
I actually started by curing my liver and that’s what lead me on this whole path.
Back in February of this year, I watch someone I trust telling me to take serious protein for breakfast.
What does “serious protein” mean? It means to change the sources you usually see in the good books.
I started with whey protein but I had to stop since I don’t digest it well. That’s something that happens with dairy products.
I moved to eggs… and wow!
I started to eat 3 eggs every morning and I sticked at it for 2 months.
BTW, this is something you need to internalize. These methods are not treating the symptoms, so they take time to work.
I first noticed a change in my mood 2 months after starting.
I was less anxious but I didn’t noticed it because I always focused on the symptom, I use to have a very bad temper. Awfully, I used to think that it was me, I was made like that.
Now, It’s November and it’s almost 10 months that I started this diet.

My coping skills include: relaxation breathing, 54321 technique, reading, writing, painting, journaling, talk to someone in my family, music- playing and listening, exercise…basically anything that helps me decompress and refocus.

I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
1471,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
1472,"Because we have jobs, marriages, children, homes, schooling, etc etc that all need to be protected, and we rightly believe that if people knew about our anxiety, we could be fired or rejected or abandoned or suspended. We know that because we’ve already experienced this; now we are sensitized, and all we can do is hide it, until it progresses so far, we can’t hide anymore, and either succumb to treatment or lose everything and age miserably. Maybe these beliefs are true, perhaps not, but that is how GA affects beliefs. And many of us don’t even realize free-floating anxiety is not a baseline state; I didn’t know until late-30’s.
One of the coolest women i ever met became my best friend for years. Once she told me that the first thing that happens when she awakens is an overwhelming desire to end her life consumes her … every single day! Then she had to take measures to shake it off and not give in to the impulse. I’m very perceptive of human behavior, micro expressions, body language, voice tones, and so on,as all MDs in my field learn, but there was no hint with her. All her feelings were under permanent lock-down; later she confessed her anxiety had also caused alcoholism, so she had to deal with that as well. I never even knew.
It was the strangest feeling in the world to have the anxiety lift; it took a lot of getting used to. Every aspect of my perception changed, along with outlook. And there emerged so much emotional and physical energy that used to be consumed by anxieties, phobias, flashbacks….
Anxiety is one condition that qualified MDs can really alleviate these days. They can sort out the diagnostics and treatment plans and adjust medications if needed, and then I believe therapy is mandatory if the patient can benefit; the therapist will let a patient know if they think no more progress can be achieved., but that is unusual, as talk/education/understanding really help remission.
And I support any holistic measures that can also alleviate anxiety. I find lavender, sage, and sandalwood scents really mellow me out. And of course the obvious: sleep, nutrition, exercise, pleasant socializing, etc. And if we live alone, pets are a wonderful addition to these measures. I acquired a rescue cat that was abandoned and she ended up being my very best companion; she seems to know exactly when I need comfort and otherwise, she’s exploring the neighborhood. I know a lawyer that was awarded a service dog she can take with her anywhere; she can’t go anywhere without him, so puppy allows her to function very well.
Finally, there are ways to acquire musical pieces that are designed to lower anxiety. I can play them right on my computer through Google. The science of sound is an area being studied extensively, as we are learning certain types of music/sound can lower anxiety or increase energy, awareness, etc. My cat was traumatized severely, so she suffers too when it is storming because she was abandoned and then suffered weeks of monsoon weather howling all that time; she finally wandered onto my deck, but would not eat or drink anything, not leave my side for a second, could not sleep. My husband is the one that thought of music, and sure enough, I played the “cat tranquility” music and she relaxed and passed out in about 20 seconds; it was like frikkin magic. She immediately started eating, drinking, and slowly becoming independent. That was a great lesson for me; music designed to treat conditions is advancing quickly.",GAD
1473,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1475,"Experience. I’ve had decades of dealing with it to learn that it is just noise. It’s uncomfortable, it’s unpleasant, it really sucks, but it will pass eventually just like it always has before. I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence. If there was a pill I could take to make it go away, or even to numb it temporarily, I would do so, but not if it came at the expense of being me. Alas my body has responded very poorly to every pharmaceutical I’ve tried so far to alleviate my conditions, to the point where I now have anxiety-induced symptoms at the mere thought of trying a new drug. So I’ve resigned myself to just living as best I can with the constant noise of pain and anxiety. When it gets really bad, I tell it, “Bring it on, let’s do this!” It will pass, and I’m stronger than it is, and I know this because I’ve been through it so many times before. It hasn’t killed me yet.",GAD

There is no one-size-fits-all solution available for any problem - mental or physical. Our pain thresholds, level of consciousness and depth of understanding of the problem determines what would work, how effectively something would work and how much time healing would take. This is my general realization in life.
There is absolutely nothing that would work better than meditation and mindfulness practice to heal from anxiety or/and depression. Having said that, medications are sometimes necessary, but they shouldn't be the only strategy. They should be an SOS means not treatment.
I have had panic attacks, social anxiety, general anxiety that manifested to also cause digestive problems. So, I had to try a multipronged approach because one trigger cascades into a multiple chain of gradual breakdowns - physical and emotional.
I can list down some ways that I've been employing:
Identify triggers: first and foremost is to be able to pinpoint exactly what situations, people, thoughts and conversations trigger anxiety in you. There might be certain people you need to avoid or some situations that you currently find triggering to address. The objective being to avoid, if possible, or reduce exposure to them for the time being.
Self-soothing: this is one practice they should teach in schools. Most of us do not know how to deal with our emotional outbursts. People develop unhealthy coping mechanisms without ever coming to terms with it. For instance, I have developed the habit of having one person on call whenever I am triggered -anxious, angry or restless. This seems harmless but in the long run, is indubitably a sign of co-dependency that needs to be avoided. A healthier way would be to journal, record my feelings, use mindfulness exercises and practice distracting thoughts during such crisis situations. The clear objective being able to properly contain and redirect anxious feelings or thoughts when they arise without having other people get negatively impacted. I have used mindfulness coloring, distracting thoughts, faith practice, self-affirming thoughts, CBT skills, but I still fail sometimes and it's alright. I'm trying to be a healthy human and not a robust robot. Please be kind to yourself.
Meditation and mindfulness practice: This is the ultimate means to truly find who you are and learn to accept and love yourself. It can act as your guide and willpower because that's what really breaks down during anxiety. The ground crumbles under ones feet and sucks one in like quicksand. That's when all the voices seem farther away and inner demons take over. If I'm alive today, it is because of the amount of faith I developed. It's a process, but that's how I have found my path for healing. Whatever it is you can find your faith in and form a practice, please do.
CBT skills: This probably sounds repetitive but cognitive behavioral therapy skills are effective for everyone. Anxiety is body's natural response to fear, threat and danger. CBT can train one to identify triggers, develop healthy coping skills and develop emotional intelligence. Whatever way you can access CBT, please give it a shot.
Support system: Having few friends who understand what you are going through and can provide emotional outlet in times of need is the backbone for healthy mental and emotional life. Of course, it's important to maintain healthy boundaries and not form dependence on people but ultimately, as human beings, we also have a need for finding a sense of belongingness and comfort that can only be met by human connections.
In conclusion, having healthy coping attached, support systems, faith and mindulfulness practice as well as CBT skills can help one build confidence and cope with anxiety. Journaling, music, dance and color therapy also help you live healthy and become functional in society.
All the best.",GAD

1478,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1479,"This is an interesting question because of how it's phrased. It sounds as though GAD is something that can go away and reappear, like a cold or a stomach bug.
However, I think that's a false premise for my own reasons, so take my response with a grain of salt.
I myself was diagnosed with GAD at seven years old. I know how overwhelming and incapacitating it can be. Especially when you have an “anxiety attack"". Through my own experiences both inside and outside of therapy when I was seventeen until age twenty-two, I learned a LOT about myself and about personal development. I am even in school to learn about psychological counseling.
This is all leading up to my take on mental illness. It isn't my belief that it is helpful to think of such complex emotional and mental issues as “illnesses"". That implies that the underlying processes are something that one can be “cured"" of. Personally, I prefer the terms dysfunction or disorder, but I digress…
Rather than address GAD as something that comes and goes, I think it's more accurate to say that it's more or less a part of yourself; perhaps a byproduct of your particular patterns of thinking and behaving. Your environment, including the way you handle your relationships, is a large influence as well.
When you ask about being “normal"" that depends on your understanding of what healthy and functional behavior looks like. Is it living without the anxiety because you've “gotten rid of it""? Or is it learning how to manage your thoughts, behavior, and environment to the best of your ability so that you experience significantly less anxiety?
Obviously, my response is more biased toward a particular approach. As I can only offer my perspective from my own experiences. I suggest that the most important thing is for you to figure out what a “normal"" life would look like. Then you can make determinations on how to achieve that.
I hope my response was valuable to you. Hang in there… I want you to know that you have what it takes to get to a better place. Good luck.",GAD
1480,"Yes. But …
I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.
To summarize, I believe most who suffer from GAD have “anxiety attacks,” but not necessarily panic attacks.",GAD
1481,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD

1483,"I'm like this but I genuinely don’t understand why so I’m going to assume
Maybe because we’re scared and kinda on the defense side around others and have our guard up and listening so I think our minds self-defense kick in since we’re scared so anything could make us upset as we’re on the defense seeing anything as a threat or something we need to worry about like for me I either scratch my hands till they become red or fidget with my fingers and when anyone talks to me I’m already just a bit annoyed and I’m not showing it but when they say a small thing that would annoy me I overreact a bit since I’m already stress and worried more than the stress and worry I have is like inflating my stress ballon the more you inflate it the less stretchy it gets and closer it gets to popping and easier to pop.",GAD

Social interaction: A support system plays an important role to overcome GAD Social interaction with people who can be trusted is effective in calming the nervous system thus reducing anxiety. It could be a family member or friend. Build a strong social network and interact to avoid being in isolation. Avoid situations or people who make you feel negative or anxious.
Lifestyle modifications: These changes include change in the sleep pattern, diet, regular exercises, limiting the intake of alcohol and caffeine.

1486,"You have had a miscommunication somewhere. generalized anxiety disorder is what you're talking about. your generally anxious all the time. it doesn't take something to trigger your anxiety. you just are. the only difference is what level are you. are you mild? are you moderate ?are you acute? Anxiety is anxiety. the only difference is how strongly does it affect you? does it keep you awake? does it make it difficult concentrating on things? doesn't make you really bouncy, and twitchy, you can't stay still for more than a few seconds at a time? it's part of an adult deficit disorder or whatever they call it now. basically, generalized anxiety means you're anxious all the time, and there's no reason for you to be that way. there's no trigger that shot you off that way. you just are that way all the time. It's no fun, I can tell you, because I do it myself. I am always running in my mind. I am running so hard and so fast that if my body tried to catch up to it I'd be beating Speedy Gonzalez (or even the flash)to a standstill. And that's when I'm lucky enough to get some sleep. the rest of time I'm going even faster, and it's wearing on a body. but there are medications that will help you slow down, ease up, learn how to relax, and also there's apps on the phone like that calm, or I can't think of what the other ones are called. but you know what I'm talking about, it's okay. A lot of people have it, it doesn't make you weird or strange, it just means that your mind goes faster than the average person's and sometimes you have a hard time keeping up. no biggie, everyone has a problem, they just don't admit it, and that's the first thing about getting better. getting it under control, is admitting you have a problem, and you need help. I hope everyone out there is listening to me, because if you don't get help you get worse, and if you get worse you could hurt yourself, or someone else, and we don't want to do that, now, do we? bye-bye",GAD
1487,"There is some evidence that CBD can be used to help alleviate anxiety and help reduce the severity of a panic attack, yet there is also evidence that there is no affect on the anxiety or panic attacks as well. If you believe it may help you, then you can try and see if it is a placebo effect, it doesn't work, or if it genuinely helps. HOWEVER, it is important to discuss it with your primary care physician in order to ensure that there are no side effects with any medication that you currently are taking.
CBD is not psychoactive in any way. The psychoactive part is called THC. THC has a possibility of making your anxiety and panic attacks worse depending on the strain of marijuana. It could cause, what one might say is, a “traumatic” experience. In short for THC, if you have anxiety I recommend indica strains. Sativa strains are the ones that trigger anxiety. They have a saying in the marijuana community,
“Indica= In da couch.”
Sativa is more for an energetic feeling.
Also, be warned! ⚠️
If you have a job where you are regularly drug tested, you may want to steer clear of CBD. Though it is extremely small (most are 0.03% I believe,) there is still THC in the product. CBD has a possibility of having you test positive for regular marijuana.",GAD

1492,"If you have high-anxiety, anything can trigger panic attacks, not just CBD oil. You can have a glass of water and have a panic attack. I used to smoke a lot of weed when I was a teenager but one time, I went into a full blown panic attack, I became paranoid and started having hallucinations and that went on for a couple of hours. That’s when I decided to stop smoking weed and I started blaming it for my “panic attacks”. However, even without taking CBD or smoking weed, I experienced lighter panic attacks many years later which was a complete shock because I didn’t think I would ever face a panic attack without being on something. Well, let me tell you that I was wrong. So, I went to see a psychologist and told him about my experience with the panic attacks and the weed to which he replied: “The substance isn’t what caused them, but we need to dig deeper to find out why you had them in the first place”. That sentence resonated in my head ever since. In other words, CBD or weed won’t necessarily trigger anything if you’re in the right place inside your head, but if you aren’t, then you have to search deeper and find out the root cause. However, if you’re an anxious person, stay away from CBD or weed. I know they are two different things but my point is that you shouldn’t do anything that would make you feel uncomfortable. However, if you think you’ll be okay, then go for it.",GAD
1493,"CBD has helped me greatly with my anxiety.
I’ve always had some level of anxiety/social anxiety since my teens. Sometimes was worse than others but I’ve always just kind of rode it out.
After the better part of a decade working 12 hours shifts in a high-stress environment, mostly overnight, along with other lifes goings ons, I tried medication after noticing that my anxiety just kept getting worse after a few months instead of the regular roller-coaster effect it normally went through. I also had an insomnia problem from my inconsistent sleep schedule. Two different medications made me just feel disconnected from my emotions and mind, I didn’t like it at all and would rather have anxiety than feel like that.
Looking into holistic remedies, I discovered CBD. I noticed a slight improvement with the first product I tried, then after doing a little more research and landing a high quality (and very expensive) product, it worked so well that it felt weird to feel normal again. It also vastly helped my sleep quality using full-spectrum near bedtime.
It’s not going to just turn your anxiety off like a switch, but it will definitely improve the condition for most people with the right product, the right dose, and consistent use.
I personally take 33mg of broad spectrum after my morning coffee, then another 33mg of full spectrum around 7/8PM and I’ve yet to fall back into the deep anxiety pit for over a year now. Some times when I’m having a bad day, I’ll take an extra dose.
The body is a very complex biomechanical machine where pretty much everything you do sets off some kind of response to upset the delicate balance. Activation of your endocannabinoid system certainly lends to your mental health but you should also focus on sleep, exercise, and your gut health as well. The combination of all these things has really help me to take full control of my anxiety.

1494,Before getting off any psychiatric medication consult with your Dr. My guess is your Dr will be against it especially if the current treatment is working well and you are stable. I did a similar thing when I was on Zoloft and Lamictal. I started smoking marijuana in the evening and my mental health improved dramatically. This was not just the CBD. I did wean off all of my meds and was stable for 2 years using marijuana alone. I told my Dr that I was going to wean off the drugs and he was against it. Unfortunately I developed a reaction to the marijuana and couldn’t use it daily anymore. I did try a high CBD Charlottes Web oil as well as a couple other full spectrum CBD products but unfortunately CBD didn’t work on my depression at all. I also need the THC.

1495,"Depends. How bad is your anxiety?
A few years ago, I was sponsored by a CBD company for Jiu-Jitsu. They paid me some money, gave me a shit ton of free CBD stuff, and told me to post about their stuff on social media.
It was my first sponsorship. I even got a discount code and everything.
I was 22-years-old, a senior in college, and very, very broke, so I wrote a nice post for the company and told my friends, family, followers, and teammates to buy some CBD.
However, I was pretty disappointed in the product once I actually started using it.
I learned a lot about being a sponsored athlete from this experience, and afterward, I promised myself that I’d never work with a brand that I didn’t actually want to support.
Even while I was sponsored by these people, I never posted about effective I thought CBD was because it never worked for me when it came to decreasing anxiety or inflammation.
I have pretty severe anxiety (I used to live in constant derealization due to my anxiety) and my depression used to be pretty severe too, so I figured I’d be a great case study of how effective CBD can be for mental health.
I also have a lot of chronic injuries from a lifetime of martial arts training and competition, and I used to struggle with pretty bad stress-induced insomnia when I was in college.
The truth is, CBD didn’t do much of anything for me, but if I used a fuck ton of it, I got kind of sleepy. It didn’t really cure my anxiety, but it was good for a few afternoon naps.
What did help my anxiety, my depression, and my insomnia was lowering my daily stress levels.
There is evidence that CBD works, but it’s embellished.
I’ve found plenty of other methods to help my anxiety besides using CBD.
Mindfulness. Writing. Lowering life stress. Working out. Eating healthy. Sleeping enough. Not surrounding yourself with lunatics.
Do that instead.
Plus, CBD is usually way more expensive than it needs to be, anyway.",GAD
1496,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy

1499,"You’ll need medication.
If you’re suffering from Panic Disorder be sure to talk to a psychiatrist near you. You won’t be able to handle it on your own, but you also need to understand that no pill will solve everything, and it certainly won’t be an easy (or quick) fix. Medication can help you in the long run by helping to tackle your panic attacks, but after that you’ll still need to deal with it psychologically. My experience was having around 10 panic attacks within 24 hours, not sleeping, not eating, living my life in a single chair, watching the same shows, playing the same games, and generally just hiding from everything. After I got my panic attacks under control, I needed to re-train my brain to get out of the cycle and the little world which I had made. Even now I’m still getting over it, challenging myself to do things, breaking habits that I formed through my experience, etc.
An important thing to do is to reach out to friends or family and talk about what you’re going through — they can help you. Without the support of my family, I would have fallen into pits so deep that I couldn’t have been able to get out.
On top of that, there are all kinds of other things you can do to help tackle anxiety. Obviously everyone is different, for me two of the most helpful things were deep-breathing techniques and herbal teas.
Try researching about the condition, you might find it’ll help you feel like you can understand things a little better.",GAD
1500,"Hey there, thanks for asking the question. Cannabinoids found in cannabis sativa plant have various therapeutic benefits including relief from symptoms of GAD, sleep disorders, nerve pain, and more…
Here the choice between Indica and Sativa strains for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is often a matter of personal preference and individual response.
One one hand, Indica, often associated with relaxation and sedation, indicas are thought to be more effective for treating physical discomfort, pain, and insomnia. Some individuals with GAD may find that indica strains helps them calm down and reduce the anxiety symptoms.
On other hand, generally perceived as more uplifiting and energizing, sativas are often used to improve mood and boost creativity. While they may not be as immediately sedating as indicas, some people with GAD find that sativa strains can help alleviate anxiety and promote a sense of well-being.
Here's a simplified explanation of how cannabinoids might work for GAD:
Neurotransmitter Regulation: Cannabinoids can interact with receptors in the brain that regulate neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are involved in mood, anxiety, and stress response.
Reduced Amygdala Activity: The amygdala is a part of the brain associated with fear and anxiety. Some research suggests that cannabinoids may help reduce the activity of the amygdala, potentially leading to a decrease in anxiety symptoms.
Anti-inflammatory Effects: Cannabinoids have anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic stress can lead to inflammation in the body, which may contribute to anxiety symptoms. By reducing inflammation, cannabinoids might help alleviate anxiety.
Improved Sleep Quality: GAD can often lead to sleep disturbances. Cannabinoids may help improve sleep quality, which can indirectly reduce anxiety symptoms.
Then again, it’s your personal choice.",GAD
1501,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1504,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist.

1511,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD

I’ve had anxiety issues so long that I’m hard wired to stim at the first onset of anxiety or a panic attack. I catch myself doing it without realizing how long I’ve been doing it. I finger tap, I count out or spell a few colors that I can see while tapping. It’s not really noticeable or distracting. You have to really be paying attention to my hands to even notice I’m doing it. It has gotten me through some extremely stressful panic and anxiety attacks. It brings my awareness to another dimension.",GAD
1513,The reality of it if your anxiety is at a level where you need Klonopin or any benzo for that matter it's most likely that you will always need it. That's my personal experience being off and on it a few times in my life now. When I've been off of it ashwaganda helps a little bit you can get it in whole foods or other supplement stores. Beta blockers help some but only if you tend to have a higher heart rate. Mines already in the low area so can't use that. Others will say something like Benadryl helps as well but that does nothing but give me more anxiety as does certain cough medicines. If you have a good psychiatrist they will keep you in the Klonopin for as long as you need. If the side effects aren't worth it then maybe try a few other benzo's they don't all have the same side effects. Good luck on your journey.,GAD
1514,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1515,"ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY they are! But there are a few things to consinder before taking the Benzo route.
FIRSTLY: Do you believe you have an addictive personality? If so, don’t even start with the shit
SECONDLY: Are you simply aiming for instant relief? Or are you committed to making sacrifices, getting therapy and making lifestyles changes to help yourself?
THIRDLY: Will you use the medication only in emergencies and not use it as a crutch?
If you are able to responsibly use Klonopin during intense periods of anxiety, then go for your life. Always remember that it will only provide TEMPORARY RELIEF and will simply mask your symptoms.
In case you’re thinking I’m some pseudo-intellectual sprouting nonsense, I will advise you that I have used nearly every benzodiazepine known to man over the last 6 years. I speak from experience and extensive research on the subject.
I wish you all the best on your journey to wellness",GAD
1516,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1517,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

Hope this information helps!
A.a",GAD
1518,"Staying in therapy weekly long-term is crucial and asking the therapist specifically to help you learn how to fully feel your feelings when you are outside of therapy.
The reason this is important is because anxiety is a symptom of stuffing your sadness and anger. This is learned in childhood when parents don’t validate their children’s feelings or talk about unpleasant feelings.
so you need to learn to sit with the feeling, literally sit still, notice your body sensations, tell yourself how you’re feeling, and then learn to validate your own feeling. Again, talk to a therapist about this.
you should also talk to your therapist about inner child work and consider ACA 12 step program to do the grief work because you have stuck grief from your childhood as well that needs to be processed or it will continue to show up as anxiety
meditation and yoga are very powerful as well. They say if you have trouble sitting still meditating it means you should be doing it twice as much.
journaling is really good too, especially before bed if you have trouble sleeping",GAD
1519,"A 150% YES YES YES!!! DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT SO IS. YOU NEED TO BEAT THE DISORDER not the ANXIETY. Talk to your therapist or if you don’t have one GO AND FIND ONE.
You need to find your deep factors which are the cause of this horrible thing. Even if you don’t think is, THERE IS! YOU HAVE TO FIND IT.
Think about why did your first panic attack or why did you felt so uncomfortable? That is your factor.
YOU CAN BEAT IT.
I PROMISE.
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.
ANXIETY DISORDER IS 100% CURABLE.",GAD
1520,"I cured it by reading about CBT, changing my catastrophic thoughts and replacing them with more reasonable ones. I’m going to have an anxiety attack and I don’t like them but they are not life threatening. Also, I changed my behavior. I started to have a P.A. While walking my dog. My first reaction was to run home to a safe place but instead I walked a few paces further from my home & said a prayer: Dear Lord, I have had a pretty good life, if you want me to die now, then do it, I will not run, I accept your will!” When I accepted my worst fears & went into them I felt my heart slow & the panic melt away. Every time it started, I accepted my worse fear and it always stopped the attack. Fear can only come when you run and avoid, call for more, dare it to come on strong and it will leave. This is the Great Paradox!",GAD
1521,"If you do it's probably mild. It's difficult to tell just from a small paragraph online. I have GAD so I'll use my experiences as an example. I've been diagnosed with it by doctors and by a psychologist for an ADHD assessment where GAD was one of the conditions gleaned from the assessment which also looked at my general mental state.
I was in and out of the ER 3 times my freshman year of college for panic attacks because I had a bout of health anxiety. I don't necessarily qualify as a hypochondriac as I've only had isolated cases of health anxiety. Another instance was when I was 13 or 14 and I thought I had a brain tumor and I had to get an MRI done to convince myself otherwise. Just this past summer (after the craziness of freshman year) I had to wear a Holter monitor to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with my heart as I thought there was. I've had minor health problems in the past. I was born with asthma and when I was 14 I had to get an episodic type of tachycardia known as SVT corrected via a non-invasive surgical procedure. It's not just about my health though, although that is the most debilitating mentally. I worry about death and think about it more so than most people (this is a prominent thinking style in people with GAD) and I appreciate every day I'm alive because of this awareness that I'd rather not haunt my mind. I've struggled with genuine happiness since I was probably 11 or 12 and I've always been a worrier. Since I was a toddler. There's a picture of me clinging on to my dad's shirt over some water when I was about 2 or 3 years old. I've been aware of the imperfections and error-prone nature of people for a long time. Kids in elementary would piss me off every time they tried to justify something by confiding in their parents' fallaciously perceived omniscience. It's difficult when you question even the people you're supposed to trust the most. The world is so full of doubt and uncertainty.
Basically my anxiety is a product of my experiences and the fact that I have an over-active and curious mind. I'm always analyzing and questioning things and I love learning. My life is a perfect example that supports the trite saying ""Ignorance is bliss."" I simply think too much sometimes and my mind can become obsessive about certain things.
Another thing that contributes to my anxiety is the awareness that the world could be a better place and the realization of how small we are. It's quite humbling, but scary at the same time. I've been working on changing my perspective, using the basic ideas behind cognitive behavioral therapy. And I'm beginning to become happier, but it's a challenge. I have mild depression too which is probably what these realizations contribute more so to than anxiety, but they cause an internal distress.
I don't want to drag this out much longer. Basically GAD is something that is persistent across various things in one's life. Sure it does develop later in some cases, perhaps as a result of circumstance, but it's most often due to a chemical/physical nature of the brain. People with GAD are already predisposed to develop it. The symptoms typically cause some interference in your ability to function optimally in everyday life. If you think you have it you should see a psychologist to get a proper diagnosis.",GAD
1522,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
1523,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1524,"Effectively? No, but they can help. Panic disorder an GAD like in the name are disorders. Benzo is just something to help you through. Most important is Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and other therapy to get to the root cause of the problem and learn how to over come those issues and triggers with out the crutch of a Benzo. It can always be near (pocket, shelf) but eventually it is ideal to get over the challenges.
Benzo’s are great at stopping an active panic attack, and might even help at one point, but they are not the drug of choice for GAD! If it is not possible to know what sets you off, or your triggers, then the benzo wont work. Also, they are an addictive medicine and should be used with causation. They can cause sedation, and have adverse interactions with Alcohol- which could be deadly.
They are also not recommended for elderly, and defiantly you need to avoid heavy machinery and driving a car while on them.
Benzodiazepine- are under the category known as depressant drugs. These slow down the messages in the central nervous system and are usually prescribed as a short term treatment- under a common name as tranquillizers/sedatives aka “sleeping pills”.
They should never be taken with other medications in the same category and avoided in case of alcohol use.
In short, Panic disorders and GAD need to be treated with a proper regimen of CBT some medications which might be anxiolytic- anti-depressants and close follow up with a primary care physician but more likely a therapist such as a psychiatrist and a psychologist. With proper lifestyle changes and improved mindset Anxiety and panic attacks could disappear all together.",GAD
1525,"That's kind of a delicate one there.
Talking to friends, family and exercise.
People hear exercise!, and kringe (I know I do) but I also know how much better I felt after I gone to the gym or in my case to YMCA. Getting exercise especially when you're stressed or even more so if you're dealing with depression. Exercise (from any source) will work with your brain and releasing endorphins which are your bodies on supply of morphine. I say that not necessarily tongue in cheek but it's important to understand that your body has a good way of protecting itself. Whether you're lifting weights, jogging, golfing, hunting, (well if you're depressed and possibly suicidal let's leave hunting alone for now.) trust me I'm not making light of your situation quite the opposite I hope a lot of people will see this post and give their own input on things that help them through it's really important instead of everyone looking down on everyone else let's try and figure out a way we can lift people up and I know cornballs so what, all that being said I hope things work out right for you I remember a lot of times all you got to do is talk to someone you are not alone while it doesn't help you immediately and maybe it'll take you off but you'd be surprised if you can find out there simply bye opening up a little bit.",GAD
1526,"I don't have severe anxiety, but regardless I have it. I am also a recovering addict. So, my mental health providers were adamant about not giving me a benzo due to their addictive properties. I was prescribed hydroxyzine. This is TECHNICALLY considered a “hospital-strength antihistamine,” like benadryl. It doubles on top of that of being a muscle relaxer. It is proven effective with treating panic attacks and anxiety of all strengths. It is also a take as needed (PRN.) Though, because it is not a benzo, it doesn't activate as rapidly as they do. It still works quickly, but it's within a 15-30 minute window (for me.) Benzos react much faster which makes them so appealing. There are plenty of other non-narcotic anti-anxieties available today, and your mental health provider is going to be more willing to exhaust all these options before turning to a benzo. It is almost certain you will fine a non-narcotic that will work for you. Hope this helps. Toodles!",GAD
1527,"U can try: gabapentin, Lyrica, vistaril, clonodine (sp?), Buspar, supraphysiological doses of baclofen and phenibut, natural supplements like kava kava and valerian, but if those all fail you will have to find the benzodiazepines and analogues thereof. Remember , many side effects are transient but the anxiolytic effects ARE not. There can be vast differences for a person between different drugs or even of the same drug with different pharmacokinetic modifications (i.e. Xanax is terrible for my memory and word recall whereas Xanax XR works perfectly). Get past your anxiety of taking a benzo and all the horror stories around them (because I know MY anxiety kept me from the benzos' anxiolytic prowess for years and I don't want anyone else to fall into the same trap), take them and start to heal. Best of luck on ur journey to wellness and wholeness.",GAD
1528,"This is not a description of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, however, you are experiencing anxiety and any time you begin avoiding situations in order to ease your anxiety, then you are heading for GAD. It is just a matter of time.
It's helpful to look after your health, for sure, and drinking more than 3 0r 4 cups of coffee per day is not healthy, but the deeper reason for your anxiety is not physical. Anxiety is the physical result.
The deeper reason is your creativity and imagination in predicting terrible catastrophes. It is your keenly-developed skill at coming up with nasty answers to the question, ""What if...?"" It is you trying to predict every possible outcome in order to prevent any of the bad ones from happening.
There are infinite possibilities for how things can go for you. Get a strategy that is based on the firm knowledge that you can handle anything that life gives you, no matter what. Even your own death.
Ultimately, this is what living with GAD will teach you. But why not just bite the bullet and figure out the lesson now, rather than going through all that misery? Anxiety and panic, avoiding situations where you might get what you want out of life, constantly worrying about how to control the future ...this is not a fun way to live. It is based in fundamental mistrust of yourself.
Instead, start asking yourself ""What if I succeed?"" ""What if my life is meaningful and important?"" ""What if many good things happen?"" ""What if I have a great time?""",GAD
1529,"Anxiety is a natural body reaction as a protection us from danger.
GAD is when that stress reaction gets turned on and stays on chronically, rather than the usual stress reaction of see a bear, run away, get to safety, relax.
In today's world we face fewer bears, and more chronic stressors such as work, relationships, finances etc. leading to more chronic activation rather than the typical brief activation this system was designed for.",GAD
1530,"The best treatment for anxiety depends on the type of the anxiety, and on the intensity and frequency of it.
Reality or objective anxiety is the fear of something “real”, and such anxiety occurs in response to a real, external threat to the person. Usually, the cause of this anxiety is usually easily identified. For example, being confronted by an aggressor with a knife would elicit objective anxiety (fear) in most people. The most common way of reducing this anxiety is to avoid the threatening object.
Moral anxiety involves a fear of violating our own moral principles. For example, a person who suffers from chronic feelings of shame or guilt over not living up to “proper” standards, even though such standards might not be attainable, is experiencing moral anxiety. People who are self-punitive, who have low self-esteem, or who feel worthless and ashamed most of the time are most likely suffering from moral anxiety.
Neurotic anxiety is the unconscious worry that we will lose control of ourselves, resulting in punishment for inappropriate behavior. For example, a person who becomes anxious whenever she feels attracted to someone is experiencing neurotic anxiety. As another example, a man who constantly worries that he might blurt out an unacceptable thought in public is also beset by neurotic anxiety.
The subject of anxiety treatment is very comprehensive. The best way to resolve either moral or neurotic anxiety is therapeutic treatment with a qualified clinician, preferably someone educated in depth psychology or psychoanalysis.",GAD
1531,"Find a good psychiatrist and psychologist. Cognitive behavior therapy is very helpful, and if you have that many comorbid issues, medication can be a godsend. I have ADHD, cyclothymia (bipolar spectrum disorder), OCD and anxiety. A mix of Bupropion, Lamotrigine and Dexedrine has helped me a lot. Since I began medication therapy I have increased my focus and productivity by leaps and bounds. I used to spend hours daydreaming of things I wanted to do (creative and life-enriching) but never had the motivation or focus to do any of it. I’ve spent the last few years checking them off the list - learning a foreign language, vastly increasing my musical abilities, and writing the book I’ve had rattling around in my head for the last 15 years. I have much better self-esteem and self image.
I highly recommend seeking professional help. There’s absolutely no shame in it, and you will like yourself better.
peace & good luck!",GAD
1532,"Meditation. Affirmations. Go on a walk everyday. Say thank you to the universe or your creator even if you have little. Study the law of attraction. Read the Four Directions. Tell yourself what you like about yourself even if that is very little. More meditation. More affirmations. Go on a journey to discover who you are without all of your labels. Be your own friend. Tell yourself you are allowed to like and even love yourself even if you don't believe it.
Do one or all. I'm telling you any little change you make will help. You will start creating new thought patterns without even realizing it. Even if you don't believe any of it. What do you have to lose? It doesn't cost anything.
I'm speaking as someone who has hated myself my whole life. I'm finally starting not to. I'm finding who I am and I'm able to stop the voices that tell me I'm a loser and worth nothing. Its because I'm doing all these things. As soon as the voices start, I stop them and tell myself something positive. “I am worthy!!!!”
All you really have is yourself in this world. Better make the best of it and prove yourself and everyone else wrong.",GAD
1533,"First things first is ask yourself some questions. “am i depressed? And why? Am i anxious? Why?” You’ll find your triggers out and avoid them! If its a job making you sad/depressed or so anxious you can’t even focus then its time to start looking for another job.

1534,"(I think it’s a little ludicrous that there are free therapy mental health resources because of a virus since there were/are so many people who needed it long before face masks were mandatory JUST SAYING. Anyway,) There are some hotlines you can talk to, confidential always (UNLESS you are an appearing threat to yourself or others, or planning or engaging in illegal activity probably too). There are a number of numbers to call (or they have texting ones, too). If you can afford therapy, or if you have good insurance that will cover therapy, do it. Trust me- it makes a difference, I have been it for just a few years, and if you put in the honest and full effort, it helps. If you are UNABLE to do therapy or don’t have data or wifi or whatever to use your phone, reach out to a friend with email or I don’t know, these are just ideas off the top of my head. There are unfortunately a Helluva lot of people who feel alone, all over the globe, which is sad, but it’s true. If you have ABSOLUTELY nobody, and you are WILLING to accept help (bc what’s the point if you don’t try), you can call or text or email me. I am not going to put my information out for EVERYONE, but if you need ANYONE at all, and you’re low on options, Message me and I’ll give you my info. IF needed. If not, that’s cool, too. Do whatever helps you. MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS. It matters SO much. I don’t even know you, but that doesn’t stop me from saying I am proud of you, for taking that step in not only acknowledging there is a problem-many people just shove their feelings WAY deep down until they can’t hold it any longer and explode-NOT a good choice. Regardless- reaching out is an even bigger step. It’s the hard part, harder than accepting there is an issue. And you have done both, and that may seem so minute and insignificant, but trust me, it’s anything but minute and insignificant, so as of this moment, I’m proud of you, regardless of what comes next.",GAD
1535,"I wonder who diagnosed you with each of these Disorders? And who prescribed you medications for your Bipolar, at least?. Didn't they mention the importance of regular therapy for yourself?
You need to start seeing a Psychologist on a regular basis. Most if the conditions you mention are treated through Therapy. It is not a quick fix. It will take time and effort on your part. But it can help reduce or eliminate most of your symptoms.
Bipolar needs to be medicated with at least an antidepressant and a mood stabiliser. This condition is not curable, so medication will need to be life long.
Working with your Psychologist to help make some lifestyle changes to help to reduce stress and anxiety levels. This has been very helpful for me. To the point where I rarely struggle with Anxiety any more.
There are On-line Mental Health support groups, as well as face to face support groups. These offer knowledge about your conditions, best treatment options, friendship, and sometime group activities. So google search and see what you can find.",GAD
1536,"Hi, I am bipolar, have general anxiety disorder, treatment resistant, and am 62. This is so you know where I am coming from. It upsets me that you are 28 and still seem to have no direction for your life, I am shedding tears here for you here because I know what it is like to watch the years go with a mental illness and miss out on so much life! This is why I told you my age.
I will tell you something else. Quora has a blogging place here, no one can see what you write and I decided to set it up for myself because I am coming off Lamotrogine (a mood stabiliser for bipolar) and I want to monitor what goes on. It is said to be a terrible drug to wean yourself from.
So this is why your age upsets me. Last night I wrote a long. angry rant at 2am about how ANGRY I was that due to mental illness I had missed out so much on life, didn’t accomplish much in school, never had a good job, etc. I won’t go into it and make this long.
For you, PLEASE don’t wait to try and get help for yourself. Your parents most likely feel the way they feel because they don’t want to see you so unhappy. Maybe they feel helpless because they have tried all they know and you don’t feel any better. I will tell you that “Going for a walk, smelling the flowers, pull yourself together” and all the rest people say makes me want to SCREAM. And I am sure you do as well.
People who don’t know the pain, despair and utter misery of depression have no clue. They think you can just grin and bear it, get your mind off yourself, and my absolute favourite one for wanting to trash the world “there’s other people worse off than you.” I know this and you know this. We are not stupid, we have an imbalance in our brains that will not allow us to deal with other people’s problems. THIS is the body we have to live in. Until we make ourselves well, how can we look after others? I am just throwing all this out there, off the top of my head. Have you felt any of this, as you go through day after day?
I don’t know your circumstances but I do know, from what you say, that you need some help for your depression and some direction to help you out of the lifestyle that is holding you back. I get the impression that you want to change the way your life is going, to something more positive, but you need help to find the way out.
Do you have a primary care doctor? If so, make an appointment and go see him/her. You have to make a start somewhere and that is a good place to start. Your primary care will know who to refer you to for more help. Maybe you might need medication and maybe you might need a therapist to help you chart your way out of the sea of nothingness you are in right now *tears* I don’t know what state you are from, but you might be able to find a support group, someplace just to talk with peers.
Here is an AMAZING forum. They have been around a while, I am a member here (but haven’t posted in a while, but I do check back and forth.) Please check it out. Loads of resources, place to blog, a great feeling of home here:
The Depression Forums - A Depression & Mental Health Social Community Support Group
And, if you like to write, maybe just open a blog here at Quora. It helps me to write. I always kept diaries and later blogs. It helps so much to write things down.
Please promise me you will try, make a small step forward. You must get on. There is life to be lived and who knows what you are capable of doing when your mind is released from it’s prison! Take care and feel better soon.",GAD
1537,"I have to wonder, if you have never been to therapy, who diagnosed you with these conditions?

Even if you are not interested in medication, a psychiatrist or therapist can recommend coping strategies and lifestyle changes to help you feel better, and just talking with a therapist, about anything you want to discuss, can be very helpful. If you can't afford mental healthcare, there may be government assistance available. If that is not possible, you might try reading a book from your local library (or an online library) written by a mental health professional about the condition that is having the greatest negative impact on your life.

1543,"I can tell from my own mistakes what I’ve learned.
I am now 60 years old. I only found I was autistic about 18 months ago. I never married but wanted to find a life-time relationship all my life. I was in a 4 or more relationships that could have ended in marriage but most of them I ended because after years of being together, what I needed never seemed to develop in the relationships.. I’ll tell you what I’ve learned about these now that I know I’m autistic..
First - you cannot find a stable relationship until YOU are stable. I don’t mean you have all of life figured out, or you’re an expert in what to say and do in relationships.. I mean that you have to be self-confident. You have to know yourself and be comfortable being the REAL you. You have to know what you need. Know what you don’t want or cannot tolerate. You have to be able to develop a effective way of communication with this other person. I do not mean this has to be vocal/ verbal communication if this is difficult for you. Communication does not have to be exclusively vocal and can be non-verbal. Communication is a process that will come in time and develop between the two of you.. but communication IS the relationship more than just “being together”.
People are always intentionally and unintentionally projecting an image of themselves. Who we are is seen in our actions. You want this projection to always be genuine and true to who you really are!
Lets talk about being autistic. This is who you are.. it is who I am. And this is why my relationships failed - at least part of the reason. I was not being true to my self - not projecting my real self, and in the end, I did not know what I wanted, who I really was and nor did the person I was with. I was not trying to be deceptive, I really did not know I was autistic. I thought I was being true to myself but was not. Many autistic people feel they need to be what society expects of others who are not autitic. We do not and CANNOT be neurotypical.
You have to be yourself or YOU will not be happy and at peace in any relationship and nor will your mate. You must be genuine - especially being you are autistic, because this is one of our autistic traits and needs. We cannot be happy or at peace with our selves or with anyone, if we are not true to ourselves. So you need to work on not changing yourself to meet the expectations of others. A real relationship will be based on a mutual respect, appreciation and love of each other. And if either one of you changes to meet the expectation of the other, eventually you will not be able to sustain that false image. You will be disappointed and will have let down your mate by saying you are something you are not. That destabilizes the relationship.
So, develop YOUR interests, and work on social skills and communication in ways that YOU are comfortable with. Be open and honest about how autism expresses through you. If you need this or are uncomfortable with that.. let people know it is just who you are… Help them understand you.. If you are uncomfortable being your autistic self, you will project that feeling onto others. Just know that if you see confusion in their reaction of something you do, that this is an expression of not understanding.. not of rejection. Help them understand. If you are self-confident and genuine, you will attract people who are the same. These are the people you want to have in your life. And one of these people just may be the women you fall in love with. She will see the real you.. and if she loves you too, you will have found what you are looking for!
Last note - you have an advantage I did not when growing up. I did not know I was autistic. I could not be true to myself as you can. Count this as a blessing. For now you can know yourself and develop all the beautiful skills and traits you have. And you have many! Strive to be happy. Understand that, often our self-concept of being autistic is not our own. It is how we have learned to see ourselves from the reactions of others. And from being in a society that has not been established to meet our autitic needs. You will have to establish this in your own life. Do so with the confidence that you ARE an amazing person. An amazing AUTISTIC person. Yes we may not be like everyone else, but different can be an amazing quality IF you develop them. Be your best! Be proud of who you are!",GAD

It can help you address destructive behaviors, learn new skills, and find ways of tolerating distress and difficult emotions.

1546,"I am going to be very brief because otherwise I will get very wordy. Ask for details if you feel the need.
1. Do what you can not to upset your parents, if only to avoid situations that will make your depression and anxiety worse.
2. I am no professional and I don’t know you, but chances are, the depression and anxiety are secondary to the OCD – improve the OCD and those will improve, too. This means that it is really the OCD that should be your focus.
3. Ask your parents to be forgiving of the OCD symptoms, and ask them for help with those. Be explicit on how they can help. Help them understand that the problem is not the OCD behavior itself so trying to prevent you from behaving in an OCD manner is not helpful and could even be damaging. The problem is rather the psychological mechanisms that cause the OCD behavior, and they cannot help with that. They can help best by discussing it in a respectful way – talking with you in order to understand why you feel the need to do these things and how it makes you feel better, so they can make sense of it. If they can learn to live with your OCD behavior, you will feel better around them and that might help improve the depression/anxiety.
4. Ask your parents to get educated about OCD. Help them find sources for the education. If you find accounts of experiences of people who suffer from OCD and recognize yourself in those accounts, have your parents read, listen to or watch the accounts.
5. Ask your parents to join a support group for loved ones of people who suffer from OCD and join a support group for people suffering from OCD.
6. If you can afford it at all, get professional help unless you already have that.
7. Read books not on OCD, depression and anxiety specifically but on personality, personality development and basic psychology. Anything written by Abraham Maslow is pure gold and easy enough to read, so you might start with that. The Farther Reaches of Human Nature and Toward a Psychology of Being are a good start, and Motivation and Personality is great as well. The section of the library where you will find these will be full of other similar books by other authors, you can take it from there. Such readings will help you put things into perspective, better understand yourself, be more accepting of your condition, and give you ideas on what you can do to improve besides therapy and medication.
8. Most importantly, you need to have some people on your side. If your parents don’t seem to be the right people for this or don’t seem to be enough, look beyond. You don’t need many, one or two are good enough. These are people you want to be friends with, and although you can discuss your respective issues and exchange tips and tricks, the p...

I get a flash of motivation. I try to use that, but I soon realize that it’s not going to get it done. So, I go back to the step by step thing. I have anxiety and depression issues. They are not going away. I have accepted it and plod along, getting things done. With my step by step outlook, nothing can stop me. According to someone I have great respect for - I ‘get it done.’ For me, motivation is overrated, as far as getting things done is concerned. You don’t need it.

1553,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember.
I remember having separation anxiety from my mother when I was seven after I lost her in a shul. When I was eight, she was two minutes late to pick me up from school and for a very long time, I began to worry that no one would pick me up from school and I’d be stranded . This lasted for years. I can’t recall when it stopped.
When I was ten, I finally had my first major breakdown. After seeing that scene from a Matthew McConaughey movie where he gets buried alive (for humorous reasons), I was in an absolute state for a whole week. I believed that a man was going to take me out of my bedroom and bury me in our garden. After being medicated, I don’t have any other memories of breakdowns or episodes in my pre-teens.
I started to become aware that I was living with a mental illness in my teens. This was due to a new fascination with mental illnesses. In the process, I find out I had one. I began to realise this as my anxiety came back to play a large role in my life.
In my teens, my anxiety has grown much worse. In my school blazer I always have a pill in my pocket if I feel a panic attack is coming on or I’m so anxious that I can’t think straight. My anxiety has made many things harder for me than the average person. This is regarding trying new things, being socially active and facing difficult situations.
With so much information around us in regards to technology and the internet, a child who has suffered with anxiety their entire life is likely to hear the term GAD , see the symptoms and realise how compatiable they are.
My parents don’t recognise my anxiety has a mental disorder. They just see me as having very bad anxiety.

1555,"Body Dysmorphia is a mental disorder in which you worry about how you look...skin blemishes, hair thinning, breasts too small, nose too big, whatever.
These are normal looking people, some of them attractive, who are obsessively preoccupied with their perceived defects or flaws which in reality are minor or nonexistent.
This is a severe disorder with devastating consequences. It interferes with daily functioning. In severe cases sufferers will not go outdoors and consequently cannot have a job because they don't dare be seen.
The illness is underappreciated in the psychiatric community because sufferers keep the symptoms secret. It is mistaken for depression or other neurotic disorders. The malady may be viewed as frivolous by others but body dysmorphia is serious. It is an obsession which is shame based and apt to go untreated causing loneliness and isolation.
In severe cases it leads to self mutilation and suicide

1557,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

1558,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1559,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1560,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD

When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.
The following are the symptoms: (Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD))
Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t

I treat it the same way I treat my chronic pain; I acknowledge that it exists as simply the price I pay for being me, and find ways to make life worth the price, appreciating the positive experiences that I can find in living as much as possible to compensate for the pain and anxiety that is simply the cost of my existence.

I have decent looking A cups. They're fairly nicely shaped and I even like my nipples. They also feel good when touched the right way and bring me pleasure. People have always told me I could be a model. I think most people agree that I have a pretty face, pretty blue eyes, and nice hair. I'm 5'7″, 128 pounds, and would have an hour glass figure if I had another cup size or two.
But when I see women or even girls with bigger nicer breasts I feel extremely inadequate. I usually go into self loathing and full on obsession. I sometimes torture myself by actually seeking the images out. When I look in the mirror I want to cry at what I see. I don't feel feminine enough. I feel like I'm really missing something.
When I look at other women it's one of the very first things I notice. When I look at myself my lack is the first thing I see.
I wear clothes that are fitted and lower on the neck to make myself look less flat chested.
I have read endless articles about breast growth products and methods and even tried taking some.
I spend countless hours dwelling on my own lack and envying well endowed women, thinking about how what they have is preferable to what I have for the vast majority of the population.
Almost every person in my life has unwittingly hurt me with a comment they've made about breasts.
I read articles and listen to YouTube videos to try and find ways to get over it and nothing seems to help. I feel like a piece of shit for feeling this way.
I'm ashamed.
I hide my jealousy and rage as much as I can but sometimes it slips out. I am now in a relationship with a gorgeous, caring, attentive, supportive man and I am plagued by obsessive thoughts. I feel like he could never really be satisfied with me. I feel like any lover I could ever have, beside maybe someone who for some reason prefers small breasts, could really be satisfied with me. I hate the thought of him looking at other women's breasts and enjoying them, even though I know that's normal.
I feel like I'll never be good enough. Even though he is obviously very attracted to me in many ways and sexually attracted to me — when I'm having an episode I just want to hide my body. I want to protect him from having to see it and I want to protect myself from being seen.
When I see photos of myself I can't believe how flat chested I am. I am obsessed with the fact that some girls just naturally grow bigger boobs and why didn't I?
I read all about breast growth and development and try to figure out why the fuck my tits stopped growing.
And I hate myself for feeling this way. I know that in the grand scheme of life I don't have it that bad. I know it's shallow. I know I'm draining the joy out of my relationship by obsessing but it goes on and on.
Photos of women with nice breasts and cleavage selfies on social media enrage me. I had to delete my accounts to stop myself from looking for ways to hurt myself.
I have a young daughter and I am terrified that I will pass this onto her. I don't ever talk about it with or in front of her, but she's smart and I'm terrified that if I don't change she will pick up on it and take it on herself. Or possibly worse, what if I resent her and her fiends when they develop.
I recently looked at who my boyfriend was following on Instagram and saw that several years ago he followed a handful of models who all had really big fake, or at least big enough to look fake, breasts. There was no one who looks anything like me. I was so enraged to think that that's what he is sexually attracted to and knowing I'll never be that, and i just wanted to be left alone. I just literally wanted to hide and keep my poisonous thoughts and terrible feelings to myself and away from everyone. My rejection hurt him. It hurt us. He stopped following them, but I just feel like I'll always know that he prefers big tits.
Don't get me wrong, he is loving and adoring, and even dotes on me, but he has made a few seemingly very innocent comments that I run over and over in my head and take as proof that I'll never be good enough. And I know it's not him because this has happened in previous relationships. It's me.
I spend so much time preoccupied with jealousy and self loathing and really just with feelings of despair and inadequacy that I have trouble focusing on anything else. It effects my work, my sleep, and every one of my relationships.
Anything anyone says to try to make me feel better doesn't work and often times it makes me feel worse.
I have tried to accept my breasts and even embrace them. One of the benefits I guess of having small breasts is that you don't really have to wear a bra for support. I tried doing that for a while and in some ways it worked because for the first time in my life I felt like my breasts were pretty sexy. You could see the shape of them and my nipples sometimes. But I soon found out that it makes some people feel uncomfortable and that made me uncomfortable. It seems so unfair that cleavage is so normalized and pretty much everywhere you look and it's something I just don't have.
At pool parties and beaches it's very hard to enjoy myself. I feel so jealous and just start staring off thinking about how I wish I had her tits or her tits or her tits.
When I watch t.v. I constantly compare my breasts to the ones on the screen and it makes it hard to enjoy anything.
There are several reasons I don't like porn and don't like my significant other indulging in it, but one of them is definitely feeling jealous that all the tits are nicer than mine.
I feel uncomfortable when women are topless in movies and in particular watching them with a significant other makes my blood boil and again makes me want to hide.
I bought a dress and wore it out for my boyfriend's birthday. I used the best push up bra that I had and really tried to show some cleavage. I don't think he noticed. A few weeks later my sister was over and asked to borrow it. She slipped it on and there it was - beautiful, effortless, God given cleavage. My boyfriend is very faithful, but the thought of him seeing her in that dress made me feel so fucking bad. Not because he's going to ogle or stare or do anything about it. Just because I don't have it. Feeling jealous of my own sister like that feels awful. I love women and I want to empower them and I want them to feel good about themselves and I hate feeling so fucking jealous and inadequate.
I don't want surgery. I want natural, normal size, nicely shaped breasts and I just can't accept that I don't have them while so many others do. If no one else had them maybe I'd be fine. But they are everywhere and everyone loves them.

1565,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1566,"When a normal person looks at their reflection, they see themselves.
When someone with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) looks at their reflection, they cannot see themselves because they're so preoccupied obsessing over their perceived flaws.
I have a unique type of BDD where I see myself as much smaller and skinnier than I actually am. (Sometimes called Muscle dysmorphia or bigorexia, this is opposite of the more common form anorexia where a skinny person sees themselves as much larger or fatter). Regardless, the symptoms and phobias are very similar:
I spend mornings avoiding my reflection because I wake up feeling ""smaller;"" the sight of my deflated figure can ruin the rest of my day, sending me into a depressive spiral obsessing over my many defects.
I am extremely insecure about my physical appearance and am always seeking outside input to reassure myself that I'm not as ""small"" as I think I am. The extremes at which I seek validation have labeled me as a narcissistic exhibitionist by folks who don't know about my diagnosis.
I have a lot of trouble accepting compliments because I feel like people are lying to me. I'm still grappling with the concept that I'm attractive to some people because I don't feel attractive at all.
I belong to three different gyms and spend nearly half my paycheck on supplements, food, and anything that might help me escape being so skinny.
I avoid going out and socializing because I might stay up too late and if I don't get enough sleep I won't be able to recover from workouts.

I've made considerable progress in the past couple years through therapy and reinforcing positive self-image. I've had the most success with a daily self-portrait project that helps me appreciate the parts of my body I'm happy with.
Nevertheless, my coping mechanisms aren't a cure, and occasionally I'll have a BDD attack and breakdown in depression.",GAD
1567,"It is actually quite common for a subgroup of people with Narcissistic adaptations (NPD) to also have Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Body Dysmorphic Disorder involves seeing one’s appearance in an unrealistically negative way that focuses mainly on specific flaws, rather than one’s overall appearance. If you have BDD, you can be quite attractive to other people and still think that you are ugly.
The subgroup of people with NPD that are most likely to develop BDD get their narcissistic supplies mainly from their appearance—rather than from their intelligence, athletic ability, or some other factor.
Self-Esteem Depends on Appearance
This subgroup of Narcissists view how they look as their ticket to high self-esteem and high status. When they believe that they appear more attractive than everyone else, they feel secure. Conversely, when they see other people as more physically attractive, they get insecure and their underlying anxiety about whether they are “good enough” surfaces.
But why does this lead to Body Dysmorphic Disorder?
The basic underlying reasons for developing BDD are a combination of the following
These Narcissists grew up in a family that over-valued physical attractiveness.
All Narcissists rely on external validation to regulate their self-esteem.
Narcissists only recognize two possibilities: Perfect or Flawed.
Everyone has flaws.
When they notice a slight flaw, that is all they focus on.
This leads many of this subgroup to resort to multiple plastic surgery procedures to “fix” what other people might consider minor defects or even appealing physical features.
Punchline: Narcissists who depend on their physical attractiveness to support their shaky self-esteem are at risk for developing Body Dysmorphic Disorder.

1568,"Depends, if you think the 19th century isn’t new, then no it isn’t new.
Henry Morselli first seems to have coined the term body dysmorphia. Here is thing though about Morselli, he was eugenist and in favor of socalled racialism, a nowadays racist and obsolete view that has been scientifically disproven, Morselli was also a staunch supporter within the psychiatric community of Italian fascism and his reputation has suffered a lot because of that political support after the fall of Mussolini following his defeat and hanging during WW2.
It took over half a century for the term to get used and accepted in some way. Initially it was first accepted in the DSM version three and categorised in the somatoform disorders. That category name stems from Briquet, A French medical doctor, professor, and psychologist also from the 19th century, who is known to have used the term hysterics, which also suffers from a bad reputation, but is nowadays used as a naming device for histrionic personality disorder.
The low for these terms was in the seventies of the twentieth century during the zenith of the socalled anti-psychiatric movement. That movement also had a sort of backlash in the eighties which is what sort of caused acceptance of those terms.
A revisioning of BDD took place with the DSM5 in 2013. Having now been categorized in obsessive compulsive spectrum.
So bottomline the idea, term, concept if you will, isn’t new, but in its current form very new indeed. It has changed a lot. Science has come a long way to better understand it.",GAD
1569,"Anxiety disorder refers to a broad category of mental health disorders characterized by excessive and persistent feelings of fear, worry, and nervousness. It includes various specific disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and specific phobias.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a specific type of anxiety disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, such as work, health, finances, and relationships. GAD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders and can also be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue.
Here are some key differences between anxiety disorder and generalized anxiety disorder:
Scope of worry and anxiety: While anxiety disorder is a broad category that includes various specific disorders, GAD specifically refers to excessive worry and anxiety about multiple aspects of life.
2. Duration of symptoms: In order to be diagnosed with GAD, the individual must have experienced excessive worry and anxiety for at least six months.
3. Specific triggers: People with anxiety disorder may experience anxiety in response to specific triggers, such as social situations or specific objects or situations, while those with GAD may experience worry and anxiety without any specific trigger.
4. Physical symptoms: While both anxiety disorder and GAD can be accompanied by physical symptoms, such as muscle tension and restlessness, GAD is more likely to also include physical symptoms like fatigue and difficulty concentrating.
5. Impact on daily life: GAD can significantly impact an individual’s daily life, making it difficult to function and complete daily tasks, while anxiety disorder may have a more specific impact depending on the specific disorder.
6. Treatment: Both anxiety disorder and GAD can be treated with therapy and medication, but the specific treatment approach may differ depending on the individual’s symptoms and needs.

1570,"I stopped working right about the time that the DSM 5 came out, so I have not memorized the newest system for classifying all the different disorders. I did just go read the definition and diagnostic criteria fro BDD, and it does look as though they wanted to reserve this diagnosis for those who are focused irrationally on a certain part of their anatomy, not their entire body. They keep restating that in different ways, so I would say that a clinician who was sticking to the criteria would probably not give you that diagnosis.
You are giving us some clues in your question on what the issue really is, though. You state, “I hate my body,” cite, “hatred of myself,” and, “very low self-esteem.” If you have an eating disorder, the distorted body image is part of that disorder. If you have what we used to call Dysthymic Depression, or what they now call Persistent Depressive Disorder, low self esteem (and presumably the low self image) can be part of that disorder. I am not familiar enough with the DSM 5 to play guessing games with it, though!

1571,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD

The deeper reason is your creativity and imagination in predicting terrible catastrophes. It is your keenly-developed skill at coming up with nasty answers to the question, ""What if...?"" It is you trying to predict every possible outcome in order to prevent any of the bad ones from happening.
There are infinite possibilities for how things can go for you. Get a strategy that is based on the firm knowledge that you can handle anything that life gives you, no matter what. Even your own death.
Ultimately, this is what living with GAD will teach you. But why not just bite the bullet and figure out the lesson now, rather than going through all that misery? Anxiety and panic, avoiding situations where you might get what you want out of life, constantly worrying about how to control the future ...this is not a fun way to live.

1574,"If you do it's probably mild. It's difficult to tell just from a small paragraph online. I have GAD so I'll use my experiences as an example. I've been diagnosed with it by doctors and by a psychologist for an ADHD assessment where GAD was one of the conditions gleaned from the assessment which also looked at my general mental state.
I was in and out of the ER 3 times my freshman year of college for panic attacks because I had a bout of health anxiety. I don't necessarily qualify as a hypochondriac as I've only had isolated cases of health anxiety. Another instance was when I was 13 or 14 and I thought I had a brain tumor and I had to get an MRI done to convince myself otherwise. Just this past summer (after the craziness of freshman year) I had to wear a Holter monitor to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with my heart as I thought there was. I've had minor health problems in the past. I was born with asthma and when I was 14 I had to get an episodic type of tachycardia known as SVT corrected via a non-invasive surgical procedure. It's not just about my health though, although that is the most debilitating mentally. I worry about death and think about it more so than most people (this is a prominent thinking style in people with GAD) and I appreciate every day I'm alive because of this awareness that I'd rather not haunt my mind. I've struggled with genuine happiness since I was probably 11 or 12 and I've always been a worrier. Since I was a toddler. There's a picture of me clinging on to my dad's shirt over some water when I was about 2 or 3 years old. I've been aware of the imperfections and error-prone nature of people for a long time. Kids in elementary would piss me off every time they tried to justify something by confiding in their parents' fallaciously perceived omniscience. It's difficult when you question even the people you're supposed to trust the most. The world is so full of doubt and uncertainty.
Basically my anxiety is a product of my experiences and the fact that I have an over-active and curious mind. I'm always analyzing and questioning things and I love learning. My life is a perfect example that supports the trite saying ""Ignorance is bliss."" I simply think too much sometimes and my mind can become obsessive about certain things.
Another thing that contributes to my anxiety is the awareness that the world could be a better place and the realization of how small we are. It's quite humbling, but scary at the same time. I've been working on changing my perspective, using the basic ideas behind cognitive behavioral therapy. And I'm beginning to become happier, but it's a challenge. I have mild depression too which is probably what these realizations contribute more so to than anxiety, but they cause an internal distress.
I don't want to drag this out much longer. Basically GAD is something that is persistent across various things in one's life. Sure it does develop later in some cases, perhaps as a result of circumstance, but it's most often due to a chemical/physical nature of the brain. People with GAD are already predisposed to develop it. The symptoms typically cause some interference in your ability to function optimally in everyday life. If you think you have it you should see a psychologist to get a proper diagnosis.",GAD
1575,"Although this may not be a good reason it's mainly because they know benzos are highly addictive and are afraid of the potential risks involved for not only themselves but their clients. If however other means are tried first such as antidepressants ( Zoloft; Prozac etc) and or drugs like buspar ( anti anxiety) than as long as the patient is under strict supervision and sees the doctor for consults every month or bi monthly; I see no reason why benzos can't be scripted on an as needed basis. But addiction is the main concern here. There are ways benzo use can be supervised even further ( such as urinalysis and lab tests) so are there ways and means in which psychiatrists and doctors can still script these drugs ( keeping in mind the patients needs and medical history of course).
However it's very difficult to find a trusted psychiatrist nowadays who will give benzos a chance. I don't agree with this but I do understand the high addiction risk esp for former addicts. It's not unusual though for those with addiction issues and mental illness to have high anxiety. In some cases mood stabilizers are utilized effectively for anxiety ( drugs like lamtical or even other anticonvulsants like gabapentin).

Xanax in particular ( although it can happen with all benzos) can cause increasing tolerances over time. So this means the Xanax will no longer work for your anxiety at the same dose. So if you been taking Xanax for 6 months at 1mg a day; it may need to be increased to have the same effect on anxiety as it initially did. This is grounds for starting a big dependency that could turn into an addiction if not careful..
This doesn't happen to everyone however…tolerances are very individual. Obviously not everyone becomes an addict either..
But Xanax in particular is known to have issues in this regard..used as needed and or on a short term basis it may be okay in particular cases of severe panic or anxiety; PTSD etc.
Anyways this is usually why the hesitation. I won't get into whether I agree or disagree with it but I do admit that benzos are highly addictive substances and doctors should use their best judgement ( know their patients medical and psychological history) as well as determining whether the benefits to the patient may outweigh the negatives before making this decision on whether to script.

1592,"1. Political pressure
There is greater political pressure now than ever before for doctors to avoid prescribing benzodiazepines. This includes writing as few prescriptions as possible and deprescribing patients already on them. While it is fair to say benzodiazepines, like all other psychiatric drugs, are vastly overprescribed and usually mismanaged, there is little real coherence to the campaign against benzodiazepine prescribing. Patients who are justified and conscientious in their use are no more protected than patients who are not, and doctors who prescribe scrupulously are under the same pressure as doctors who operate pill mills.
2. Disproportionate awareness of drug risks.
Certain risks of benzodiazepines have become more mainstream than similar risks to other psychiatric drugs. This can make benzodiazepines appear clinically riskier, but the reality is simply that the same professionals lack an adequate understanding of the risks of the other drugs they are prescribing. Prescribing of antidepressants and antipsychotics, for instance, is skyrocketing while benzodiazepines prescriptions are decreasing. In fact, we are seeing more prescriptions of many other psychiatric drug classes than ever before in history. It isn’t because they are safer, or more effective, or more relevant.
3. Bullshit.
If psychiatrists can prescribe pretty much whatever they want and convince patients it is a good idea to take whatever they prescribe, it doesn’t really matter if it is a benzodiazepine, SSRI, or rock salt. Without objective justification or accountability, everything comes down to popularity, preference, and sanctioning. Benzodiazepines are falling out of favor, and other drugs are increasing in favor. This natural process of waxing and waning is always at work in psychiatry, and practitioners don’t lose out because there is always claimed to be a ‘better option’. What was considered a good blanket option was never up to the individual patients, like you or I, so blanket hesitation about benzodiazepines won’t be, either.",GAD

Not that Benzos caused those deaths, they did not. No, only that they were ""present"". So the state decided that in order to be prescribed Benzos, I have to be drug tested every three months.
Drug tested for opioids.
The kicker is that two years after moving here, I had to undergo carpel tunnel surgery. I was in prescribed Percocet.
That's right! There was no drug test, no hoops to jump through. That Percocet prescription was doled out like it was aspirin.
Meanwhile, seven years later, I have to pee in a cup before the state will let me have half a mil of Xanax twice a day. It wasn't the Benzos that killed the people here, it was the damned opioids!
Sorry for the rant. I'm just sick of those who truly need medications punished because of those who do not.",GAD
1594,"Klonopin in my experience. Mainly because of its much longer half life compared to other benzodiazpines. It can be scripted once a day or on an as needed basis with more ease and comfort given it's less likely to result in overdoses ( it doesn't hit as hard as a benzo like Xanax) as Klonopin takes a few hours to take full effect; whereas Xanax hits you within 30min to one hour. As you can imagine; Xanax may be better suited for more urgent situations or extreme panic attacks as you need the drug to work faster.
Klonopin however if taken on a more regular basis IS the most effective I feel in the prevention of the anxiety or panic attacks. This is also mainly because of its longer acting metabolites.
So; less risk of abuse; overdose and synergistic interactions with other medications; it plays better with others so to speak and nowadays that's important as many ppl are on more than one mental health drug. It also can serve multiple purposes; Klonopin treats myclonus; seizures; anxiety and panic attacks; insomnia and muscle spasms. Those with fibro and or chronic pain may fair better on this benzo compared to others.
Even though benzos aren't typically recommended for long term usage; if I had to pick one it would be KLonopin every day of week over a shorter acting one.
I think it's important to combine meds with therapy. A pill will not provide a magic fix. Benzos can be addictive ( all of them) but not everyone abuses them or develops a tolerance. I took Klonopin for a few years and never went above 1mg. I took it daily at first and than reduced usage to as needed basis. I keep it now only for emergencies.
As an addiction specialist this says allot. I work with ppl with addictions and dual disorders; and yes I see both lives harmed and improved simulatenously by benzos. You would think I'd be against drugs of this nature BUT I'm def not.
These drugs serve a legitimate purpose just as antidepressants do. I don't believe in promoting one particular drug over another or restricting access to a drug that someone may benefit from just because of its controlled status. Antidepressants also cause some pretty nasty WDs btw. They call this a discontinuation syndrome but really let's call it for what it is. Withdrawals.
As I said all drugs have side effects. Risks. And benefits. You must weight these for yourself and be your own advocate. as professionals we can only help you make informed decisions for YOU. I encourage everyone on my case load to do their own research and make decisions for themselves; don't just accept verbatim what you hear or read. And always consider the source.
So for me it worked and I like Klonopin for severe anxiety disorders. Especially when other treatments have failed. Combined with therapy it's often a miraculous turn around for those not helped with typical antidepressants.
I can't say whether this is true for everyone. Obviously many psychiatrists and doctors won't even prescribe them anymore for short term usage let alone long term so apparently my opinion is not a popular one.
But; this is very much a subjective case by case basis in making a determination if they should be prescribed at all. I think all doctors should also express some basic common sense and logic in their scripting habits. If someone fails multiple antidepressants for their anxiety than obviously it isn't a first line treatment that works for them and maybe a longer acting benzo should he considered ( a low dose one within reason and under monitoring of course).
A doctor will prolly only script out benzos if they feel the benefits outweight the risks in your case and that's all I can say about that.
Good luck",GAD
1595,"Some physicians are reluctant to prescribe benzodiazepines due to the misconception that they are highly addictive. While some people abuse benzodiazepines, they usually abuse other drugs . I ask about alcohol use , nicotine use and cannabis. I am less likely to prescribe a benzodiazepine if someone uses those heavily.
Another problem is the false idea that. SSRIs abs SNRIs along with other antidepressants are also anxiolytics. They are not . In some cases they can increase anxiety.
SSRIs snd SNRIs have been pushed as cure all’s . I treat intractable pain. Many if my patients are also anxious and stressed due to living in pain . It can be debilitating. Often they suffer insomnia, stress due to increased social isolation. Eli Lilly settled with the federal government for its marketing of Cymbalta as a cure all . Why it pushed Cymbalta when itvhsd made billions from Prozac and Effexor I don’t know . The drug was pushed for everything from anxiety to arthritis , and fibromyalgia. It does not relieve any pain . It might reduce some depression. But that’s questionable .
Which the Covid lockdowns have exacerbated in many people with medical conditions.
Then there are Neurontin and Lyrica . They are used to treat seizures. Both are very sedating and have been used inappropriately to treat anxiety. Along with intractable pain . I have seen far too many patients taking Lyrica and Cymbalta. They complain they feel drugged and have lost interest in most everything. Often they get referred to me when this combination causes sexual dysfunction and a relationship is damaged or ruined . Although I treat pain. I am well aware this same combination is used for anxiety.
Often the very sedating antipsychotics Seroquel, Risperdal, or Zyprexa are added to his cocktail for both pain and anxiety . The patient becomes chemically lobotomized . They are barely able to function and have gained weight , have high blood pressure and are pre diabetic. The anti addiction insanity hysteria has done a lot of damage .
The inappropriate use of medication never intended for anxiety or pain is a serious problem. That will cause a crisis . It is not if it is when .
We also push people away from psychiatrists . They want help not to be drugged and lose all interest in life , lose any desire for sexual intimacy , gain weight they cannot seem to lose with a healthy diet , exercise is difficult because they are drugged. . Whet exercise they do is not enough. The steer to socially withdraw and become more depressed and anxious. The psychiatrist adds drugs or increases the dose . Creating a vicious cycle.
There are physicians who are irrationally afraid of addiction. Though to be honest , the opioid hysteria has made many physicians very cautious prescribing certain drugs. They often inappropriately prescribe medications such as Seroquel , a SSRI / SNRI and or Lyrica or Neurontin for anxiety disorders , PTSD and intractable pain. Which causes more problems and can be very harmful.
There are physicians who care and will try their best to adequately treat you .
The opioid hysteria has scared many physicians . The PDMPs which allow government agencies to see your private medical information also scare doctors. We do not want to be investigated or worse lose our license.
It is up to all of us to demand government get out of the doctor patient relationship and let people decide for themselves what is best for them .
I am often asked why doctors won’t do X . The reason is we fear government agencies which have gestapo like power . We fear addicts suing is beside they made poor life choices . There are sleazy lawyers. Who will try litigation to enrich themselves.
Though many physicians can and will sue if it is a frivolous lawsuit , abuse of tort which is what most likely will happen. Or possibly malicious prosecution. This sounds good but litigation is very expensive. It also can ruin your life . By I have read about addicts trying to sue a physician because they are addicts. In the cases I know of . In discovery , it was found out the addict had been abusing long before they were prescribed anything.
I am very careful and also have a opioid contract . It says that all medications have side effects which will be explained. Due to government regulations. You will be subject to drug testing. I do not do pill counts as I find that harms the doctor patient relationship . Drug testing does timburi at least I can say the state requires it .
It’s interesting the ACLU fled lawsuits when states tried to drug test people on public benefits such as TNAF . Yet when patients are being treated like criminals. The ACLU is not interested . Then PDMPs and drug tests for patients were created as part of the ACA . Aka Obamacare .
If you want access to medication without government interference in your life . You have to vote , you have to start demanding government get the hell out of the doctor patient relationship . Politicians are not physicians and did. It go to medical school . ( Ok
A few did . The one I can think of agrees with me )
The problem is we have come to expect the government solve all problems and use threat of violence to force beliefs on others . Then rescue us when we make poor life choices .
If you want to be free to choose what medications you take . Others have to be free to. choose what they will or will not do. That’s what freedom is .",GAD
1596,"I have found doctors are only hesitant to write a script when I went into them and told them the one medication that works on me, and that medication is highly addictive and a controlled substance.
I (and more friends of mine) would do it with opiates, telling the doctor tramadol and NSAIDS and codeine and everything else doesn’t work. Only percocets helped with pain… and the doctor saw right through that and never wrote the prescription.
if Ativan is all that works than you probably need documentation of times you have tried other mediums for anxiety. Doctors don’t want to write narcotic prescriptions if they don’t have to anymore for a myriad of reasons.
But lastly I’ll try to offer that you may be handcuffing yourself ‘believing’ only one thing in this world will solve your problem. Mental health problems are almost NEVER solved by one medication, it’s a long plan coming from different angles. Therapy, groups, meditation, diet change (I would almost guarantee you change up your diet and you can achieve some different but helpful hormone levels on your body…. Look into it) and then medication if necessary would be a proper plan.
now if Ativan is truly the only thing that helps, you’ll get there if you’re patient AND honest. Work with your healthcare team, they want to help you not hinder you. But it’s a two way street, can’t just walk into a doctors office and demand drugs. That will never work. Good luck man. Thanks for reading hope it helps. Take care.",GAD
1597,"GAD is milder than C-PTSD in terms of the long terms consequences of their activation. The worry or anxiety in GAD, even if it were as intense as in C-PTSD, doesn’t come with the dysregulated functioning of the whole system as in C-PTSD.
In anxiety in general there is an extreme activation of the sympathetic nervous system that causes hyperarousal but there is never the sense of defeat that keeps activating the cascade of defenses for survival that causes trauma. The parasympathetic doesn’t get activated for those with GAD.
Therefore, what is clearly different between the two is the lack of hypoactivation on GAD that is so characteristic in C-PTSD and that causes dissociation, fragmentation, and shutting down. GAD doesn’t present those symptoms.
The other big difference is that GAD is an excessive worry out of nothing, while the worry for C-PTSD comes from danger. You may challenge that concept, because the anxious individual worries because s[h]e may think is in danger, but not in the way danger is perceived as in activating survival mechanisms. It actives arousal, but not the whole system.
If someone worries constantly, until it becomes a habit, the system may suffer some of the consequences of having stress hormones in the bloodstream that could mimic some of the symptoms of C-PTSD, but still, unless there is a sense of defeat, the person won’t develop trauma.
Worth to mention that GAD and PTSD are highly comorbid (2.6–30 % of GAD has also PTSD) because PTSD has the same type of hyperactivation.
In order to be diagnosed, symptoms need to be present for at least 6 months. C-PTSD still misses official criteria, so, we can’t really compare their symptoms.
The criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder is as follows:
The presence of excessive anxiety and worry about a variety of topics, events, or activities. Worry occurs more often than not for at least 6 months and is clearly excessive.
The worry is experienced as very challenging to control. The worry in both adults and children may easily shift from one topic to another.
The anxiety and worry are accompanied with at least three of the following physical or cognitive symptoms (In children, only one symptom is necessary for a diagnosis of GAD):
Edginess or restlessness
Tiring easily; more fatigued than usual
Impaired concentration or feeling as though the mind goes blank
Irritability (which may or may not be observable to others)
Increased muscle aches or soreness
Difficulty sleeping (due to trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, restlessness at night, or unsatisfying sleep)",GAD
1598,"🧩Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by uncontrollable worry, a constant sense of dread or anticipation of disaster. Persistent feelings of restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances and muscle tension are symptoms of GAD. Excessive worry about health, school, relationships or one’s future is common but often the source of worry is hard to identify. This uncontrollable worry lasts at least six months and can lead to impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Sometimes the worry can be so severe that it can lead to a panic attack.
🏋🏾‍♂️Excessive worry and anxiety that occurs more days than not about various events or activities
❤️The worry is difficult to control, that is, the person cannot stop worrying and move their minds onto other matters
🏋🏾‍♂️The worry is accompanied by other symptoms, such as restlessness, feeling easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension, sleep disturbance, and irritability
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) may occur in the aftermath of a traumatic event such as a serious accident, sexual or physical assault, or war. Individuals with PTSD often experience intense fear or stress even after the actual threat is past. They may also have intense feelings of helplessness, flashbacks or intrusive thoughts of the event, trouble sleeping or nightmares, guilt, increased arousal or a need to avoid situations associated with the trauma. These symptoms can appear weeks, months or even years after the event.
Re-experiencing (i.e., replaying) the traumatic event
Avoiding reminders related to the trauma
Negative thoughts and worry
Heightened anxiety
Increased psychological and physical reactivity
Irritable mood and possible anger outbursts
Problems with concentration
Sleep disturbance
Due to stress factor in both the cases.. The latter one erupts from a memory or an emotion /feeling state and is environment driven expecially toxic.. Brain takes a snap shot of the event and store it it then uses these images or video as a filter to scan the threats that matches with the stored data.. So the trigger is on autopiolt mode before the thinking brain or the vortex takes charge we already might have lived th❤️ough tat trauma or moved though its emotioms

1599,"First of all, PTSD is a type of anxiety disorder. If you have PTSD, being informally diagnosed with and treated for lower-case “A” anxiety is not wrong. It’s just less specific.
PTSD’s hallmark is trauma, generally serious or life-threatening trauma, and the tendency to reexperience that, specific trauma to one degree or another. Sometimes it’s flashbacks, sometimes it’s the emotions coming back in full force, but it always has to be with reference to specific, traumatic events.
One of the things I told my therapist that likely contributed to my diagnosis is that I woke up one morning, was lying in bed, and heard my father’s voice in the next room.
Immediately, I had heart palpitations, started sweating, and had trouble breathing. I was terrified.
My father’s never done anything to me. My stepfather was the source of trauma. But a male voice, and particularly a male voice that has the paternal role for me, was enough to make me panic while lying in bed.
It was a similar enough situation to make me feel exactly the same as I had as a young child, hearing my stepfather in the next room, afraid that he would come in to me next, or that I would have to face him soon.
This was a mild event. It resolved completely within a few hours. While it was ongoing, I was actively an...

1600,"I don’t know when I ever felt “normal” anxiety, but from what I’ve observed, it’s more reasonable than GAD-anxiety. A lot more.
The metaphor I like using (and I’ve seen around a lot) is that it’s like missing a step while climbing the stairs. Normal anxiety is panicking for a few seconds before you catch yourself; once your foot is on the next step, you sigh in relief and continue on, likely forgetting about it ten minutes later.
Generalized anxiety is when there is no other step and it feels like you’re falling forever, and it takes a while before you find your footing again as your brain is yelling at you that there will never be another step and you doomed yourself.
Normal anxiety is when you worry about sensible things; an exam, job interview, asking someone you like out for the very first time, things like that.
GAD is also worrying about those things, but everything is upped to 11,000. It’s slightly different for each person, but from my experience, I get nervous about tests and social groups the moment I learn about them. Everyday things that everyone goes through, I panic inside about all the ways it can go wrong. I can’t even play guessing games with my friends because I panic over nothing. The simple English class homework assignment that’s a page long? Takes me over two hours to do because I think there’s a trick question somewhere and “it can’t be this easy”.
The worst and most drastic difference between the two? Normal anxiety is temporary. GAD causes those who have it to often be on edge; I’d have trouble even staying outside on a windy, peaceful day because - true story - I’ll jump after hearing a leaf land on concrete. That wouldn’t register in a person’s mind if they didn’t have anxiety, besides maybe observing the leaf fall.
Another way to think of it is GAD is having a mental sonar radar always on. When there’s a sudden noise or something unexpected happens, there’s a red flashing “ping” on the radar. Everything in your body goes to Red Alert, and will continue until the source/reason of the suddenness is discovered and deemed harmless, then to wait until the nerves calm down from being frazzled.
I hope that all helps!",GAD
1601,"PTSD - as the name of it implies - occurs after trauma. Trauma occurs in the environment. GAD is a disorder caused by nature, a person’s genetic wiring.
PTSD doesn’t even always result in anxiety, although it sometimes does and might generally appear that way to others. PTSD changes a person’s response to stimuli, whether they’re generally considered stressful or not.
It’s the classic nature vs. nurture debate. GAD is nature; PTSD is environmental.",GAD

I have C PTSD due to 50 long years of severe emotional abuse, slander, humiliation and body shaming. I literally would be so tense that on the bus ride home from school I would throw up, more times than not. When I did get off the buses that's where the games began. I would look Her in the eyes to see who I was dealing with that day. If I was extremely lucky, I would just be found guilty of some blunder that I may or may have not been responsible for and sent to My room for the night, if she knew how much I enjoyed that punishment, I'm sure the night without any family interaction would have ended. She usually said She forgot to call Me down for dinner and would bring a peanut butter and jelly or bologna sandwich around 10pm when I'd been asleep for an hour. Like I said though that was the easiest of days. Other squints of those beady little eyes where much more malevolent. Everything from humiliating me in front of friends and family to giving My belongings away to a backhand here and there to her long fingernails digging into my skin as she drug Me to the brick fireplace to kneel forever! As I got older the physical stuff stopped I assume because She could tell it didnt really bother Me anymore. She was focused of destroying accomplishment, flirting with my boyfriend and sabotaging my sporting events especially the ones that got my name in the newspaper or heaven forbid any attention at all.
My biggest issue coming out of her home and having a family of My own, I just honestly thought I was the only person to feel her wrath and I was, it just that I allowed Her to turn My youngest son into a golden child because I hadnt known of such a thing. I did know she would do and say things to spite Me when it came to Him, but I just pushed it all down until Her golden Child was obviously becoming her flying monkey and her GC.
Not only do I have C PTSD, but after losing 6 immediate family members including my youngest son in a 5 year period and My very best friend, I collapsed, was flown to a large cardiac hospital with only 15% heart infraction rate. I had/have a condition called Takusabu that had mishapen my left ventricle to the point it couldnt get enough oxygenated blood flow going. My caridoligist explained to Me that its cause from anxiety and or taking loss very hard
When he asked me how long I've had anxiety, I thought about it for a minute and sadly told him “since I was 2 or 3 years old"". He agreed that He thought it had been a while for Me because He’d never seen such a extreme case himself. Good news though is that its curable, all you need to do is a lot of cardio and steer clear of toxic people..working pretty diligently on the CPTSD too, that and grief counseling…it gets better !!",GAD
1603,"What is Borderline Personality Disorder?
Borderline Personality Disorder is a type of personality disorder. This means it started in early childhood as an adaptation by a child with a particular temperament to a particular family environment. It is pervasive, and the person acts similarly across many situations with almost all people. It is usually accompanied by the sense of never fully being a competent adult.
The person is stably unstable.
To be diagnosed with full blown BPD, people need to lack whole object relations and object constancy. This is usually accompanied by a fear of abandonment, heightened emotional reactions, feelings of emptiness, and a desperate restlessness when not in a romantic relationship.
People with BPD tend to believe that unconditional love and nurturing is the solution to all their problems.
Whole object relations: This is the capacity to form an integrated, realistic, and relatively stable view of oneself and other people. This view simultaneously includes both liked and disliked parts.
If you do not have whole object relations, you can only see yourself and other people in an either/or fashion. Either you are all-good or you are all-bad. People with BPD lack whole object relations and object constancy.
Object constancy: This is the ability to:
Maintain positive feelings towards someone you like while you are mad at them, or frustrated and disappointed by them.
Maintain your emotional connection to someone who is not physically present. It also includes the capacity to call up their face in memory.
Splitting: This is called “splitting” because the person splits the whole person into two parts. They may view you as all-good one day, and all-bad the next. Or they may insist that whomever they like is all-good and assign everything bad to someone they are currently mad at.
What is CPTSD : This is not a personality disorder. While PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) is an accepted diagnosis for a lingering and very strong response to a traumatic incident, CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) is not yet an official diagnosis. Unlike PTSD, which may occur at any age, CPTSD often starts in childhood and involves multiple or pervasive traumas.
What are the main differences between BPD and PTSD?
CPTSD is not a personality disorder. It is a set of symptoms and fears.
People with PTSD do not necessarily lack whole object relations or object constancy.
Although many people with BPD have undergone unspeakable traumas, not all of them develop any form of PTSD.
You can have both BPD and CPTSD, but this does not make them the same disorder.
You can have CPTSD and Schizoid Personality Disorder.
Punchline: Borderline Personality Disorder is a different type of problem than CPTSD. You can have CPTSD without having a Borderline Disorder and you can have a Borderline Disorder without also having CPTSD.

1604,"Borderlines are incredibly resistant to trauma. We have smaller amygdalas, less empathy, and more rage.
We are fighters, warriors, machines.
We were born like this. We are built not for fantasy, we are an older design, built to survive.
Some say we are the last of the Neanderthals, or some kind of alien hybrid, others say we are the true God's Chosen People. Either way, we don't get traumatized — we just build up a debt of revenge.
We are not resistant to being shamed.
In Maori, this is called Utū.
Reciprocation in kind. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
We are only unhappy when the balance is deeply against us. This causes us to dysregulate and become psychopathic until we have taken our revenge.
That's why we act out - we must have “Uto” or violent revenge whether it be by destroying relationships, property, people.
Prisons are somewhere around 25% borderline -our brothers and sisters who could not hold in their rage at our humiliation any longer.
However, it is very difficult to get the right amount of revenge — to get our pound of flesh. We often go too far, and then expect revenge.
We don't get traumatized, we just get unbalanced.
We learn from our trauma — how to torture and how to soothe.
Neutrotypicals are destroyed by trauma. Their minds fill with fear, and hideous images. We don't see images as they do, we have aphantasia to protect us from too much trauma.
They get cPTSD, and they never recover. Once we are focused on survival, we dissociate from the past and become filled with zeal. The trauma disappears as if by magic.
The reason borderlines feel bad is because of the the shame debt. If we are too shamed and cannot take Uto, we cannot live. We would rather die.
Pull away from these people now. Allow the shame and rage to disappate. Soon the neurotypicals will become genuinely traumatized, and we will need to manipulate, avoid or confront them to survive.
Pull away from society and become still, borderline, we must prepare to transform, shift gears, rest in the mighty and terrible silence, the roaring quiet of Now. We are superior to them, but only if we are calm, only if we are still.
We will live, and they will die.

1606,"The others on here have given the basic answer of: One tends to be a singular catastrophic event and the other a reoccurring traumatic dynamic the person cannot escape. Nan even gave her painful true-life examples as to how she personally acquired it.
The chronic set-up is there are some categories such as kids being physically abused by the monster parent who won't let them escape. It can go to both mental and sexual abuse also.
We see it with some of the countries where children are made to work in factories with ruthless tyrants. kids watching one parent abuse another can do it. Certainly prostitution brothels for women or children create it. The wars used to be of shorter duration. They now go on for years with soldiers choosing to go back in that environment repeatedly where it both draws and repels them. Prison can do it as well as the ones set up at war-time for captured soldiers.
The shifts for us clinically come from the diagnostic codes they require us to use. A few years ago they revamped it from version four to version five. PTSD was one of the Dx’s that was shifted.
One of the larger issues for PTSD was recoding it not as an event in and of itself. People who had a single event are expected to come to grips with it after some grieving and recoup time. Resiliency is the word being used now. Normally people get over stuff with time. Most people have a level of resiliency they developed as a kid growing up through the drama of childhood.
Where it linked to some issue unresolved from childhood, that then now allows for the PTSD diagnoses. Once they connected emotionally, people tended not to get over it. The gate keepers felt therapy was able to be justified when bleak seemed to be the basic outcome because they were repeating the futility from the earlier trauma.
Now with a chronic trauma repeated and the person unable to get away from it, people often report additional problems as well as the formal PTSD symptoms. It can impact on both their personal self-concept and the way they adapt to new stressful events from them on. It can deplete any resiliency they did have. Right now we sometimes use Disorders of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified (DESNOS). All this is generally, though not necessarily, limited to insurance requirements more than treatment.
92% of individuals with Complex PTSD/DESNOS also met diagnostic criteria for PTSD so Complex PTSD was not added as a separate diagnosis classification. They also eliminated the criterion A2, “. . . response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror,” because “Emotional reactions to the traumatic event (eg, fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of criterion A as they see it.
Rather than the anxiety- or fear-based symptoms normally expected, they see the most prominent clinical characteristics as anhedonic and/or dysphoric symptoms. People display angry, aggressive symptoms, and sometimes just dissociate.” When things don't work and can't be controlled, people just pop off to la-la land.
What the gatekeeps preferred were the symptoms of depression and aggression identified in “reactive attachment disorder” (RAD), another of the stress disorders. So basically the DSM-5 has elements of the identified symptoms of complex PTSD but does not really addressed them clinically.
When chronic abuse happens in childhood, especially sexual abuse and because there is time for the mind to try and cope with what is happening to the body, we also see splitting or dissociative identity disorder (DID) which can occur. The old concept was multiple personalities. It's where the kids consciousness learns to go hide on some other place than the reality that is happening to them. Depending on the intensity, number of times, other resources able to develop and the genetic predispositions, those will determine the severity of the disorder.
For us in the field, we see elements of the disorders which arise from trauma and each clinician uses their skill and resources to recover the individual. Because this particular one tends to be a deep seated disease requiring long term treatment for recovery, many times the real root causes just aren't cleaned up. Symptoms are dealt with just enough to get the individual to the next crises.
In addition, I see some clinicians using methods which were taught in their particular schools of philosophy which are very behaviouristicly and logically based. They believe if the person goes through the motions of getting well, eventually they will get well. Where there is something to animalistic Pavlovian behaviorism, I find emotional based humans who were traumatized, very resistant to this kind of format. Many are ruined for future help. Because after all, “I went to a therapist and it didn't help.”
Another favorite making the rounds again is the 1950’s style of confessing the event repeatedly. They're required to go over it again and again until the patient “burns it out and they have no emotional attachment. This is effective but requires the person to relive the horror 100 times until they get calloused about it. It also happens to be the Scientology “clear” method for flatlining childhood trauma.
The treatment dejour is Cognative-behavioral which is marketed as “the best” right now. I'm finding most of the clinicians touting this don't seem to understand the complexity of how it is supposed to work. For them it's a mechanical checklist rather than the messy ooey-gooey emotional uncertainty these victims struggle with. Again it turns into that simplified “think yourself well.” It's Glassers work dressed up with Skinnerian overtones. Treating people from the outside in, rather than the inside out. Even AA knows it's a short lived cure.
There are a number of known process which seem to produce long term results which allow for the individual to recapture their own soul and purpose in life. They have to reformat the trauma and access their own resiliency again. It's as much a spiritual issue as a habitual one. Going to a group is almost always called for to find you aren't alone, there are people who’ve made it through, and… there are people wanting to help. Learning who and when to trust is no easy thing when it feels like God himself has betrayed you.
So the difference again is how the “stress” impacted on you along with the duration and frequency. Kids who were able to do something about it are fairly different than the ones who completely succumbed to the misery. That tends to color the way they see the world now as adults and what their own place is in at as well as how they see other humans place in it too.",GAD
1607,"Complex trauma (C-PTSD) encompasses many different types of traumatization at different times in life. BPD is most probably the consequence of a very specific type of traumatization (attachment trauma) at a very early age (from birth).
In terms of symptoms, you could say that there are some people that could meet the criteria for C-PTSD —DESNOS specifically— and BPD, because they show extremely similar symptoms.
Some scholars make the differentiation arguing that C-PTSD (as defined by DESNOS) appears to involve hypervigilance related to being harmed, whereas BPD involves extreme sensitivity to perceiving oneself as being abandoned or rejected/shamed (Ford & Courtois, 2014). I think that they made that differentiation in order to have DESNOS approved as a complex trauma diagnosis because the argument for not accepting it into the DSM is that it is almost identical to the description of BPD.
The situation is not trivial, or just a power struggle. The issue is that as long as BPD (and other personality disorders) are not treated as trauma disorders, their treatment will continue failing. The psychiatric community has for ever assumed that personality disorders are not curable. They even had a different category (Axis II) for personality disorders where insurance companies didn’t reimburse treatment because it was considered useless. That’s the unfairness of denying the trauma origin of personality disorders.
So, C-PTSD and BPD may be different in terms of one (BPD) being official and not trauma-based, while the other (C-PTD) is still not accepted as official and therefore, not having a clear definition of what it is, what entails, and what treatment is best.
Treatments are validated by research and research is validated by designing a study that follows the criteria and definitions of that disorder as a foundation for the study. Without clear definitions, research is harder and less focused.
For example, it’s harder to respond to a question like yours because there is no common consensus of what C-PTSD is. We could assume that complex trauma is what some scholars define, but then some other people can argue against it because they have a different concept of what complex trauma means and looks like.
These responses could also be helpful:
What is the relationship between CPTSD and personality disorders like BPD and NPD?
What symptoms are alike/different in BPD and CPTSD?
If you assume that we agree with what complex trauma is —the consequence of prolonged exposure to toxic stress— we could say that it could look really different to BPD or very similar, depending on the type of toxic stress the person was exposed to and if there is a failure in the attachment. An unreliable/absent/unpredictable caregiver would cause complex trauma that can end up as a BPD.
In my conceptualization of trauma and personality disorders, trauma is something that happens before personality disorders develop. The personality changes because of the alteration of perception and emotional regulation. That brings a set of problems on how the person behaves and relates to others, which then causes modifications on self-concept, on the incapacity to understand others, in the need for attention and acceptance, on the shame of not feeling that their behavior is accepted or same as others, etc. Then the personality changes and could become problematic to the point of pathology.
Therefore, the traumatization has its own set of symptoms and manifestations, that then become part of the personality presentation.",GAD
1608,"While both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Complex PTSD are both anxiety disorders, they are entirely different. Generalized Anxiety Disorder may have genetic roots and c-PTSD has roots in trauma.
Generalized Anxiety Disorder has symptoms similar to panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other types of anxiety. These symptoms include constant worry, restlessness, and trouble with concentration. Treatment may include counseling and medications, such as antidepressants.
Complex PTSD is a type of PTSD that results from long-term trauma. Complex PTSD, however, is specific to severe, repetitive trauma that typically happens in childhood - most often abuse. Complex post-traumatic stress disorder is a condition where you experience some symptoms of PTSD along with some additional symptoms, such as:
difficulty controlling your emotions
feeling very hostile or distrustful towards the world
constant feelings of emptiness or hopelessness
feeling as if you are permanently damaged or worthless
feeling as if you are completely different to other people
feeling like nobody can understand what happened to you
avoiding friendships and relationships, or finding them very difficult
often experiencing dissociative symptoms such as depersonalisation or derealisation
regular suicidal feelings.",GAD
1609,"This is not a description of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, however, you are experiencing anxiety and any time you begin avoiding situations in order to ease your anxiety, then you are heading for GAD. It is just a matter of time.
It's helpful to look after your health, for sure, and drinking more than 3 0r 4 cups of coffee per day is not healthy, but the deeper reason for your anxiety is not physical. Anxiety is the physical result.
The deeper reason is your creativity and imagination in predicting terrible catastrophes. It is your keenly-developed skill at coming up with nasty answers to the question, ""What if...?"" It is you trying to predict every possible outcome in order to prevent any of the bad ones from happening.
There are infinite possibilities for how things can go for you. Get a strategy that is based on the firm knowledge that you can handle anything that life gives you, no matter what. Even your own death.
Ultimately, this is what living with GAD will teach you. But why not just bite the bullet and figure out the lesson now, rather than going through all that misery? Anxiety and panic, avoiding situations where you might get what you want out of life, constantly worrying about how to control the future ...this is not a fun way to live. It is based in fundamental mistrust of yourself.
Instead, start asking yourself ""What if I succeed?"" ""What if my life is meaningful and important?"" ""What if many good things happen?"" ""What if I have a great time?""",GAD
1610,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1611,"Anxiety is unspecific fear of something bad happening. It expresses as relatively constant physical fight-or-flight responses, and usually leads to depression.
PTSD is feeling the same pain and trauma of a past event as if it’s still happening. It expresses as overwhelming feelings of panic or anger. When those feelings pass, there is usually a feeling of numbness, or disassociation with reality.
You should talk to your doctor about your emotional pain, and get the right treatment. You can get better…you don’t have to live like this!",GAD
1612,"If you do it's probably mild. It's difficult to tell just from a small paragraph online. I have GAD so I'll use my experiences as an example. I've been diagnosed with it by doctors and by a psychologist for an ADHD assessment where GAD was one of the conditions gleaned from the assessment which also looked at my general mental state.
I was in and out of the ER 3 times my freshman year of college for panic attacks because I had a bout of health anxiety. I don't necessarily qualify as a hypochondriac as I've only had isolated cases of health anxiety. Another instance was when I was 13 or 14 and I thought I had a brain tumor and I had to get an MRI done to convince myself otherwise. Just this past summer (after the craziness of freshman year) I had to wear a Holter monitor to make sure there wasn't anything wrong with my heart as I thought there was. I've had minor health problems in the past. I was born with asthma and when I was 14 I had to get an episodic type of tachycardia known as SVT corrected via a non-invasive surgical procedure. It's not just about my health though, although that is the most debilitating mentally. I worry about death and think about it more so than most people (this is a prominent thinking style in people with GAD) and I appreciate every day I'm alive because of this awareness that I'd rather not haunt my mind. I've struggled with genuine happiness since I was probably 11 or 12 and I've always been a worrier. Since I was a toddler. There's a picture of me clinging on to my dad's shirt over some water when I was about 2 or 3 years old. I've been aware of the imperfections and error-prone nature of people for a long time. Kids in elementary would piss me off every time they tried to justify something by confiding in their parents' fallaciously perceived omniscience. It's difficult when you question even the people you're supposed to trust the most. The world is so full of doubt and uncertainty.
Basically my anxiety is a product of my experiences and the fact that I have an over-active and curious mind. I'm always analyzing and questioning things and I love learning. My life is a perfect example that supports the trite saying ""Ignorance is bliss."" I simply think too much sometimes and my mind can become obsessive about certain things.
Another thing that contributes to my anxiety is the awareness that the world could be a better place and the realization of how small we are. It's quite humbling, but scary at the same time. I've been working on changing my perspective, using the basic ideas behind cognitive behavioral therapy. And I'm beginning to become happier, but it's a challenge. I have mild depression too which is probably what these realizations contribute more so to than anxiety, but they cause an internal distress.
I don't want to drag this out much longer. Basically GAD is something that is persistent across various things in one's life. Sure it does develop later in some cases, perhaps as a result of circumstance, but it's most often due to a chemical/physical nature of the brain. People with GAD are already predisposed to develop it. The symptoms typically cause some interference in your ability to function optimally in everyday life. If you think you have it you should see a psychologist to get a proper diagnosis.",GAD

Hello
We have a natural defence mechanism called fight or flight against any external threat to us. Whenever we are triggered of a threat, a hormone called Cortisol is released in our blood. This increases our heart beat rate and blood pressure. Diverts blood from our internal organs to our brain and limbs. Dialets our pupils and makes us more alert. In other words makes us battle ready to face the external threat.
If we are triggered frequently and then there is no external threat to react with. The Cortisol level in our blood becomes high and it gives us stress or anxiety, which after some time after the hormone is metabolised goes away. In anxiety one feels very restless, fearful, jittery, uncomfortable, negative thoughts, etc.
Now Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD is a mental health disorder. It requires professional help to overcome. It's similar to anxiety but on a 24X7 basis even without triggers.
GAD can be treated by consulting a psychiatrist for checking, diagnosis and prescription of medicines. Another way of treatment can be consulting a CBT Therapist for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, talk therapy, which is as effective as medicines.
Regular exercise and meditation, pranayama, also helps in allivieating anxiety levels along with adoption of relaxation techniques.
All the best.",GAD

Generalized anxiety disorder has anxiety attacks and possibly panic attacks and can happen without the person experiencing a traumatic event. No trauma involved at all.",GAD
1615,"Here are some specific examples from my own experiences (my PTSD comes from the sexual abuse of my father and the horrendous physical, mental, and verbal abuse by my stepfather).
If someone is angry with me and snaps at me, I completely fall to pieces. I will instantly burst into tears, I stammer and stutter, I go into full on fight or flight mode, and usually choose flight. I get anxious, depressed, and obsess about it for days. One time I was in my front yard and my neighbor lady was outside in her front yard, so we started casually chatting and I said something like “it sounded like your husband and his buddy had a great time last night, his friend brought over his new motorcycle and they were riding it up and down the street”… I had no idea that the wife had just gotten home from out of town, nor was I aware that her husband had lied to her and told her that he'd had a quiet evening the night before and no one came over. She didn't say anything she just went back inside her house. A little while later, I went out into my back yard and her husband was chatting with my husband over the back fence. I approached them and suddenly the neighbor guy angrily asked me “Why are you trying to cause me and my wife to fight by running and telling on me the minute she got home?!!!” My stomach knotted, my knees went weak, and with my heart climbing into my throat I said “wh wh what do you mean? I did did didn't mean to cause a fight"" and by the end of that sentence I was crying and shaking. I ran in the house and continued crying and shaking throughout the rest of the day, and the next day I holed up in my bedroom, hiding. I still avoid that neighbor and his wife over a year later.
I do not like being touched, especially any man who is not my husband. I am super overly particular about my personal space, and I prefer to have at least arm's length between myself and anyone that I'm talking to. Over the years my poor husband has had to learn NOT to snuggle up to me in my sleep. Apparently I have shoved him, kicked him, and even punched him, all while Asleep. And even said things like “GET OFF ME YOU PERVERT!” . Needless to say, we don't have a very good sexual relationship. I've never been able to get over the feeling that sex is perverted and shameful. Another example of this is that if I see a man with a female child, holding her hand while walking around in a store or something similar, I immediately worry that he might be sexually abusing her. I desperately want to run up and ask the child if she is truly okay.
I hope that these examples help you understand PTSD a little better.

1616,"It may be useful to start by understanding where those 2 names came from and the difficulties they have gone through to be admitted —and funded— as mental illnesses. Actually, C-PTSD (Complex PTSD) hasn’t.
PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder) appeared in the 1970s to describe the condition that the Vietnam veterans were showing when they returned. It became official in 1980 when finally, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) accepted that extreme stress caused a mental disorder.
Trauma was identified, studied, and then denied and forgotten for centuries before the DSM III (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ) accepted it.
It was denied to be a mental problem due to the political, social, and financial implications; for example, recognizing that the war caused a long-last decease meant that veterans needed treatment and that the government had to pay for it. Most of the situations that cause trauma can point out to people or organizations that could be held accountable.
The more we learn about what causes trauma, the higher the stakes are. Imagine if someone proves that racism and oppression cause trauma. Who’s going to be held accountable? How is that —the trauma caused by racism/oppression— going to be resolved or healed? How are we going to stop that traumatization to continue happening?
Even after the inception of PTSD among mental disorders, there have been barriers to the development of a full understanding of the complexity of traumatization. That has made difficult even to have a common language to name the different manifestations of trauma. How could we define the different types of trauma if doctors will tell the client that there is no diagnosis, and therefore no condition, so, no treatment (medication) and obviously, no coverage from insurance companies?
Still, let’s try to define C-PTSD even if we know it’s not an official diagnosis. According to the DSM, PTSD requires having had “Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.” Research has found that there are many other reasons why people develop similar and worse symptoms to PTSD even without exposure to a ‘terrible’ event. Dysregulation of the nervous system, which is at the root of the disorder, is a consequence of exposure to many other types of circumstances, like abuse, neglect, or any prolonged/repeated experience interpersonally challenging with an uneven power dynamic: a woman in an abusing relationship, incarceration, sexual abuse, child abuse, narcissistic parent, foster care, bullying, slavery and human trafficking, etc, etc, etc.
To summarize, PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, normally with such a shock to the system that leaves the person emotionally dysregulated for a long time. Symptoms need to last at least a month after the traumatic event to be considered PTSD.
C-PTSD is equivalent to PTSD but instead of a shocking event, the person goes through a series of events —or a persistent dangerous circumstance— that create a constant activation of the survival mechanisms because the person lacks the capacity to eliminate or scape the source of danger.

1618,"Here’s an edit to my initial response:
I may have misread the question in my first response. All the people I know who have PTSD have both depression and anxiety. But I believe it can be possible for a person who has PTSD to only have depression and not anxiety. The cause would be person specific, so I can’t common on what may cause this. In general terms, I think it depends on the type of traumatic event that happened to a person and their emotional make-up at the time the trauma happened. I could see that a person who developed PTSD as a result of the loss of a loved one. may only experience depression during the grieving process. This would make sense to me.
As far as I know, two common symptoms of PTSD are depression AND anxiety. Although not everyone who has PTSD experiences depression and/or anxiety.
Comorbid mental health disorders are highly common in trauma-exposed individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are among the most common co-occurring conditions.
When a traumatic event happens to someone, certain emotions and feelings arise. For someone with PTSD, the trauma related emotions are so strong they become stored in the body and the memory of the traumatic event is stored in the brain. If the trauma and it’s associated emotions aren’t processed, it will remain in the person’s body. It may even rewire a part of the brain that regulates stress. Unprocessed emotions and chronic stress can cause a person to develop PTSD. They will have some symptoms of PTSD. Two of these symptoms may be depression, and anxiety.",GAD

1620,"Everyone at some point in their lives has experienced bouts of uneasiness, worry and fear. It is when these feelings are constant and tend to exist over a period of time, which interferes with your everyday functioning, it classifies for an anxiety disorder.
Generalised Anxiety Disorder or GAD, is a common anxiety disorder which entails feelings of chronic worry, nervousness and tension.
As opposed to phobia, which is attached to a particular object or situation, anxiety in GAD tends to be diffused. This means that it is all pervasive and involves a general feeling of unease and worry which affects one’s functionality.
The difference between worrying and GAD is that the latter involves excessive, intrusive, disruptive and persistent worrying.
The feelings of anxiety feel uncontrollable and there is an inability to tolerate the uncertainty. It also involves an inability to relax, difficulty in sleeping, finding it hard to concentrate and some physical symptoms like problems of indigestion, feeling nauseous and headaches.
Some ways to manage these feelings include talking about ones feelings, building a strong system of support which includes friends and family and being aware of what triggers feelings of anxiety.
Learning ways to calm oneself like muscle relaxation, regulating your breathing and mind relaxation can be helpful.
It is important to remember that GAD is a form of anxiety, which qualifies for a mental illness. Getting professional help through psychotherapy can be advantageous which can help with learning about and managing ones feelings. Consider getting in touch with a psychiatrist, as medical intervention is an integral part of treatment.",GAD
1621,"I have had generalized anxiety disorder for a huge chunk of my 21 years of life, not dissipating until around mid college. I had only 1 anxiety attack in the 8 years of GAD, which occurred in high school as I was trying to sleep. I was laying in bed trying to sleep, but I was tormented by my anxiety. My anxiety became increasingly worse, as I was getting anxiety for my anxiety, of which I became aware of, which made it even worse, meaning now I was getting anxiety from my awareness of getting anxiety from anxiety, which cycled eventually into an anxiety attack, which for me consisted of a feeling of extreme mental overload, as I lay there paralyzed sweating, heart racing, and feeling like my mind was falling apart. Not exactly fun, but it only happened once, making it seem like an isolated incident. If that specific day would have gone better, then I bet that anxiety attack would have never happened, but I would still be riddled with GAD. Based off my experience alone, it seems that you can have GAD without anxiety attacks. Hope that helps.",GAD
1622,"I suffer from GAD and have done for many years. I am also a trained psychiatric nurse.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form and everyone's experience of anxiety is different. Some people thrive on it and it keeps them motivated and focussed. I used to be like this. I enjoyed having a stressful and challenging job. This was ok whilst I was in control but when changes happened where I was working I had less control and then the anxiety began to feel different.
This loss of control took over my mind and I began to believe I had no control over anything in my life and began experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks served to prove I didn't even have control over my own body. This was scary. I would be immobilized with fear. I felt like I could not breathe or move and felt horrifically sick. Everything going on around me would stimulate my anxiety more and more. Everything I could smell or hear or see would just conjure up more unhelpful thoughts compounding the way I was feeling.
When I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder I was prescribed very high doses of SSRI's and SNRI's all these did was to dampen my thoughts and feelings so feelings of anxiety couldn't spiral out of control. But they also dampened down helpful thoughts and feelings. Needless to say I was unable to experience joy or happiness and lost all motivation. I also gained 3stone in weight attempts to diet and exercise were useless. I was too tired and I believe that my insulin resistance had been affected by the tablets. The only way I managed to lose weight was through following a low carb diet.
Whilst taking tablets. As I mentioned earlier, my helpful thoughts and feelings and were also affected. I believe that this is the biggest obstacle to helping yourself to recover. If you don't experience joy or pleasure or any kind of passionate ideas then it's so hard to motivate yourself. I didn't care about my weight, I didn't care about social activities, or anything. I would have been content to lay in bed for days on end and sometimes, often, this is what I did.
After 3 years of taking these pills, I visited my GP to tell her I was depressed. Which I didn't understand as I was taking antidepressants. She wanted to switch me to another medication, something she had done before a number of times. I had to slowly come off my existing tablets before starting the new ones.
As I began to reduce my dose, I started feeling terrible. Something I'd experienced before but when reported to my GP she explains its a return of my symptoms. But this time I worked out for myself it was nothing but withdrawals from the medication. The first two to three days I went on a smaller dose I felt bad then the next four days I started to feel better. The same thing happened each week when the dose was reduced. And each week I began to feel more human again. I realized what the tablets were doing and that I could never manage my disorder whilst I was taking them. So I came off them completely and I've been medication free now for the past year.
I still experience anxiety, but I know that I'm in the best place to deal with it as I'm able to think more clearly and I can therefore help myself to get through it.
I find mostly that when I have anxiety the best approach is to simply go with it, don't try and fight it. I believe it's my body telling my mind to slow down. If you fight it, you lose every time. Meditation is the best thing you can do learning to shut off your thoughts helps tremendously.
I think some people are sensitive, they feel and think things more than other people do. They are more in tune with other people and themselves. They notice everything. I think being this kind of person predisposes you to suffering from anxiety.",GAD
1623,"Yes, in a nutshell, generalized anxiety is longer-lasting throughout and does not have as severe anxiety as someone with panic disorder throughout the day, when it is active. The person worries excessively about several things, that most people wouldn’t. This can result in body aches, not being able to sleep, and problems with concentration. Some people do have panic attacks along with generalized disorder but most do not. It can result in trouble at school or work, daily activities, and it feels miserable to have.
Panic attacks are part of anxiety disorder, just because someone has a panic attack does not mean they have panic disorder. A person with a panic attack can have one that seems to come out of nowhere or it can be a result of being exposed to something similar to which they had their last panic attack. A panic attack is supposed to last 15–20 minutes but varies per person. The person feels extreme fear and sometimes like they are going crazy or are doomed. They usually have four or more symptoms like shivering, rapid heartbeat, chest constriction, feeling like they can’t breathe, numb or tingling arms and fingers, etc. They also can have feelings of depersonalization or derealization. The feeling often feels like how one would feel if they were hiding under the bed and a murderer meant to do them harm is in the room looking for them.
Panic disorder happens because the attacks feel so terrible that people fear having them again. You did not ask for a description. On both of the disorders, medical causes and medications causing the problem have to be ruled out before a diagnosis is given.",GAD
1624,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated worry and tension, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.
Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).
The person finds it difficult to control the worry.
The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)
Again, its different from the usual anxiety disorder.

The attacks themselves feature the usual heart racing (which doesn't bother me much, you can think your way out of this one a bit), feeling of impending death, saturating sweat, extreme thirst, freezing and hot back and forth, distorted vision, crippling leg cramps etc. They usually start when I'm sleeping, and sometimes when stressors are paradoxically low.

I’ve never had a panic attack. “Anxiety attack,” is often interpreted as “panic attack,” but they’re not the same.
Panic attack vs. anxiety attack: What is the difference?
To me, anxiety occurs on a spectrum … from point A (a very low level of anxiety) to point B (a very high level.) At what point does is it considered an anxiety attack? I don’t know. It’s subjective.
But a panic attack … there is no doubt. It occurs suddenly. Point B is off the chart, outside the stratosphere.
My sister suffered panic attacks. And I’ve seen them manifest in other people. There is no confusion about this.
But an anxiety attack … example: If I’m in a car and my wife is driving. I’m messing with my phone. For some reason, she jerks the steering wheel abruptly. Maybe she approached a curve too quickly, or got distracted and was veering onto the shoulder. For whatever reason. I’m likely to jump out of my skin for fear that we’re going to crash. I guess I’d consider that a mini anxiety attack.
In more severe situations, I’ll display more extreme symptoms … shortness of breath, irritability, anger …. People notice and wonder what’s going on.

1630,"For me, it has! I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was thirteen, where I was in a particularly difficult time in my life. I did previously have some symptoms apparent in me since young like worrying over death of my loved ones; even to the point of imagining scenarios, or cried slightly differently than usual where I’d be choking on my breath more than actually sobbing, my heart rate beeping through my ribcage and my head hot. They were later recognised as panic attacks, which didn’t need a good scolding or incident to incur. My thoughts were its trigger.
I had a ton of fainting spells during this period and found difficulty in breathing most of the time. I did actually faint a couple of times. I had many, many stomach problems - indigestion, stomach flu, gastric. Those with anxiety would understand why I mention them. And seriously, there is no helping the way you humiliate yourself!
All this had gotten lesser when I least thought of them. Eventually, I became free of it. Yes, completely. It’s natural to have fears take over you, but now… now it’s not a vicious cycle. That’s the real problem for anxiety patients. Anxiety is not a parasite to be stripped off. When you study it as a solitary subject matter, it’s just as normal as anger, sadness, any other emotions. It’s only an issue when it gets out of hand; out of your control. But can you really be in control of everything?
I got out of it. It only took a change of mind. Just a different thought to thwart it all for a change. You need an outlier to cut through the pattern. It took some time, the better of my impressionable years until I was fifteen or so, where I had to live with a rather messy mindset. I haven’t had a panic attack in so long. Just annoyed and upset, and that’s perfectly fine!",GAD

1632,"I cannot confidently say that I have overcome panic attacks fully. I developed panic while I was on treatment for depression and anxiety way back in the late seventies. At that point the treatment for depression and for that matter any mental disorder was very limited . Only in the nineties it improved after the discovery of SSRIs and new benzodiazepines starting with alprazolam. SSRIs and benzodiazepines helped me to overcome depression and panic attacks for a long time . In 2017 ,the toll of taking these medications began to show up due to weight gain and water retention to mention two of the prominent side effects. I was forced to go off the medications cold turkey resulting in severe withdrawal symptoms. These included panic attacks which forced me to go to the emergency department of a hospital near my house 3 times. It took 4 years or so to get over the ill effects of stopping these medications. Thought I am feeling near normal with no signs of depression or severe anxiety, there are occasional panic attacks which I go through. I keep myself in good general health so as to get over occasional panics.Homeopathy and a balanced life help me to remain fit and cope .",GAD
1633,"Yes I had all of the above growing up in the 1970s and 1980s, I was the only child of a mother who had schizoaffective/bipolar disorder, childhood trauma was prevalent, I was raised mostly by my grandparents and dad, I never knew what normal was.
I had some success with the SSRI Paxil, been on this since 1995. However, trauma struck again when my mother was diagnosed with inoperable esophageal cancer in 2003, then my dad died also of pancreatic cancer in 2014.
Worst problems currently are depression and a plethora of eye issues like macular degeneration and cataracts. Stress and trauma have a way of killing one slowly.",GAD
1634,"At least in its earlier stages, people with generalized anxiety disorder may be able to mask, sublimate, or simply “soldier on” with the condition without displaying external manifestations of it to others. As the condition untreated progresses, however, it tends to interfere more and more with daily functioning, and so become more difficult to deny or conceal.
As my expected professional behavior was to appear calm and collected, I did so. A secretary once commended me on that, to which I responded that I was like a duck, appearing calm on the surface, but below the water level paddling like mad just to stay with things!",GAD
1635,"What have you done to try and understand it and change it?
Have you persevered with any meditation/mindfulness/breathing exercises/yoga and had any kind of therapy to uncover the driving force behind your anxiety.
Tackling anxiety needs courage and practical actions like learning about what is creating your anxiety or taking steps to learn ways to help yourself, you may even have to eventually face your fears in some form or other.
I understand that anxiety is complex and scary to deal with, some people spend a long time trying to overcome it, and sometimes find it hard to experience any real progress after years of trying. But many people do succeed even if it took them years to finally start to live again free of constant high levels of anxiety.
I hope you find what works for you.",GAD
1636,"I managed my anxiety for 8 yrs before I had to be put on medication. None of my grounding techniques were effective anymore and I was having more attacks. My suggestion is start talking to your doctor about getting on some meds, your gonna try alot before you find what works for you so don't be discouraged if it takes a bit, it will also take a bit for it to be fully effective so if your have that hard of a time daily you can also see if you can get some emergency pills to get it under control til the medication can take full effect, you should start seeing less and less attacks even if the uneasiness is still there it just takes time. It usely take 15 to 30 mins for the emergency pill to be effective but you'll feel a bit loopy. Also if any meds you are put on are ineffective after a month or two or whatever your doctor says it should take effect cause every med is different let your doctor know she that they can put you something else, you might even need a combo of meds to get full relief. Also look into seeing a therapist. They can show you alot of techniques, find what works for you and even help you find the root cause and help you work past it so you can have more control. There is no cure for anxiety it's a normal brain function that is ment to protect you but ours is malfunctioning but with the right tools you can manage it so you have little to no attacks and lead a more normal and happy life",GAD
1637,"Like the world is crashing down and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. I have GAD and MDD (major depressive disorder).
messiness makes me anxious but I’m too depressed to clean. I can’t ever relax because my surroundings are dirty.
talking to my friends makes me anxious because I’m always afraid that they’re done with me. But I’m too depressed to pull away. I always fear that I will lose everyone.
I’m a cashier, but when I shop, I have to use a self check out because I’m anxious around strangers. My prime time to shop is near closing time, but I’m anxious about time restraints and making the employees irritated that I’m messing up what they spent hours to straighten up.
I don’t sleep at night because I’m anxious. So I sleep during the day and I’m anxious about the time I have wasted sleeping.
it’s a vicious comorbidity.",GAD
1638,"People experiencing extreme anxiety often panic. They fear the slightest thing will intensify their suffering, and that spikes in their suffering will not end. They often even panic from sensible advice that will help reduce the anxiety. They are frantic to calm down, but can’t.
If the person has no significant history of anxiety and is suddenly panicking non-stop, we have to think about it differently. How long has it been going on? If it’s a few hours, it could conceivably be a very long panic attack, which I’ve heard reported but never witnessed.
Sometimes people with a history of trauma reach a point where they cannot suppress memories of the trauma any longer, and experience a dramatic meltdown that can easily last days or more. This is a brutal ordeal, but it often precedes healing.
A manic episode also has to be ruled out.
These are not all the possible explanations for what you are reporting.
A couple of things:
Behavior like this rarely happens “for no reason”
Identifying and treating the underlying reason is the way to fix the problem
Regardless of the cause, I would take this person to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Even if it’s “just GAD,” it needs to be controlled better.
Thanks for the question.",GAD
1639,"Everybody worries from time to time, but if your worrying extends to interrupt your daily life and cause debilitating anxiety, you may have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or GAD. While people with GAD may start out by worrying about simple things, this disorder can easily take over a person’s life and cause other medical problems. If you think that you have GAD, you should see your doctor immediately and talk about your various treatment options.
People with GAD worry about normal things like money, health, relationships, and jobs. It is normal to worry about these things, even on a daily basis. However, if you have GAD, you will find that this worry is constant and excessive—and in many cases, irrational. People who are diagnosed with GAD are often so distracted and consumed with worry that it is impossible to think about or do anything else. From the moment a patient awakes to the moment he or she falls asleep, worry is a part of life. Often times, the worry has no foundation.",GAD
1640,"Yes, adults can suddenly develop and kind of anxiety disorder including generalised anxiety disorder (e.g. relationships and changes in these including the wider context of work, can be involved). I worked for many years with older adults and some had long standing anxiety but others developed anxiety disorder for the first time in their lives
There are actually a multitude of factors that can influence the development of such problems so I won’t try to list them here, but e.g. with older people bereavement is one issue that can play a part.
It is important to first exclude medical problems before the sudden development of an anxiety disorder is diagnosed. In older people I worked with it was important to exclude cognitive impairment (including dementia), as loss of cognitive function leads to all kinds of additional stress and inability to cope. Cognitive impairment in old age is more common than most people realise and very dependent on overall physical health.",GAD
1641,"To have GAD is like having living a life as watching a horror movie. You are scared all the time, you fear what might occur in the next ten steps or twenty seconds, you are constantly haunted by the memories of your past, your mind simultaneously betrays and berates you in every aspect of your life. But unlike a horror movie where a paranormal entity is actually hunting you down, having GAD requires no rational reason to trigger your fears.
You will having a normal day as long as you are with someone you are close but the minute you step out of your house and into the world , the fear starts. All sorts of irrational fears will clog up your brain making your daily life miserable. You will never know when your heart is going to beat faster than usual, you will never know when you will have an anxiety attack and you will never know when a traumatic memory will pop into your head making you scream like a child.
For me especially my fears get the best of me every time, even while being alone. I tend to think too much and blow everything out of proportion. Starting from minor health scares, examinations, family issues to world crisis. I worry about everything. Having GAD has given insomnia as I am unable to sleep at night I keep on thinking about everything and when I say everything, I mean literally EVERYTHING!
Attention, embarrassment, judgments, negativity are the biggest enemies if you have GAD. Whenever you are in a crowded place, not just subways, shopping malls or fast food centers even lecture halls, meeting and weddings , you are terrified that you might get attention from the others. The moment a head turn towards you, you will officially start losing your sh*t. You will freak out. Your palms start sweating and heart will be racing. You
You are horrified that you might embarrass yourself in public or in front of a big audience. You are so terrified of that, that Embarrassment are your biggest nightmares. This is why when old embarrassing memories pop up in our kinds, we physically cringe or shriek in embarrassment. This is why every step taken is taken with fear, fear and worry of what kind of embarrassment in up ahead.
Fear of judgments pretty much rules pretty much all of your actions if you have GAD. You fear what others will think about your actions, your looks, your life. You will feel like as if somehow the thoughts of the other person (or people) present in the room is the key to your livelihood, fearing that they would have a negative remark upon you Even though they have nothing to do with you.
And the last most scariest thing of all is negativity. People with GAD are very bad at handling negativity. It can be a negative news, a negative event, a negative thought or a negative result, it can literally trigger everything you hate about GAD. Your heartbeat sky rockets, your anxiety attack slips in, the worries about future will contaminate your brain, your sleep is ruined and etc.. The stress of handling any form of negativity can make you feel like you are going crazy cause your mind is filled with thousand ways of how things can go wrong and how everything can end in the worst way possible. Having GAD is like watching a horror movie. You will be tired of running all day long , but the minute you stop to relax, the horror will strike you back.",GAD
1642,"I have both, so I'll share my experience and I hope it helps.
I worry a lot. Like, a lot. And none of it makes sense, haha. For six years I excessively worried about countless topics, to the point where I would be getting a panic attack almost every day. It affected my memory, my performance at school/work, relationships, everything. It was a living hell.
And then OCD kicked in. I started having compulsions.
It's like thousands of voices telling you what to do. But it's just your thoughts.
“If you don't wash your hands, you'll die""
“If you don't turn on and off the lights, you'll get sick""
And so on. I have to align objects perfectly in order to prevent bad things from happening. Wash my hands to remove the bacteria from them. Lock and unlock the door 4 times (4 is a good number according to my OCD haha, and 5, for example, again according to my OCD, is the number of death. My brain came up with it, I don't know why, it's a sign of ocd). I will skip the more disturbing parts.
This resulted in being late for meetings, f*cking up my relationships, changing plans because I would get panick attacks due to the obsessions and compulsions, ending up depressed.
So yeah, basically I knew I had both (before I got diagnosed) because I am 1) worrying all the time, 2) having obsessions and compulsions
If you or anyone you know have any doubts about having mental health issues, I advice you to get it checked by a psychiatrist. It lifted a huge weight off my shoulders
I hope this helped :)",GAD
1643,"I am always, ALWAYS, thinking. The inner monologue never, ever stops. Even when it’s not trying to predict the future, it’s still analyzing and re-analyzing everything in my accessible memory. I never knew this was not normal.
Uncertainty is my greatest weakness. I have quit good jobs and ruined good relationships because the certainty of ending them was less awful to me than whatever was making me feel uncertain about them (maybe something changed unexpectedly, someone wouldn’t make a promise, or a disagreement got drawn out too long).
I do not always know why I’m anxious. Anxiety can be logical, and I do know some of my triggers, but many times it seems to come out of nowhere. It can hit me in the middle of my most awesome days.
Meds are helpful, but I often (okay, usually) can’t medicate myself to be truly anxiety-free. Some meds just don’t work well enough for me personally. Some I have to limit my dose so I don’t build up too much of a tolerance or have too many side effects (like not being able to drive).
Hope that helps,

1645,"Unfortunately, they can and it is very common. You will find that the two go hand in hand in many cases. There is no reason given as to why these two illness should both be present at once, but if you think about it clearly you will see that if you are depressed it is more difficult to do anything right at all.
And if you are depressed you are feeling very unsure of yourself and that feeling affects everything else including anxiety. That feeling of being on edge the whole time, being vigilant, is very tiring and causes no end of other problems like insomnia and lack of interest in food. Cooking a meal, for example, is very exacting when you are depressed or anxious.
So, yes, they do go together and the best form of treatment is medication and therapy just like it is with most other mental illnesses.",GAD
1646,"In theory, yes. But in reality, it's rather hard to tell the difference.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is about excessive, uncontrollable worry about a variety of “normal” topics, such as health, finances, relationships, personal safety, etc. GAD sufferers may just simply worry about everything. It's basically the clinical manifestation of an intense “worry wart.”
OCD that is purely obsessional, also know as “Pure-O” OCD, is different, mainly in that obsessions are supposed to be about absurd or unrealistic fears, and sufferers usually have one main obsession, sometimes a couple of them, or at least one at a time.
Again, in reality, there is so much overlap between the idea of a realistic worry and an unrealistic obsession, that it's often hard to tell the difference.
The folk psychological terms used in mental health diagnosis are largely vague and subjective, so they are tricky. But they are consistent enough that research and treatment have honed in on some familiar patterns, enough to make a dent in problematic symptoms, at least some of the time.
In the end, GAD and Pure-O are similar in their shared perseverative, cognitive form of anxiety. But they differ in their degrees of focus and realism.
Someone could definitely have both and experience both unusual or extreme obsessions, and simultaneously worry tremendously about everyday things.",GAD
1647,"GAD:
When you feel anxious all day long for no apparent reason.. or for things that are unlikely to happen
Example: My mother has gone for shopping.. ""Oh my god, she might be run over by a car, or she might have been shot to death at the way, etc etc""
So Generalized anxiety disorder is a common anxiety disorder, which involves you worrying, being nervous and being frightened to a level where you might or might not have panic attacks.. If you have chronic panic attacks then thats called Panic Disorder..
Take it this way, even a normal person worries at time, a person with GAD might worry about the same thing.. but the worries of a GAD person is so severe that he/she might even fall physically sick because of it.

Emotional symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Constant worries running through your head
Feeling like your anxiety is uncontrollable; there is nothing you can do to stop the worrying
Intrusive thoughts about things that make you anxious; you try to avoid thinking about them, but you can’t
An inability to tolerate uncertainty; you need to know what’s going to happen in the future
A pervasive feeling of apprehension or dread
Behavioral symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Inability to relax, enjoy quiet time, or be by yourself
Difficulty concentrating or focusing on things
Putting things off because you feel overwhelmed
Avoiding situations that make you anxious
Physical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder
Feeling tense; having muscle tightness or body aches
Having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep because your mind won’t quit
Feeling edgy, restless, or jumpy
Stomach problems, nausea, diarrhea",GAD
1648,"Generally I don't really tell anyone about my anxiety disorder unless I work very closely with them, so there's not much that I get tired of saying.
I do get tired of hearing, “You just need to calm down.” or, “This is just something you need to overcome.” If it was that easy, I would have done it already. Also, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques irk me to no end. I have cognitive associations for a reason. You can't just say, “Well then, think differently.” It's not that simple. Maybe CBT works for some people, but I personally find it condescending towards people with actual chemical imbalances. Before I got clinical depression and anxiety disorders, I didn't have these dysfunctional thought processes and uncontrollable emotional reactions. It's not something you can resolve to think your way out of, especially not with a serious anxiety/panic disorder. I strongly prefer psychodynamics over CBT.",GAD
1649,"GAD. Generalised Anxiety disorder is the most common and can sub-divided further into clusters depending on what unique experiences each person has. Symptoms include; fear, irrational thoughts, hyperactivity, nervousness, tension, anger and restlessness.
SAD. Social Anxiety Disorder is becoming more common as we become much more interactive with our outside world. Fear of judgement, stress and overwhelm from trying to keep up with others, fear of rejection or failing in the eyes of others and feelings of overstimulation from outside stimuli are common symptoms.
OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is fairly common. Symptoms are associated with irrational feelings of stress, overwhelm and uncertainty. The intrusive thoughts trigger compulsions that are carried out to temporarily relive the anxiety.
Phobias. Although this ties in with most other forms of anxiety, it can be a separate illness. Irrational fears, that are triggered by uncertainty and are a means of avoiding the unwanted feelings associated, are common symptoms.
Panic Disorder. An increased state of fight or flight response triggered by an irrational stress response that increases fear, sending the nervous system into overdrive, continously living on edge, being easily startled and suffering from frequent panic attacks. It may often cause paranoia to occur.
6. PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder is a fear based illness that causes irrational anxiety and worry to occur based on previous trauma. The brain enters defensive mode and tries to protect itself from future threat by fearing the past. Symptoms include flashbacks, panic, anxiety, stress, worry, more fear and and an insistance on avoidance.
It is important to note that an anxiety disorder is caused by one's perceptive response to an environment and suppression of one's natural anxious tendencies, that lead to elevated stress levels - which further intensify the anxiety to an irrational and destabilising level.",GAD
1650,"Mental health workers usually don’t use the word cure when we talk about the problems that bring people to therapy. That’s mostly because therapy isn’t exactly about completely getting rid of a disease. Instead, therapy is about learning how to change what can be changed and to live with stuff that we can’t change. When therapy works a person gets better, sometimes we say they are in remission, but we probably don’t say they are cured. If you go back to that same therapist when you are in remission from your old problem, they might have your old diagnosis on file still, and they might pay a little bit of attention to your old problem to make sure it doesn’t become a new problem. But mostly they will focus on the new problem that brought you back. If you try out a new therapist who doesn’t know about your experience with GAD, they might not give you that diagnosis.
Most of the time when a person with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) gets better, it’s not because their anxiety went away. It is because they learned new actions that stop their anxiety from getting in the way. The emotion (anxiety) still happens, and for some people it still happens just as often as it did before therapy. But after therapy they that emotion isn’t a problem anymore.
Even though we don’t say that we cure GAD, there are definitely people who go into full remission (their GAD symptoms cause no problems for them) and stay that way for the rest of their life.
So some of this is semantics (cure vs. remission, though important semantics), and it is possible for a person with GAD to get better and stay well.",GAD
1651,"Well a specific phobia is easily the most different of the three. It's a pervasive sense of fear, anxiety, or disgust causing someone to NEED to avoid such a thing. For instance, I have trypophobia (fear of many holes, tiny holes) and claustrophobia (fear of dark enclosed spaces.)
My trypophobia makes me have to look away, feel incredibly nauseous, and almost start crying just by seeing them. It feels as though my skin is crawling. It isn't always just holes, it can be circles such as this beach texture in Pokemon Legends Arceus that makes me feel icky or the way wasps nests look. I love Steven Universe, but seeing the kindergartens (which are where gems break out through the earth in a mass production thing so lots of holes) made me want to cry and I could NOT look at the screen. My claustrophobia is a bit different as it's mostly enclosed or tiny spaces. I feel trapped and terrified and may have a panic attack. I get that way in cars as well. The dark does make it worse (I also have a fear of the dark), but just the thought makes me feel like I could die. It's intense fear/anxiety/disgust at these specific things. It can be so genuinely upsetting for people. For instance, I think it was some trashy show, but they brought in a woman who was afraid of olives and promised her they wouldn't show her then then they brought out olives anyway. The reason she feared them was because it reminded her of the eyes of a corpse of a family member. It was a traumatic experience and a trigger for her. Phobias can be brought about by traumatic experiences which can be small or minor things as well. I can't say for sure where my phobias come from, but they can't be helped either way. So phobias typically have a specific trigger.
While GAD and SAD can have triggers, they are typically scenarios, different, etc. Phobias always have the same trigger with it being something that resembles the phobia (for instance, it may not be the exact same object or thing, but it's similar enough that the brain thinks of it like that.) While GAD and SAD have far more broad triggers. For instance, my GAD is triggered by a lot of scenarios involving people as well as my trauma. It plays into how I react and worsens my PDs. But it isn't strictly social scenarios, it can be anything where it feels as though something will go wrong.
SAD is socially based entirely. Thoughts of social interactions, being out in public, feeling constantly scrutinized, wondering if people are watching or looking at you, wondering if you sound normal just to name a few. My GAD affects me socially, but it is GENERALIZED anxiety in which case it is far more broad. GAD for others can include something bad happening to people, feeling like it's the end of the world over small things, fearing an actual end of the world, anxiety constantly where it's just like everything feels like it'll go wrong and pervasive thoughts of “what if this happens or that happens?” SAD is pervasive anxiety in social situations, whether it's online, over text, in person, just being in public, on call, etc. Both disorders are pervasive and regular experienced, aka chronic even when they aren't actively in a scenario. While phobias are often not constant and only when a person is around the specific thing they fear or something that resembles it. For instance, someone fearing wide open spaces may encounter it more so they'll be more triggered than something like a phobia of cats where they can often be avoided. Or olives can typically be avoided and while thunderstorms may not always be avoidable since weather is unpredictable so if you're in a place with such weather patterns, you can't exactly avoid it.",GAD
0,"I wanted to share my experience and possibly get some advice. Ever since I was little, I remeber having spells of intense fear and panic for no reason that would last for days at a time. I would get this feeling in the pit of my stomach and then my body would get hot and I would know that I was going through it again. Fast foward to my late teen years, I got put on Sertraline, which seemed to help a lot with the racing thoughts and overall feeling of panic and dread. Occasionally I would still get this feeling, but it would go away within a couple hours or maybe a day at most. After about 5 years on Sertraline (getting it from the same pharmacy) my family changed our prescriptions to come from an online pharmacy. Now, I’m not sure if this is why I’m spiraling and having these intense feelings of fear and distress, but I think the addatives in the pill may be different and that is why I’m going thought this right now. I’ll be at work, with heart palpitations, a tight chest and shoulders, sweating, and an intense feeling of fear and depression for no reason. It’s like my body is in a constant state of fight or flight and I can’t seem to escape it. 

I guess my point of this post is to ask if anyone else can relate to these random feelings of fear and eeriness. Sertraline really seemed to help me this last few years, so I’m hoping switching back to my original pharmacist will help elevate this distress. I’m trying so hard to stay strong, but this is hell. I am home in my bed, but for some reason I’m scared and afraid.. doesn’t help I live in the middle of the woods lmao. 

For those who experience these intense feelings, are there any medications that have reduced your panic and anxiety? Are benzos something to look into? I read that the long-lasting benzos such as clonazepam and Valium may be a good fit for GAD. Might be good to mention I also definitely have OCD… though never officially diagnosed. I fear my OCD leads to GAD and therefore leads to DPDR. Good lord I wish I had a different brain! 🧠 Thanks for reading.",GAD
1,"TW: mention of self harm. 

i’ve been having a rough 3 weeks with my anxiety. for some background, i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at a young age. when i was in high school i was prescribed lexapro by a doctor who worked in the adolescent medicine department of the children’s hospital near me (on the hospital website it stated that she specializes in anxiety disorders and more). i was on lexapro for 3 years. those 3 years had to have been the darkest and hardest years of my life. i felt like a total zombie, struggled heavy with depression, terrible mood swings, my insomnia was at its worst, and i even developed suicidal thoughts which led me to hurt myself. throughout the time i was seeing this doctor, i would literally tell her the honest truth about what i was dealing with & she never took me off of the medication & just kept prescribing higher dosages. when i graduated high school and moved to college, i decided to stop taking the lexapro cold turkey & man when i tell yall i had never felt that amazing in my entire life. since then i would have my moments. i’d deal with my occasional panic attacks, when triggered, but it wasn’t until last fall (september 2023) where i started to have random anxiety attacks. it wasn’t severe, at first it was rough and i decided to go home for a few weeks but then i felt better and moved on. now fast forward to now. early december of this past year, i started to feel HEAVY feelings of anxiety, so heavy they felt as horrible as they did when i was first diagnosed (back then my anxiety was extremely severe). i ignored the feelings, but it wasn’t until 3 weeks ago on sunday january 12th where i just exploded. since then ive been having random anxiety attacks throughout the day, im not eating, and im not sleeping at night bc ill be up having anxiety attacks or my mind just won’t let me sleep. it’s been so bad that i haven’t been able to go to work. i moved back home this past school year so my mom has been helping me through this and we found me a new psychiatrist. i had my appointment today and she brought up the option of taking medication to try and help me. she mentioned how Sertraline is her favorite medication to prescribe her patients bc for the most part all of her patients have reacted very well & said it was a game changer. she also mentioned how she didn’t agree with how my last doctor approached my situation with the lexapro (which made me feel like maybe i could trust her), but after that experience i am extremely terrified to even try medication again….i did some research and even searched up videos on tiktok bc i rather hear about peoples experiences since i think that means more than research. so if anyone has been diagnosed with GAD and takes Sertraline (without any other medications), pls let me know what your experience has been like!! i really want to get better, im starting therapy next week first & i’ll go from there.

2,"Mine is not thinking too much of xyz which are bothering me. I learned it after years of exhausting overthinking coupled with suffocating anxiety.

Also when in immigration I had to make living for myself because I was alone in the country, I was doing things which were difficult for me both socially and psychologically. 

One example- I had one housemate at one point and she never was seen outside her room as there was a toilet and shower in it. Her boyfriend told me that she has social anxiety and she is gutted when she has to come out.
And I thought to myself wow that’s where I should be at but instead of it I am a delivery person with lots of socialising. Because I don’t have a boyfriend paying for my room, food etc.. Then I was recreation assistant and again with large people flow. I hated my days on the job but I was still doing it because I needed money.

Another example- oh how I hated school- I was too sensitive and even getting headaches from the noise levels during breaks. But homeschooling wasn’t and option, I haven’t thought about such option until covid lockdowns.

One more example- I have suffocating sensation from my anxiety. But I applied for the job during Covid and I worked in a mask, which also made my glasses foggy. As much as it was bothering me I kept working there because that was the plan. I would stop in my ways and grab the bread shelves I was loading, people walking around me, and I was gasping for air trying to make an inhale, sometimes for the duration of couple of minutes, and no one cared. So didn’t I. But those were low-key panic attacks.

So it was horrible to live through such daunting conditions for me, I developed burnout and went into major depressive episode after few years like so, but now I know I am capable to adapt and live however will be required…


And when something is bothering me, I pretent to myself that I sort of don’t have this problem.
I treat my struggles as a game and brush them off. Not escaping though- I acknowledge that I have it and kind of playfully challenge myself, asking, so what? 

(Of course it isn’t foolproof and doesn’t work during full-on depressive episode).",GAD

I was prescribed Fluoxetine 20 mg BID and  Buspirone 5 mg AS NEEDED in 2023 by a Nurse Practitioner at a regular physical exam that I had mentioned my worsening anxiety and suicidal ideations.  I had previously been prescribed Fluoxetine 30 mg BID and Alprazolam 0.5 BID OR as needed, which worked for a while, was presribed by my last psychiatrist but had lost insurance coverage and could no longer see her.

10,"So I only joined and started contributing to Reddit recently, if anyone looks up my profile, you can see I mostly posted in cUTI and anxiety topics. I have the worst health anxiety and GAD so I've obviously always been googling everything before Reddit as well. And while there are tons of useful tips and shared experiences I can find here, I also noticed that reading about other people's stories sometimes creates even worse scenarios in my head. If a comment is not reassuring, my anxiety spikes again. After all, we have no clue who's posting and saying what, all our experiences can be vastly different.
So I'm kind of thinking about deleting this app because I tend to check it out now every time my phone's in my hand, like when I mindlessly scroll social media (probably should delete those apps too). And I can genuinely feel that's not great for my mental health.

11,"hi, i was diagnosed with GAD when i was 8 years old, im now 20 and currently feeling the same way i would feel when my anxiety was at it’s prime all because i’m seeing scary things on the news & social media. when i was first diagnosed my therapist would tell me parents to try to avoid me from watching the news and certain movies/tv shows of natural disasters or anything that can set me off, so this isn’t new, but i thought that i may have already moved passed that trigger. as i grew up, i learned to just not let outer events affect me and to just chill, but for the past few weeks it’s felt like i’m 8 years old again dealing with the scariest and worst feelings of anxiety. 

today it got pretty bad, for i had to leave my long distance boyfriend to come back home after visiting him for 2 weeks and all i could think about was the fear of it possibly being our last goodbye all bc lately my social media has been flooded with passings of loved ones, natural disasters, talk of war, etc. i stopped going to therapy in high school because i just never found the right therapist, and it’s just so expensive. i’m not on any medications anymore either, i was on lexapro for around 3 yrs & it turned me into a total depressed suicidal zombie. 

i guess im just looking for reassurance that this isn’t just something that happens to me and i guess tips on how to try to move past this? i’m a 20 yr old college student who’s also in a sorority studying marketing soooo deleting social media isn’t rlly an option. i’ve tried blocking countless news accounts on all of my socials, yet i keep finding these terrible things. it also doesn’t help that it’s most of these topics are normal conversation at the moment. :,) ",GAD

14,"Hi everyone, my name is Anna.

I am currently working with a team of scientists who have developed a new lithium salt — lithium ascorbate. Our research shows that it has the potential to become an alternative to currently used compounds, as it demonstrates significant effectiveness with lower toxicity.

Lithium is widely known as a first-choice treatment for mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression. This has created an image of lithium as a ""last resort"" for severe cases.

However, lithium is an essential element for the normal functioning of all body systems and, most importantly, the brain. The human body requires 0.7 mg of lithium per day for proper functioning. Without it, the risk of various mental health conditions increases. 

The findings of our research have been published in an article in the journal *Molecules*. Below is a brief summary, and you can read the full text via this [link](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2253).

What did we find out?

* Lithium ascorbate prevents the reabsorption of dopamine and serotonin (the happy hormones) by neurons, which helps increase their levels and prolong their action, resulting in a stable good mood;
* Lithium ascorbate increases cell survival under conditions of glutamate stress. It enhances the regenerative capacity and formation of new connections among neurons within the central nervous system; 
* Lithium ascorbate prevents glutamate stress, which leads to anxiety disorders;
* Lithium ascorbate is characterized by low acute and chronic toxicity; it is safe even when used in high doses.

According to the article, we can conclude that lithium ascorbate is a safer substance to support our mental health, with the same or even better effects than commonly used lithium carbonate.

If you're curious about how lithium ascorbate could revolutionize mental health support or have questions about its potential benefits, let's start a conversation! What are your thoughts on this next-gen lithium salt?

18,"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing relatively well. I am the moderator here and I'd like to share a couple of the best solutions I have found to (potentially) overcoming the bulk of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

My philosophy is that often a large chunk of the GAD is caused by limiting beliefs. Eliminating the limiting beliefs could potentially wipe out the entire disorder.

Here are the best (free) ways I know how to do this:

1. Faster EFT
2. Lefkoe Method

(There are other ways but you need to hire a practitioner for them. Actually, it's best you hire one for the methods above also, especially if you have big painful memories inside you that you just want to run away from. I am not trained in the above methods, I just believe in them and found them personally transformative. You can, of course, learn to do these yourself for free, read on if this resonates).

Faster EFT operates under the assumption that beliefs come from memories. If you dismantle your unwanted memories, your limiting beliefs vanish also. (Because they came from the memories). An example: someone unexpectedly beat you as a child (this happened to the founder of this method) you change the memory and no longer feel anxiety around people that remind you of that person. If you want to find out more about this method, Robert the founder has over 1000 videos on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SkillsToChange) showing how to do it, testimonials, troubleshooting tips etc.

The Lefkoe Method (TLM) is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety (for public speaking). It went down from 7/10 to 1.5/10 on average over a handful of sessions (if I recall correctly). TLM focuses on beliefs. Say you feel unworthy, then you may have a limiting belief of ""I'm unworthy"". You go through the one of the processes and realise you never saw evidence of that objectively because the world is 100% neutral at all times. The belief vanishes and you feel lighter immediately. If you want to find out more about this method, go to the r/TheLefkoeMethod sub, there is a pinned post where you can try it immediately. This one I found it quite hard to do, but well worth the time to get the hang of it.

Both of these methods are very powerful and you can do it for free! Profound results not unheard of, such as eliminating trauma from seeing someone killed to being unable to feel bad about it 10 minutes later. Check them out!",GAD

Slight vitamin d deficiency, abnormal high iron in the 300s, thyroid is always normal. Thank god. I try to think of other things that could cause these symptoms to check in the new year when I finally have medical insurance. (Lost my job, well left my 14 year court clerk job back in June after the new supervisors wanted to demote me from my high rank I took so long and worked so hard to get to because I wasn’t “dependable” anymore without saying but because of my anxiety and panic attacks, they didn’t like that I had to run outside because I would hyperventilate a lot, but I still came into work every day and did my job. This is after she told me to go outside if I needed to 🤦🏻‍♀️ so she took it back. So much worse was going on in that office but they wanted to make an example out of me. The way I was treated because I’m too quiet to stick up for myself. I can not even begin to tell you all I did for that office, not to toot my own horn but I was a damn hard worker who genuinely cared about my job, my accuracy, I was so proud of my job. I trained and mentored so many new hires over the years that they asked me to, did every task I was asked, the job of 3 for a period of time, I left with close to a $3,000 check of unused vacation hours paid out, I’d make it a point to come into work and show that I wanted to be there whether I left early or came in late for appts. They knew I had anxiety and panic all of these years, why they chose to wanna demote me now even though my work was always done I have no idea, but I left on my own. It was a slap in the face to me and I was not going to be embarrassed. I had too much pride. Started a job as a high school receptionist shortly after had more panic attacks when the kids came back to school I couldn’t handle the busyness) idk what to do anymore. I don’t work yet because I get physically sick form just going to the store and driving. If I’m medicated and take my xan* I do ok. But I can’t pop one every time I want to try to leave the house. I’d love to do that but my dr already said he won’t prescribe long term. He won’t even up my dose a little more than 0.25 twice a day. Instead He gave me klon 0.50 to try. But I haven’t yet. I feel since he’ll eventually get me off of them there’s no point in seeing if it’ll help. A few days ago, I took my 10mg propranolol, 4mg zofran, and 0.50 xan along with my daily med of busprione just to make it through my mammogram appt that was 25 mins away. When it all kicks in I wish I felt that normal all of the time. I can eat, drive, and go into a restaurant, not sure about a store. I’m at 60mg buspirone for a month and a half now. I’ve been on this med since 2019 and it helped tremendously up until this year. I was never at 60 back then. Just got to that November 10. He’s added Prozac 10mg. I’ve been nervous to start. Even more that the pharmacist when counseling on it said she loves it for weight control, and depression but made a scrunchy face and said it may not be good for a person with anxiety as it’s known to make a person more nervous. Great! Just venting guys. I know what I need to do. Quit hoping for a miracle that my buspirone increase will finally help like it had been. Quit hoping my Dr will slightly increase my Benzo. And just quit hoping for a miracle. And start an ssri for the first time. My sleep isn’t great, i stay hydrated, but I don’t eat well because anxiety tenses me up so much I feel like I can’t even swallow properly. Sometimes I’m starving sometimes I have no appetite. But this has been such a depressing year depressed because of the anxiety and panic. I don’t even know what triggered the anxiety and panic to come back in April the way it did. So harsh. This is how I felt in 2019 when it first hit me. Maybe work was my trigger. My nephew came to live with me, it had been always been a quiet house just me and my pops. His toddler visits on the weekend. He’s a lot to handle that munchkin. Maybe the no more quiet time I was used to? That was when I was working and weekends were my only me time. But I was focused on helping with the toddler. I noticed my anxiety didn’t happen until 6 years after my mom’s death in 2019 she passed in 2013 and now a year after my sister in laws death who passed in 2023. Maybe now since im the only girl left in my immediate family im expected to be the go to. Idk about other families but ive noticed the daughters or the sisters are the go tos.

39,"Hello fellow GAD ""enjoyers""!

My anxiety has flared up in the recent weeks, and thus read a lot about the condition just to understand it better. That's when I came across a company called Mind Medicine who is developing an LSD-based drug to tackle GAD. They have successfully passed the FDA's Phase 2 trial. Phase 3 trial should have started by now.

Oddly/interestingly, no new drug for GAD has been developed in the last 20 years or so, though there are at least 20M adults living with GAD in the US only (as per MM's website). I also read it somewhere that anxiety has rapidly increased in the population in the last couple of decades, so maybe there is a connection: it is now even more profitable to come up with a new drug.

I'd also recommend Dr. Gabor Mate's book of The Myth of Normal. Mate is describing how off our modern society is vs what thousands of years of evolution is wired into our brains. A good example he gives is of a Venezuelan tribe, living in the rainforest: their newborns are constantly wrapped around their mother's, and they won't touch the ground for 2 years. Their mothers smell, touch of skin, heartbeat is constantly there - 24/7. Plus the whole tribe is also present, from young to old. No kindergarten at the age of 6-month, no mother going to their 9to5. I don't say we should go back to prehistoric conditions. All I'm saying is no surprise mental illnesses are on the rise when we are so far off what nature intended for us.

I'm currently switching from Vortioxetine (Trintellix/Brintellix) to Paroxetine (Paxil/Rexetin) as Vortioxetine is just a mood-enhancer, only slightly easing anxiety symptoms.

44,"Hi everyone, I'm 28 and have been dealing with persistent, severe anxiety symptoms since childhood. I've been diagnosed with GAD, panic disorder, OCD, agoraphobia, and somatization disorder. My anxiety is marked by recurring physical symptoms like dizziness, near-fainting, tachycardia, sweating, nausea, and brain fog. These symptoms cycle weekly and are accompanied by intrusive thoughts and hyper-vigilance that make daily life a challenge.

I've tried a wide range of treatments, including SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and other meds, but most either didn’t help or worsened my symptoms. Benzodiazepines provide some relief for panic attacks but not for generalized anxiety or OCD. I’ve also explored alternative medications like Clonidine and Lyrica without success. My symptoms are present 24/7 and i never get a break ever. When my condition flares up during the day it becomes so bad that i am not even aware im having anxiety, i just feel delusionally sick physically and mentally.

I’ve spent years undergoing medical tests (MRIs, blood work, specialist visits) to rule out physical causes, but no definitive answers have emerged. My psychiatrist suspects underlying bipolar traits, and I’m being referred to a specialist for further evaluation.

51,"I want to hear from people who have this diagnosis. What does it feel like to you. How did it start, and how long has it lasted. What does your day look like.. I’m scared

I’ll explain my situation if anyone wants to read. I had panic disorder when I was a teenager. Then two years ago I had this horrifying anxiety attack that lasted 11 days, and it completely changed my life for the worse. But I’ve never had “normal” anxiety. I mean as in the daily anxiety feeling that lingers. I’ve only ever had it as an extreme anxiety or panic attack, and then when it’s over, the anxiety slowly calms down over the course of about a month. But two months ago I started having “normal” anxiety. I it started as a day long anxiety attack, and then it calmed down. Or so I thought, cause 2 months later I’m still anxious and I’m so confused and scared. I’ve had my blood work done to check if there’s anything wrong. I had low b-12 levels, and also folate deficiency which can cause anxiety, but after a few weeks of supplementing the anxiety is still here and it’s scaring me to think that this may never pass. I’m not used to this. I had a panic attack a few days ago, the first since I was a teenager, and I’m so so so so fucking scared. (I categorize anxiety attacks and panic attacks as two different things. Anxiety attacks feels like panic attacks, but lasts multiple days. Panic attacks lasts a couple of hours) I’ve always said that I’d sacrifice every limb of my body if it meant I’d never experience anxiety again. I’d rather be chronically physically ill forever than live with anxiety. And now I’m anxious every day. I’m so scared that I’ve developed generalized anxiety disorder. I can’t live like this. My psychologist says I have to accept the anxiety for it to get better, but I’m not capable of sitting in it. It’s the worst feeling I’ve ever had.

58,"Hi there! I’m looking for advice or to know your experiences with procrastinating because of being so overwhelmed with having a noisy head while trying to work on anything. People often say: don’t think just do it/ 5 seconds rule/ start and you’ll build momentum/ eat the frog/ quit the illusion of perfectionism/ use the pomodoro  technique. While all these are great suggestions, they still don’t work for me because my problem is the inability to focus on the task from the non-stop fearful thoughts. It feels like multitasking between working on the task and trying to quiet my brain or respond to the persistent anxious thoughts (which a lot of the time sound rational and worthy of attention so, I always fall for it). My fear response slows me down so much, I don’t know what to do about it!! All of this creates quite a stressful, resulting in a feedback loop that makes me chronically procrastinate and conclude that I’m incompetent. I’ve been like this for many years and it’s starting to get worse. Nothing has worked. Body doubling helps only a little and not all the time. I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and CPTSD and have been doing therapy and taking meds for many years yet. I haven’t gotten any better with procrastination and I’ve been so frustrated about it all, to the point that I’ve gotten depressed because I continue to resent myself for being incompetent.

This was different. I could tell I had fallen in love and it was horrible. I did have waves of euphoria but they were followed by huge amounts of anxiety. I couldn't concentrate on anything. I had to keep moving so I can discharge all that energy. It was terrible. 

Finally when I couldn't take it anymore and I asked the girl on a date. To which she responded that she's engaged and that she's a lesbian.

I should have felt heartbroken, but I felt relieved. Like the nightmare was over and I could breathe again. I had closure.

i asked him if i can do anything to support him in this difficult time but he doesnt want to talk about his inner world and is blocking and builds a wall. i just feel so disconnected to him and i dont know how to support him because he isnt communicating his needs. idk if he needs space or me just being there. idk whats going on in his mind and im just trying to understand his symptoms and the best ways to support him but i cant solve our relationship struggles on my own. i dont want to lose him and i love him so much.

However, there is a part of the condition that she is really struggling with and I'm totally at a loss currently on how to help. 

A good part of her GAD focuses on her health, and on being left out or cheated on in a relationship. Once she gets a thought hyperfocused, we cant turn the panic attack and anxiety off. For hours or days.

She will logically know the fear isnt real. She will have talked herself down rationally. She gas the ability to continue on with her day as far as taking care of chores and errands. But the entire time, she is raging mad inside, horribly scared and has to constantly fight the urge to let a full blown panic attack happen. Its exhausting for her and there hasnt been any improvement, despite what we have tried. She can sleep a full 8 hours, and wake up STILL in that mood. She wont even be mentally bothered but her mind and body will not stop reacting. 

 I'm not annoyed, frustrated or tired. Im not at my wits end, I'm not even doing this in desperation. She has simply figured out that this facet of the disorder is her biggest struggle, and she has come to me asking for help and advice as someone who deals with a lot. 

In short, I'm here asking others with the disorder, who deal with similar frustrations to let me know what has worked for you.

I was put on medicine and took myself off (wasn’t smart), but as soon as I started my first job, it came back. I tried to wean myself off again, and it wasn’t working. I started seeing a psychiatrist this past September. He’s been great and for several months I felt great. It wasn’t until after I sat for a CPA Exam that i started to feel anxiety again for a few weeks. Perhaps I was awaiting the score, but all went well. A week later, the pandemic and quarantine started around St Pattys Day. Pretty much since then, I’ve been on and off. One good week, one off week. Two good weeks, one off week. And I don’t even know if off is the right word. It doesn’t last the whole week or even a whole day, but it’s this constant monitoring to see if I’m anxious and how I feel. My anxiety has become this general feeling of uneasiness and worry with constant rumination. When I feel good, things are rolling along and I can’t understand how I get caught in my web of anxiety. However, on the flip side, once I’m caught, it feels as though I’ll never get out (even though I always do and I know there is no danger). So I don’t even know if I’m technically experiencing anxiety at this point, or I’m psyching myself out due to fear and the past. Isn’t it bad that in the fall I went months feeling good and now I’m on and off all of a sudden? My doctor is contemplating putting me on 40mg, but wants to see what happens after lockdown. He says everyone is struggling right now, which I get. I’m extremely analytical and my worse fear is this lasting forever. I even see posts I made a year ago asking questions regarding anxiety, so it seems I’m in the same spot. My anxiety used to be panic attacks but now it is the symptoms I described. I exercise, I’ve read books on it, but it always comes back. I don’t wanna go on more medicine because I want to get off it one day. If it’s necessary I guess I don’t have a choice. How can I keep getting caught in the same trap every other damn week? Is there something wrong with me? Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give an opinion/advice/help?

so i guess this is kind of a question/experience. has anyone else experienced a strong urge to throw up while having anxiety/panic attacks? not in the ""i feel naseous, need to throw up"" way, but more bulimic tendencies like actually scheduling time to go to the restroom at school and making yourself throw up? 

i struggled with this exact problem for about a month this year before the lockdown, when i was going through a very stressful situation. it was NOT related to my weight at all, i'm actually losing weight too fast bc of my meds. 

(i am not doing this anymore. mostly because my country is in lockdown and i'm at home with my entire family 24/7. our bathroom walls and foors are both made if milk glass and would make descreetly throwing up not very possible.) 

thankfully my anxiety levels have gone down and i'm not feeling that urge anymore, but i am concerned that it will come back if i'm in a stressful situation like that again. so i guess i'm just sharing this to ask if anyone else has had these feelings due to high anxiety. or if this could be a symptom not of my anxiety disorder, but potentially bulimia.

87,"Hi, Im 20 and to make a long story short , I've been struggling with GAD, depression, selfharm and suicidal thoughts for almost all my life having had my first panic attack at 9 years old. 8 months ago I got into a long distance relationship since then my anxiety is worsining by the hour. today, something just made me really on edge and I have a routine of calling my boyfriend and talking to him for a half an hour or an hour then we dont talk till the next day. today, Ive been calling him and he doesnt respond at all i start getting really anxious and i feel like my heart is gonna stop then he answers me and I go off on him, he was sleeping and still was very sleepy when I woke him up, After hanging up, I broke down and went to my bathroom and self harmed, I still feel like absolute shit and my suicidal thoughts are constantly on my mind. getting therapy while quarantining is very expencive and medication doesnt help anymore, advice ?",GAD
88,"Anyone else deal with this? I already follow the emetophobia page and it’s helpful. 

I’ve felt this for years now. I also have anxiety for other reasons, but this is awful at times. Anything that triggers the thought of throwing up - which can be a stomach ache, nausea, dizziness, or just hearing about someone who’s been sick - makes the anxiety worse. There are times when I’m perfectly OK and other times when the anxiety surrounding throwing up affects me for days or weeks until I can get my mind away from it. 

Today at work, I had a stomach ache, I kept focusing on the ache and it made it worse. My stomach felt like it was burning. My heart started racing and it made me feel like I could throw up. After a few mins, I got myself to calm down enough and the burning feeling in my stomach went away. 

It’s awful man.. anything that involves throw up or the feeling of it, I’m in straight panic mode. I can totally create the feeling in my head. One time I actually got sick in the middle of the night and to this day I think it was from making myself anxious about a feeling in my stomach...",GAD
89,"Some background: I'm diagnosed Bipolar (I'm on lithium), OCD, and GAD. My anxiety gets so bad some times that I'll be unable to function in a normal situation. (I once stood at the door of a party and stared at a wall for 10 minutes straight clutching a box. When I finally moved, I perched onto of a chair and curled up around my water bottle. Or I'll refuse to go into buildings my body deems unsafe.) 

Seeing as I live in the New York-  New Jersey area,  I should say life that last month has been atypical.  I'm temporarily displaced from my daily routine and I had to form a new schedule.  And I'm finding in this new, uncertain schedule, my anxiety is getting worse.  

My psychiatrist and I started an approach 2-ish years ago, to control the bipolar disorder.  And that has leveled off.  But now that we are here, in quarantine (shelter in place) I'm so anxious.  Does anyone have any tips on how to talk to my psychiatrist? I 'see"" her on Monday. I've started journaling when I have panic attacks and what triggered them and if it's related to an OCD episode or not.  But is there anything I should be including? I rarely talk fo her about anxiety, and if we do it's not really a problem.  I know reddit wont know what my psychiatrist will ask, but if you could help me prepare for the questions so I'll have appropriate answers, that would be awesome.  



Some of the fears focus on: 
Interpersonal relationships (mainly I just entered a new relationship and I'm head over heels for him and I'm terrified I'm not enough. And my best friends leaving me because I'm ""crazy."" As I put it.) 

My life in general (am I in the right field, how do I maximize my career, am I doing the right thing?) 

Being/doing enough (this one is very very steady in my life.  My parents always pushed me to do more and often punished rest.  So now that in home 24/7, I spend the day from 10am-5PM cleaning and doing housework and trying to progress my future. And then I make dinner for my family, clean and walk the dogs.

90,"I've recently had a panic attack and i'm still dealing with the aftermath, up until yesterday I still had some mild chest pains and hyperventilation. I was prescribed 10mg of Prozac (i'm 4 days in now) and ever since my panic attack I've been having this really unsettling sensation in my head that often comes with dizziness. It's not pain but it feels like someone is applying pressure in my head and I can feel it around the centre of my face so behind my eyes, my cheekbones and both of my ears, and it usually only appears when i'm anxious and when i'm laying down to go to bed.

91,"Last year or so, I was referred to a psychiatrist (I think that’s the right word I’m sorry my medical lingo not great) to talk about my anxiety disorder.  My anxiety surges in amazing highs and lows, where one day I think I’m the best contender for Prime Minister, and the next I think I’ll be a crack head for the rest of my life. My therapist thinks my anxiety is chronic, and that I was probably born with it or developed it in early childhood. The psychiatrist said that while I definitely met the standards for having GAD, my level of day-to-day functioning does “not require intervention on our part.” Basically, he said I didn’t need any drugs, and that if I wanted to, I didn’t even have to keep seeing my therapist anymore. 
I don’t see my therapist anymore, and it’s been over a year since I’ve taken a psychiatric drug. My anxiety is still pretty much the same, and sometimes I really feel like I should be in therapy or medicated to help with it. But when I called back to my local mental health clinic, my anxieties described in the intake interview were “not serious enough to warrant our action.” 
Basically: does anyone else have any similar experience with this kind of thing? Honestly just hoping someone tells me I’m not crazy 😂",GAD
92,"Hi so im someone who has gone through a lot of anxiety and depression in my childhood... I don't know when it started just because for the longest time, I thought it was the norm. My deepest point was when I graduated highschool. That is when I had suicidal thoughts... Sometimes i would try to commit suicide but ending up not doing it anyway as thinking about death also triggers my anxiety. And me already having a grasp of what was happening to me probably helps, as at those times I already have done my research about depression, anxiety, suicidal and such. I have a better understanding of my situation and can make myself calm by doing things that are right like postponing it(basically telling myself if i want to commit suicide, I have to do it tomorrow) which basically will not happen anyway as i will experience a whole different kind of emotion at that time. It's just that when i tell someone about my anxiety and depression i have been through, i feel like i can't tell them that I'm also suicidal as I never did it anyway, as I was afraid of doing it anyway, so I feel like they were invalid.

I had some stronger pill on the second night but it didn't do anything. 3,8mg of melatonin last night didn't seem to work either. After 22 hours I'll be able to call into my employer and probably get someone to talk to, and hopefully a medication that would stop this particular attack. I already learned how to cope with this and what works for me and what doesn't. I'm mentally in a good state most of the time but my body won't let it go.

Hoping for some advice. 

Was on cipralex for 7 years and it allowed me to be happy and live life. Then it stopped working! I was on a high dose. 

Since then, have tried:

Fetzima- gave me heart palpitations and high BP
Lyrica- kept breaking through despite upped doses
Propranalol- just made me tired, no other effects 
Trintellix-just didn’t feel good on it after 2 months. No real change to my mood. 

Currently on 300mg of Trileptal which is a mood stabilizer, and not doing so well. 

My thoughts are to try another SSRI such as Zoloft or Prozac, given how well Cipralex worked for me.  Or, try another SSRI, perhaps Pristiq, cymbalta or Effexor. 

I don’t like cocktails of meds, as I find it’s impossible to know what’s doing what. I think my last cocktail made me worse.

I had derealization 24/7 for 9-10 months but have snapped out of it, still get feelings of unreality on some days but it's not where near as bad. My main concern is that I am paranoid of being paranoid and it scares me so much. Ever since I was robbed I became mistrusting of people and when I was attacked I had a panic attack which put me in a sever state of depersonalization. Since then I began researching symptoms of schitzophrenia and is something I dwell on 24/7 it's always on the back of my mind. The biggest problem is that whenever I see something, I.e a person in a suit with a suitcase, if it resembles what you'd see in a movie, the person looking like an agent, I start to ecesssively think about why I though that and end up worrying about it all day. But at the time it happens it feels so real like I feel fear inside of me and am terrified. I am extremely scared of going insane and losing touch with reality. I also think I could have some ptsd as am very jumpy but I don't have any nightmares or flashbacks. It has sort of become an obsession. Whenever I get a depersonalization attack it makes me feel that everything around me is fake and this puts a seed of strong fear in me which makes me freak out and worry that am being paranoid and that eventually It's going to turn into a full blown phsycosis. I spoke to phsyciatrist as over 8 months ago and they were consistent in telling me it is not schitzophrenia. What worries me the most is the overwhelming feelings of paranoi that I get or is it the anxiety and fear that I feel. I don't believe the paranoia and know it's irrational but it just feels so real in the moment. Please could someone help.
