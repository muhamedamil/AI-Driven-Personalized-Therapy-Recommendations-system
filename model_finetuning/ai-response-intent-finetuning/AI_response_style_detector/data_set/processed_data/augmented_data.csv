ocd is a mechanism that your brain puts up to deal with high constant anxiety,disgust,hoarding disorder
"Contrary to the common belief OCD, it is not a question of being organized in order and therefore on what the DOC is a thought or an obsession that insinuates itself into your head through sensory stimuli or a flow of thoughts and attracting all your attention can last for hours or weeks also the degree of obsession based on the obsession based on factors based on different factors based on these times based on your head, in this case, you can also think of this Thiggs. Or from this an emotional and physical response a combat or flight response that makes the real obsession feel for the affected person what follows is a suggestion from your brain that should make everything right that it makes you save your loved ones that your obsession disappears and anxiety with it is a constraint that is usually felt with a meaning with a meaning that also absent to make a degradation that does not feel something that does not feel something that does not feel something that does not feel like doing something. Even something that does not feel to do something that does not feel to do something that does not feel to do something that does not feel even a degradation that does not feel something to do something that does not feel something that you do not do something that does not feel something that you also feel to do something to degrade, who does not feel even something that does not feel you do something that does not feel to do something that does not feel something that does not feel something that does not hear something That you do not feel something that you don't feel to do something degradation, that you are even if you don't feel. This can request from a few seconds to minutes depending on how shocking the obsession with you with the really strong compulsive disorder, the obsession may not even go with only a compulsion and you may need to make more than one in that case that requires even sometimes really strong hours that obsessive thoughts can return to persecute months or even years later
So the DOC is a mechanism that your brain puts itself to face a constant constant anxiety often the source of anxiety is something out of your control, so your brain transforms your attention on something you can actually control
Making the compulsion is actually making the OCD stronger, it is strengthening the entire cycle that begins with an obsession that comes in your head, makes the subsequent obsessions more vivid and real and the subsequent less and less effective compulsions, the more you use them to combat obsessions, the case of OCD is a coincidence so that people develop so as to eval, therefore a case of Evalvio develops, therefore a case develop so that they develop so that They develop in order to eval a case so that a case develop from OCD.

it took away my childhood i have never talked about this openly with anyone except my best,disgust,hoarding disorder
"i honestly think it took away my childhood
i have never talked about this openly with anyone i know except my best friend and even she knows very little
i know i shouldnt be complaining i live in an extremely nice neighborhood i am fed three times a day i have a good education and i am very blessed but it is awful to live with a hoarder
basically my father is a hoarder who refuses to admit his problem not only do we have an entire garage filled completely with random garbage from multiple bikes to old tires to gardening tools to broken furniture to a sauna like an actual wooden sauna and no it has never been usedi mean seriously you cant even open the door to get inside because there is absolutely no way to get inside generally the entire front and back yard are a complete mess
the worst though is inside we have  or  coffee makers our living room is filled to the brim with random things from boxes of old tools to furniture piled up to an exercise machine to photographs and weights and everything in between the basement is unlivable honest to god it is filled from the floor to the ceiling with furniture a drum set old art supplies kilns and various other things when a fuse is blown i have to carefully climb over all of the junk to get to the fusebox afraid to cut my feet on rusty nails and sharp edges
this leaves the only clean room in the house my room i honestly think i developed some sort of ocd from living in this environment i cant concentrate unless my room is meticulously clean and if i walk on the floor and step on crumbs or dirt i feel agitated and uncomfortable my biggest fear is becoming a hoarder and living in my own filth one day so whenever i feel i have to many things i am quick to throw stuff away
to be honest ive had issues with living in this hoarding house since i was young when i was very little it began to impact me when i turned about  i started to make friends who i wanted to have playdates with their parents would call mine inviting me over and i would go ahead and do that i would ask my mom and dad if i could invite them over and they told me i couldnt because of the mess i didnt mind but what i did mind was when my friends started asking me questions about why i never invited them over a few of them thought i was strange because of it or they thought i didnt like them because i didnt invite them and because my mom told me to not tell anybody about the mess because she was embarrassed i began making up lies lies such as we have construction on the house or my dad is installing a hot tub my entire life im  right now i have never invited somebody over to my house i never had a play date when i was little never invited my friends to hang out
looking back i realize that it kind of took over the way i lived my life as a kid i began distancing myself from my friends whenever i began to get close enough to someone at school where they asked me to hang out with them i would quickly push them away or refuse their requests to hang out until they stopped asking i became pretty depressed in th grade i wasnt old enough to go places other than houses to hang out with my friends i had this deep embarrassment and shame about my house
i often spent hours a day cleaning the kitchen and living room organizing things because my dad would scream at me if i threw anything away until it looked almost passable for a house my dad would come home praise me for neatening up but immediately after fill the clean areas with more junk at some point after hours and hours of my childhood wasted on cleaning and organizing and cleaning and organizing i simply could not do anymore everytime i made room to live and walk around my dad would fill it up with more junk it was extremely disheartening and eventually i stopped altogether and it currently looks worse than ever
this all started to be less impactful on my social life after about th grade i started to realize that i could bike places take the bus the train etc so i could have the freedom to hang out with my friends in other places other than our homes for the first time in my life i actually had a group of close friends who i often hung out with and was able to talk to still their parents would sometimes drop me off in front of my house and the car would get quiet i know that everybody was staring and wondering what kind of shit hole i lived in so i still ask people to drop me off at the corner of my street so i dont have to face the judgement of my friends parents and be afraid of what they say about me and my family
the neighborhood i live in is very suburban and nice which is excellent of course because i am safe and am getting a good education i understand that fully now but when i was little all i understood was that every house around me was neat and beautiful and none of my friends parents had a living room and basement and upstairs and garage full of garbage i felt so different from everybody and especially with the snotty rich people who live in my area people who saw my house were very judgmental
another issue living with a hoarder entails is my parents fighting my dad is the hoarder meanwhile my mom is a neat freak she grew up in a very tidy environment and is an extremely tidy person every day since i was younger she would come home from work tired and yell at me and my brother about the mess and yell at us about how my dad never kept clean i mean actually screaming at us and banging dishes around then my dad would get home and they would fight again and again
the worst part of it all is that my dad doesnt understand his problem whenever my family confronts him he defends himself by saying i could throw it away if i wanted to but honestly he will never want to i am not sure why he has such an issue with throwing anything away it is still a mystery what in his past caused him to act this way i think it is extremely selfish of him as much as i love him because it impacted both me and my brothers childhoods to an extremely along with the social life of my mother she has often told me that she doesnt give her address to coworkers just in case they try to stop by some day and she has no choice but to let them in and allow them to see the houses mess
there have been a few instances where my brother and i have cried and my dad realized what his hoarding was doing to us when he attempts to clean he picks up every single item old reciepts photographs boxes furniture tools he picks through them so slowly and when he throws things away you can tell he hates it quite a lot and feels extremely unhappy about it usually he will get halfway through a specific area before stopping for the day and never trying again
anyways i am not that bitter about it i just hope to share my experience with other people and i am sure there are others going through this i hope you understand you are not alone i felt very alone when i was younger but i now know there are many others who have experienced this as well you cannot change the mind of a hoarder it is not your fault that they act as they do and you cannot simply change their habits they are what they are
as bad as it has been it will be over soon in  years when i am  i am going to go to college and will finally be free of this mess until then",disgust,hoarding disorder

From my experience, it is an suffocating disorder that always scratches when I am in the foreground in my mind, regardless of the situation I cannot escape the reality that I am a deformed, abyss creature that looks ugliness. As a result of BDD, contrary to the conviction, it is not related to eating disorders at all, although yes comorbidities can occur. The DSM classifies BDD in the chapter of obsessive employment and related disorders together with OCD and several other disorders. Obsessions and forced combination should deal with the somatic symptoms.
Most things trigger me
Every word to describe physical aesthetics
To see a woman with all the facial features that I wish for a man myself
Mirror
reflections
Compliments
Pictures made of me
Cameras near me or around me aimed at
See someone with the properties that I hate myself
Symmetry in the face of peoples
Asymmetry on the faces of people
This disturbance is terrible that it has ruined my enjoyment in so many situations about something that from the moment I wake up until the moment when I go to bed. I can't escape my thoughts
If I were more beautiful, I wouldn't have to feel that way
My nose is huge, why does it have to have a bump in the middle
Why can't I be beautiful
Why can't I look normal
Why do I look like this?
I am a disgusting lazy -looking monster
These words always feel like mucus in my brain, but they won't stop
And when people are annoyed or say what they see, it's not true
They lie
You just don't want to admit that I look terrible
You are just nice
I can never believe that people say something beautiful about my appearance, my brain is wired with reflexes to deny in these moments. I'm looking for consolation from the BDD community on various websites that use a hashtag
I worked for so long to get the body I want
Years ago I would never have taken a photo of my body without posing
I see a lot of people who use BDD as an interchangeable term with eating disorders that I have seen how people have published this type of images, and I see an edececovery after the BDD one of the specific requirements for the preservation of a diagnosis of BDD is the differentiation of eating disorders if appearance only deals with the focus from the appearance disorders. In the case of excessive fat or weight and the patient, symptoms correspond to diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder, then an eating disorder should be diagnosed, not BDD that have been removed from the diagnosis of BDD BDD
So when I go to these communities who are looking for solidarity and support, I am sometimes greeted with people who do not know what BDD is, and it makes me sad because it reminds me of how far it is at a time until people understand this disorder correctly

You can suffer from gender dysphoria only if you feel like you were born in the wrong genre or you have a discomfort in the parts of your body that make you your sex this leads to the desire to cut the parts of the sexual body and move on to the opposite sex
The dysmorfia body makes anguish an anguish on one's body whatever it is
For example, someone can have the doughfish of the body on their weight and feel disgusted by it making the person anguished on it, but this experience is exclusive only for the dysmorphy of the body while the gender dysphoria is linked to the exclusive genre but if you are thinking about something similar to this scenario
A biological man is distressed and shameful for his female facial characteristics and thinking that he is not male enough causing anguish

Don't look for a problem or you will surely find one. I don't see that as an obsessive -compulsive disorder. I will tell you about a woman who is the daughter of a long -time client of mine. Maybe you will refer to your story
This young woman is twenty -four she is beautiful. Your hair is full and lush. She has a beautiful face that she is slimmer now that when she was when she eats bread in Paris every day to look at her, she could be a model
However, when this young woman sees her reflection, she only sees how terrible her skin is, how ugly she is everything she hates, she hates her constantly on everything on her face and leaves brands that her beautiful face with her obsessed observation and picking scars and scars herself and picked herself.
We create with our heads, we are all faulty as humans
Instead, concentrate on how to change your perspective and find gratitude for your beautiful eyes hair muscles and body, instead of looking at the imperfections.
Energy flows where our attention flows, wherever we concentrate. Our energy grows in size and strength. So concentrate on the good.
How
Decide when we decide that there is something better than the misery we live and do everything that is necessary to change our attitude and perspective that will change
For yourself, undertake to no longer look at your mistakes and instead concentrate on your good strengths and beautiful parts. It does not mean that the other does not exist. It only means that your focus and perspective come from the uplifting and more trust building.
As soon as we find out how negative we are, we can change these thoughts and words as positive negativity, how it creates an acidic environment in her body in which the disease grows when I was negative.
Determination is determined to have a happier life full of joy instead of changing misery, and the thoughts change the way they feel every day and strengthen happiness
You will find gratitude to be alive, a prayer as soon as your eyes are open. People die a gift every day that life is a simple prayer. Thank you for my life, thank you for living to live another day and be a better version of me. Thanks. Thanks for the food on the table and my eyes that pass my leash and my hands that die with the greetings from cancer. To open and you will find more good in your life if you concentrate on it
Discipline that comes to the place of happiness takes discipline that the human mind prepares for negative thinking when we consider this to be the gym if you do not go to the gym and train every day that the body is not fit. Hold
Depth Depth every day Most people with a little feeling of self -confidence either hold their breath or breathe flat to slowly breathe in the lower abdomen and slowly exhale deep belly in your body every morning, so that you do not feel so scattered, take up more space and confirm life with deep belly atmosphere

My girlfriend calls her well, Jane has cleaning standards as far as possible. I never feel disgusting when I'm in your tight house

Her parents were divorced when she was young and her father took off when he took all his things with him, he took her toys or something, but he took his turntable and stool objects with which she grew up with
Then, when she was a teenager and lived with her mother, her house lost fire. The fire has completely lost her room all year books.
Her mother did not get a lot of money from the insurance company, so they struggled to replace the loss of the school that the school had to help her and her mother, who had a large part of her high school career with her colleagues.
Nowadays she is a compulsive online buyer every time I come to her house

"The hoarding of the expression is now in our social lexicon and has its own diagnostic category, but it is fundamentally an anxiety disorder and under the broader psychopathology related to the obsessive compulsive disorder or the personality of OC, the first is dystonic ego and disgusting for the person and the second is synthetic that means its acceptable and does not bother you with the rules and procedures that my exes are and my forms of control and my forms of control and my forms of control and my forms of control and my ways of controlling and my control 
It is deeper than a habit like brushing the teeth in the wrong way and correcting someone or even making it brushed if they do not accumulate goes to the root of an individual feared fears and is an unconscious way to reduce anxiety that are not aware of
It is a bit like the magical thinking that compulsive obsessive people use an act that repeats certain phrases or words thinking certain thoughts that are associated with making things psychologically safer in the control of life.
The hoarding is a chronic doubt and Freud refers to compulsive obsessive forms of being a type of mania that doubts about things about the things that have no control and when performing the compulsive act that a magically acquires a sense of control and a reduction of fear, but everything that happens by conscious consciousness, which is why it is unless one has a relationship of disciplined therapy with someone like what comes to this moment, even what comes to this moment. You can make a relationship with the people of the obsessives. Very challenging personality disorder or disorder
There will always be a reason why the person keeps the stores in the stores that are and from the outside it seems false how many fill in blank you need and rational thinking about accumulated things will not impress the person or change their thinking because it is not about how many things they curl up, but the unconscious have to maintain that separate association
The necessary psychological security between the patient and the therapist is a very important precursor before the connections can begin to be considered and much less work
Then, you will see that it is a habit in some sense of the word, but what supports it and protects it must be respected while creating sufficiently enough confidence so that the person begins to connect the previously separated parts and begins
Then people have real control and can slowly give up their illusory control through ritual monopolty practices, etc., a kind of giving up magic and fears of clashes
Be a friend, a good friend if you care about this person, but do not think you will change them, people change if they see the need to do so, most people do not because it is the rest of us who often we are often more annoying about their problems than them and would say the same about us. 
Do not underestimate these behaviors as necessary by the person and if they are willing to get help, if not, unless they are also incompetent and the court has ruled about that or a risk for them To people who commit to people who commit people who commit people who commit people who commit to people who commit themselves.

It is deeper than a habit of brushing your teeth incorrectly and correcting someone or even causing someone to brush if you do not hoard, fear the root of an individual, and it is an unconscious way of reducing fear that you are not aware of
It is a little like magical thinking that compulsive people use to carry out an action that repeats certain phrases or words that think certain thoughts that are connected to make things into the control of life mentally more psychologically
Horten is about chronic doubts, and Freud referred to compulsive ways to be a kind of doubtful mania through which you do not have control, and by carrying out the compulsive act, he magically gives him a feeling of control and a reduction in fear, but everything that goes from conscious awareness. or very challenging personality disorder
There will always be a reason why the person saves saving business, whatever it is, and from the outside it does not appear to be true how many fill the gap, and rational thinking about those who are obvious, the person will not impress or their thinking will not change because it is not about how many things they belong, but the unconscious connection between the act of in their in their thoughts and the unchanging. must keep this association separately
The psychological security between the patient and the therapist is a very important forerunner before the connections can be considered, let alone work through
So you see that it is a habit in a certain sense of the word, but what it supports and protects has to be respected, while the person gently trusts to connect the previously separate parts and put the parts together in a now meaningful whole
Then people have real control and can slowly give up their illusory control by hoarding ritual practices, etc.
Be a friend a good friend if you take care of this person, but I don't think you will change her. People change when they see the need to do this 
Do not underestimate such behaviors as from the person and if you are willing to receive great help, if not, unless you are also incompetent and the Court of Justice has decided on this or a risk for yourself or others. There is nothing to do, but people are entitled to have their problems, even if we believe that they are not ugly.

"Hello assuming that many of us have a certain tendency to accumulate without morbidity could be in the context of collecting certain objects from a love and a passion for these or someone thinks in practical terms and clings to things because they could be used later
We refer to those collectors who collect something indiscriminately for an overwhelming desire to keep things not in particular but nothing
The accumulation tends to be difficult or even impossible to control is the act of receiving something in one's life is probably a compulsive act for the individual that the act of clinging to the objects that give them a space in the house to be knowing that it is there at a reach
A pathological tendency to accumulate can be seen as an ideally attachment disorder that an individual needs attachment to the need and the prevalent type varies according to a person's mature phase will be satisfied in the past, but obviously we know that this has not made mental needs manifest during their mental life that had mental behavior and was not serious

There may be a preference for things that are taken orally or for mandatory shopping that play everything that tends to be exaggerated with more than normal enthusiasm and that could be a significant trait in a person's character

it took away my childhood i have never talked about this openly with anyone except my best,disgust,hoarding disorder
"i honestly think it took away my childhood
i have never talked about this openly with anyone i know except my best friend and even she knows very little
i know i shouldnt be complaining i live in an extremely nice neighborhood i am fed three times a day i have a good education and i am very blessed but it is awful to live with a hoarder
basically my father is a hoarder who refuses to admit his problem not only do we have an entire garage filled completely with random garbage from multiple bikes to old tires to gardening tools to broken furniture to a sauna like an actual wooden sauna and no it has never been usedi mean seriously you cant even open the door to get inside because there is absolutely no way to get inside generally the entire front and back yard are a complete mess
the worst though is inside we have  or  coffee makers our living room is filled to the brim with random things from boxes of old tools to furniture piled up to an exercise machine to photographs and weights and everything in between the basement is unlivable honest to god it is filled from the floor to the ceiling with furniture a drum set old art supplies kilns and various other things when a fuse is blown i have to carefully climb over all of the junk to get to the fusebox afraid to cut my feet on rusty nails and sharp edges
this leaves the only clean room in the house my room i honestly think i developed some sort of ocd from living in this environment i cant concentrate unless my room is meticulously clean and if i walk on the floor and step on crumbs or dirt i feel agitated and uncomfortable my biggest fear is becoming a hoarder and living in my own filth one day so whenever i feel i have to many things i am quick to throw stuff away
to be honest ive had issues with living in this hoarding house since i was young when i was very little it began to impact me when i turned about  i started to make friends who i wanted to have playdates with their parents would call mine inviting me over and i would go ahead and do that i would ask my mom and dad if i could invite them over and they told me i couldnt because of the mess i didnt mind but what i did mind was when my friends started asking me questions about why i never invited them over a few of them thought i was strange because of it or they thought i didnt like them because i didnt invite them and because my mom told me to not tell anybody about the mess because she was embarrassed i began making up lies lies such as we have construction on the house or my dad is installing a hot tub my entire life im  right now i have never invited somebody over to my house i never had a play date when i was little never invited my friends to hang out
looking back i realize that it kind of took over the way i lived my life as a kid i began distancing myself from my friends whenever i began to get close enough to someone at school where they asked me to hang out with them i would quickly push them away or refuse their requests to hang out until they stopped asking i became pretty depressed in th grade i wasnt old enough to go places other than houses to hang out with my friends i had this deep embarrassment and shame about my house
i often spent hours a day cleaning the kitchen and living room organizing things because my dad would scream at me if i threw anything away until it looked almost passable for a house my dad would come home praise me for neatening up but immediately after fill the clean areas with more junk at some point after hours and hours of my childhood wasted on cleaning and organizing and cleaning and organizing i simply could not do anymore everytime i made room to live and walk around my dad would fill it up with more junk it was extremely disheartening and eventually i stopped altogether and it currently looks worse than ever
this all started to be less impactful on my social life after about th grade i started to realize that i could bike places take the bus the train etc so i could have the freedom to hang out with my friends in other places other than our homes for the first time in my life i actually had a group of close friends who i often hung out with and was able to talk to still their parents would sometimes drop me off in front of my house and the car would get quiet i know that everybody was staring and wondering what kind of shit hole i lived in so i still ask people to drop me off at the corner of my street so i dont have to face the judgement of my friends parents and be afraid of what they say about me and my family
the neighborhood i live in is very suburban and nice which is excellent of course because i am safe and am getting a good education i understand that fully now but when i was little all i understood was that every house around me was neat and beautiful and none of my friends parents had a living room and basement and upstairs and garage full of garbage i felt so different from everybody and especially with the snotty rich people who live in my area people who saw my house were very judgmental
another issue living with a hoarder entails is my parents fighting my dad is the hoarder meanwhile my mom is a neat freak she grew up in a very tidy environment and is an extremely tidy person every day since i was younger she would come home from work tired and yell at me and my brother about the mess and yell at us about how my dad never kept clean i mean actually screaming at us and banging dishes around then my dad would get home and they would fight again and again
the worst part of it all is that my dad doesnt understand his problem whenever my family confronts him he defends himself by saying i could throw it away if i wanted to but honestly he will never want to i am not sure why he has such an issue with throwing anything away it is still a mystery what in his past caused him to act this way i think it is extremely selfish of him as much as i love him because it impacted both me and my brothers childhoods to an extremely along with the social life of my mother she has often told me that she doesnt give her address to coworkers just in case they try to stop by some day and she has no choice but to let them in and allow them to see the houses mess
there have been a few instances where my brother and i have cried and my dad realized what his hoarding was doing to us when he attempts to clean he picks up every single item old reciepts photographs boxes furniture tools he picks through them so slowly and when he throws things away you can tell he hates it quite a lot and feels extremely unhappy about it usually he will get halfway through a specific area before stopping for the day and never trying again
anyways i am not that bitter about it i just hope to share my experience with other people and i am sure there are others going through this i hope you understand you are not alone i felt very alone when i was younger but i now know there are many others who have experienced this as well you cannot change the mind of a hoarder it is not your fault that they act as they do and you cannot simply change their habits they are what they are
as bad as it has been it will be over soon in  years when i am  i am going to go to college and will finally be free of this mess until then",disgust,hoarding disorder

The person will not open the door more than a few centimeters if knocking
The curtains are always drawn
There is card recorded above the windows or on those translucent stickers that you can get in the hardware archive
The same light is always on in the evening, but never others who suggest that the person sits in a place usually from TV and rarely goes into rooms full of accumulated materials
The house smells of cat urine
See the person who brings many things, but their weekly pickup is very modest
The person lives alone
If you live the next door, you start to have a problem with mice mice or cockroaches
The person looks around to see if someone is looking at them when they carry things inside
They never put out the recycling basket
Observes the person who strikes in the trash of other people
Rotted windows or similar visible damage are not repaired
The air conditioners of the window are not removed to the cold usually because the person can no longer access it
Some of these can be signs of financial discomfort or physical infirmity rather than accumulating never jump in the conclusions

"i honestly think it took away my childhood
i have never talked about this openly with anyone i know except my best friend and even she knows very little
i know i shouldnt be complaining i live in an extremely nice neighborhood i am fed three times a day i have a good education and i am very blessed but it is awful to live with a hoarder
basically my father is a hoarder who refuses to admit his problem not only do we have an entire garage filled completely with random garbage from multiple bikes to old tires to gardening tools to broken furniture to a sauna like an actual wooden sauna and no it has never been usedi mean seriously you cant even open the door to get inside because there is absolutely no way to get inside generally the entire front and back yard are a complete mess
the worst though is inside we have  or  coffee makers our living room is filled to the brim with random things from boxes of old tools to furniture piled up to an exercise machine to photographs and weights and everything in between the basement is unlivable honest to god it is filled from the floor to the ceiling with furniture a drum set old art supplies kilns and various other things when a fuse is blown i have to carefully climb over all of the junk to get to the fusebox afraid to cut my feet on rusty nails and sharp edges
this leaves the only clean room in the house my room i honestly think i developed some sort of ocd from living in this environment i cant concentrate unless my room is meticulously clean and if i walk on the floor and step on crumbs or dirt i feel agitated and uncomfortable my biggest fear is becoming a hoarder and living in my own filth one day so whenever i feel i have to many things i am quick to throw stuff away
to be honest ive had issues with living in this hoarding house since i was young when i was very little it began to impact me when i turned about  i started to make friends who i wanted to have playdates with their parents would call mine inviting me over and i would go ahead and do that i would ask my mom and dad if i could invite them over and they told me i couldnt because of the mess i didnt mind but what i did mind was when my friends started asking me questions about why i never invited them over a few of them thought i was strange because of it or they thought i didnt like them because i didnt invite them and because my mom told me to not tell anybody about the mess because she was embarrassed i began making up lies lies such as we have construction on the house or my dad is installing a hot tub my entire life im  right now i have never invited somebody over to my house i never had a play date when i was little never invited my friends to hang out
looking back i realize that it kind of took over the way i lived my life as a kid i began distancing myself from my friends whenever i began to get close enough to someone at school where they asked me to hang out with them i would quickly push them away or refuse their requests to hang out until they stopped asking i became pretty depressed in th grade i wasnt old enough to go places other than houses to hang out with my friends i had this deep embarrassment and shame about my house
i often spent hours a day cleaning the kitchen and living room organizing things because my dad would scream at me if i threw anything away until it looked almost passable for a house my dad would come home praise me for neatening up but immediately after fill the clean areas with more junk at some point after hours and hours of my childhood wasted on cleaning and organizing and cleaning and organizing i simply could not do anymore everytime i made room to live and walk around my dad would fill it up with more junk it was extremely disheartening and eventually i stopped altogether and it currently looks worse than ever
this all started to be less impactful on my social life after about th grade i started to realize that i could bike places take the bus the train etc so i could have the freedom to hang out with my friends in other places other than our homes for the first time in my life i actually had a group of close friends who i often hung out with and was able to talk to still their parents would sometimes drop me off in front of my house and the car would get quiet i know that everybody was staring and wondering what kind of shit hole i lived in so i still ask people to drop me off at the corner of my street so i dont have to face the judgement of my friends parents and be afraid of what they say about me and my family
the neighborhood i live in is very suburban and nice which is excellent of course because i am safe and am getting a good education i understand that fully now but when i was little all i understood was that every house around me was neat and beautiful and none of my friends parents had a living room and basement and upstairs and garage full of garbage i felt so different from everybody and especially with the snotty rich people who live in my area people who saw my house were very judgmental
another issue living with a hoarder entails is my parents fighting my dad is the hoarder meanwhile my mom is a neat freak she grew up in a very tidy environment and is an extremely tidy person every day since i was younger she would come home from work tired and yell at me and my brother about the mess and yell at us about how my dad never kept clean i mean actually screaming at us and banging dishes around then my dad would get home and they would fight again and again
the worst part of it all is that my dad doesnt understand his problem whenever my family confronts him he defends himself by saying i could throw it away if i wanted to but honestly he will never want to i am not sure why he has such an issue with throwing anything away it is still a mystery what in his past caused him to act this way i think it is extremely selfish of him as much as i love him because it impacted both me and my brothers childhoods to an extremely along with the social life of my mother she has often told me that she doesnt give her address to coworkers just in case they try to stop by some day and she has no choice but to let them in and allow them to see the houses mess
there have been a few instances where my brother and i have cried and my dad realized what his hoarding was doing to us when he attempts to clean he picks up every single item old reciepts photographs boxes furniture tools he picks through them so slowly and when he throws things away you can tell he hates it quite a lot and feels extremely unhappy about it usually he will get halfway through a specific area before stopping for the day and never trying again
anyways i am not that bitter about it i just hope to share my experience with other people and i am sure there are others going through this i hope you understand you are not alone i felt very alone when i was younger but i now know there are many others who have experienced this as well you cannot change the mind of a hoarder it is not your fault that they act as they do and you cannot simply change their habits they are what they are
as bad as it has been it will be over soon in  years when i am  i am going to go to college and will finally be free of this mess until then",disgust,hoarding disorder

"Hello assuming that many of us have a certain tendency to accumulate without morbidity could be in the context of collecting certain objects from a love and a passion for these or someone thinks in practical terms and clings to things because they could be used later
We refer to those collectors who collect something indiscriminately for an overwhelming desire to keep things not in particular but nothing
The accumulation tends to be difficult or even impossible to control is the act of receiving something in one's life is probably a compulsive act for the individual that the act of clinging to the objects that give them a space in the house to be knowing that it is there at a reach
A pathological tendency to accumulate can be seen as an ideally attachment disorder that an individual needs attachment to the need and the prevalent type varies according to a person's mature phase will be satisfied in the past, but obviously we know that this has not made mental needs manifest during their mental life that had mental behavior and was not serious
In neuropsychiatric terms this may indicate a chronic exhaustion of the dopaminergic system following the negligence of a young human and perhaps also of an ancient life of an animal thinking of the well -known example of the geese that follow the individual who first recognizes for their extraordinary duration and the need to have their lives so that their childhood will keep their first life in case of maintenance and do not occur childish. There may be a preference for things that are taken orally or for mandatory shopping that play everything that tends to be exaggerated with more than normal enthusiasm and that could be a significant trait in a person's character

To simplify this, it is accumulating the house has been clean a little even if it is obvious that it is out of control it could be much worse
also accumulated but worse above
This is collecting
You see the difference with the accumulation of the treasure has taken control over people's lives and they are practically adapting to their accumulation instead of being able to enjoy it with a collector, they could have a ridiculous amount of everything they are collecting, but has not even taken into consideration his life, which will not be taken so that his life did not take himself so that he will take control of the Ard that that Cheved Cheved Outs.

it took away my childhood i have never talked about this openly with anyone except my best,disgust,hoarding disorder
"i honestly think it took away my childhood
i have never talked about this openly with anyone i know except my best friend and even she knows very little
i know i shouldnt be complaining i live in an extremely nice neighborhood i am fed three times a day i have a good education and i am very blessed but it is awful to live with a hoarder
basically my father is a hoarder who refuses to admit his problem not only do we have an entire garage filled completely with random garbage from multiple bikes to old tires to gardening tools to broken furniture to a sauna like an actual wooden sauna and no it has never been usedi mean seriously you cant even open the door to get inside because there is absolutely no way to get inside generally the entire front and back yard are a complete mess
the worst though is inside we have  or  coffee makers our living room is filled to the brim with random things from boxes of old tools to furniture piled up to an exercise machine to photographs and weights and everything in between the basement is unlivable honest to god it is filled from the floor to the ceiling with furniture a drum set old art supplies kilns and various other things when a fuse is blown i have to carefully climb over all of the junk to get to the fusebox afraid to cut my feet on rusty nails and sharp edges
this leaves the only clean room in the house my room i honestly think i developed some sort of ocd from living in this environment i cant concentrate unless my room is meticulously clean and if i walk on the floor and step on crumbs or dirt i feel agitated and uncomfortable my biggest fear is becoming a hoarder and living in my own filth one day so whenever i feel i have to many things i am quick to throw stuff away
to be honest ive had issues with living in this hoarding house since i was young when i was very little it began to impact me when i turned about  i started to make friends who i wanted to have playdates with their parents would call mine inviting me over and i would go ahead and do that i would ask my mom and dad if i could invite them over and they told me i couldnt because of the mess i didnt mind but what i did mind was when my friends started asking me questions about why i never invited them over a few of them thought i was strange because of it or they thought i didnt like them because i didnt invite them and because my mom told me to not tell anybody about the mess because she was embarrassed i began making up lies lies such as we have construction on the house or my dad is installing a hot tub my entire life im  right now i have never invited somebody over to my house i never had a play date when i was little never invited my friends to hang out
looking back i realize that it kind of took over the way i lived my life as a kid i began distancing myself from my friends whenever i began to get close enough to someone at school where they asked me to hang out with them i would quickly push them away or refuse their requests to hang out until they stopped asking i became pretty depressed in th grade i wasnt old enough to go places other than houses to hang out with my friends i had this deep embarrassment and shame about my house
i often spent hours a day cleaning the kitchen and living room organizing things because my dad would scream at me if i threw anything away until it looked almost passable for a house my dad would come home praise me for neatening up but immediately after fill the clean areas with more junk at some point after hours and hours of my childhood wasted on cleaning and organizing and cleaning and organizing i simply could not do anymore everytime i made room to live and walk around my dad would fill it up with more junk it was extremely disheartening and eventually i stopped altogether and it currently looks worse than ever
this all started to be less impactful on my social life after about th grade i started to realize that i could bike places take the bus the train etc so i could have the freedom to hang out with my friends in other places other than our homes for the first time in my life i actually had a group of close friends who i often hung out with and was able to talk to still their parents would sometimes drop me off in front of my house and the car would get quiet i know that everybody was staring and wondering what kind of shit hole i lived in so i still ask people to drop me off at the corner of my street so i dont have to face the judgement of my friends parents and be afraid of what they say about me and my family
the neighborhood i live in is very suburban and nice which is excellent of course because i am safe and am getting a good education i understand that fully now but when i was little all i understood was that every house around me was neat and beautiful and none of my friends parents had a living room and basement and upstairs and garage full of garbage i felt so different from everybody and especially with the snotty rich people who live in my area people who saw my house were very judgmental
another issue living with a hoarder entails is my parents fighting my dad is the hoarder meanwhile my mom is a neat freak she grew up in a very tidy environment and is an extremely tidy person every day since i was younger she would come home from work tired and yell at me and my brother about the mess and yell at us about how my dad never kept clean i mean actually screaming at us and banging dishes around then my dad would get home and they would fight again and again
the worst part of it all is that my dad doesnt understand his problem whenever my family confronts him he defends himself by saying i could throw it away if i wanted to but honestly he will never want to i am not sure why he has such an issue with throwing anything away it is still a mystery what in his past caused him to act this way i think it is extremely selfish of him as much as i love him because it impacted both me and my brothers childhoods to an extremely along with the social life of my mother she has often told me that she doesnt give her address to coworkers just in case they try to stop by some day and she has no choice but to let them in and allow them to see the houses mess
there have been a few instances where my brother and i have cried and my dad realized what his hoarding was doing to us when he attempts to clean he picks up every single item old reciepts photographs boxes furniture tools he picks through them so slowly and when he throws things away you can tell he hates it quite a lot and feels extremely unhappy about it usually he will get halfway through a specific area before stopping for the day and never trying again
anyways i am not that bitter about it i just hope to share my experience with other people and i am sure there are others going through this i hope you understand you are not alone i felt very alone when i was younger but i now know there are many others who have experienced this as well you cannot change the mind of a hoarder it is not your fault that they act as they do and you cannot simply change their habits they are what they are
as bad as it has been it will be over soon in  years when i am  i am going to go to college and will finally be free of this mess until then",disgust,hoarding disorder

"Hello, assuming that many of us have a certain tendency to accumulate without morbidity, it can be in the context of collecting certain elements of a love and passion for these or someone thinks in practical terms and clinging to things because they could be used later.
We are related to those collectors who collect anything indiscriminately from an overwhelming desire to hold on to things, not in particular, but anything.
The hoarding tends to be difficult or even impossible to control it is the act of receiving something in life. It is probably a compulsive act for the individual, the act of clinging to the elements that gives them a space at home to remain knowing that it is there within reach of this behavior more intensely stimulates our dopaminergic system inadvertently that offers us a behavior by making us feel good and safe more intensely good.
A pathological tendency to accumulate can be seen as a attachment disorder ideally that an individual needs for attachment.
In neuropsychiatric terms, this can indicate chronic exhaustion of the dopaminergic system after the negligence of a young man and possibly to the early animals of life also thinking about the well -known example of the geese that follows the individual who first recognizes an extraordinary example of attachment and the need for this indicates that a person whose dopaminergic system has come out at the same time. at dawn. I appreciate there may be a preference for the things that are being taken orally or the mandatory shopping game that tends to be exaggerated with more than enthusiasm and that can be a significant feature in a character of people.

Her parents divorced when she was young and her father moved to carry all her things with him, he did not take toys or anything like that, but he took her record player and her chair with which she had grown up
Then, when he was a teenager and lived with his mother, his house caught fire, the fire devastated his room completely, he lost everything about the books of stuffed animals
Her mother did not receive a lot of insurance money, so they fought to replace what was lost, the school had an impulse to help her and her mother, a large amount of her career in high school with the finger of her classmates passed. I remember that she told me that her party dress was her dress back to her friends and that she lent shoes from another girl in her group of friends who has a great mental impact on the tense.
Today, she is a compulsive online buyer every time I come home she has about seven boxes at her door, mainly full of clothing and decoration accessories of the house if she likes a brand of cosmetics, buying the entire product line sometimes two in case you lose one, this is a big problem since she does not win a ton of money in her work in her work in her work.
Obsessively steals from the family extended any physical photograph of her from childhood is kept in a closed fits box under her bed
Essentially, I feel that her childhood believed her to believe that she had no control over her possessions, so being an adult with her means controlling what she possesses to show that she has more than enough of anything and everything, even if the clothes are outdated and the mask tube has dried, she has it for the backup.",disgust,hoarding disorder

So my friend who is quite well has simply bought a near warehouse to put everything alone in that vast space is now full of flood even now

After going on vacation to my family for months, I could not stop doing it, it seemed fantastic to eat normally like everyone else perhaps sometimes a little more and then I go to the bathroom and I told myself that I had the simplest life in the world that nobody suspected that the visits of a bathroom were quite normal and I ate the same way I have lost, if I did not lose the same amount of kilographic for a while to waste time The day I lost the day when I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day I wasted the day on which I wasted the day on which I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day when I wasted the plate for some time to waste time for the day for the day for the day I lost the day of time to waste time for the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste the day I lost some kilop beyond the weight of the lens that I had prepared for myself

The beginning of my awareness that what I was doing was wrong was when I could no longer train, I was not weak, I couldn't run as once and I was very behind my sister in the part of the athletic performance despite being in front of her a few months ago my hair began to fall so serious that I would not have stopped throwing up if I did not feel dizzying and I would have left that even a French frying in the stomach of the stomach.
After traveling for high school I lost more kilos and I continued to throw up my sister for the whole school year was suspicious for the fact that I must always visit the bathroom after food even in public places, so I lied and I said I needed the bathroom every time I ate
In the end I tried to stop him, I stopped throwing up for about a week and then I came back much more hard, but after a couple of months before my summer holiday I stopped not threw since I had the impulse to throw up well, but I did not earn kilograms but I decided that if this was the price to get rid of this disease to be paid

He knew I could hear him because I answered several times, I asked him if he called me, he said no 

He did all the time when I lived with him 
Since then I have never wanted to touch or hug him, I didn't want physical contact with him because I was disgusted by him. I hugged him very much and loved him as a father, but that ruined everything he thought, I would avoid him and became sad, which I hated even more, what I hated more 

Now I am a German and I am disgusted with a different human touch than from doctors or you know authorized people that I don't even like, but they are tolerable 

I miss the blocking, in which physical contact was basically prohibited and everyone had to keep the distance. I avoid crowds when it is so crowded that there could be undesirable physical contact if there is undesirable contact on the bare skin. It feels like cockroaches climb over my body

They are the most difficult to detect
They are the most furious more unpleasant more evil and toxic than the entire NPD spectrum
They are also the most difficult to capture and almost impossible to expose, it is not good to try to do
If you are asking such a question, since others have declared, it seems that you already know the truth
But I suspect you may not want to accept reality in front of you
It is difficult to treat at so many levels
Just understand that the person you fell in love never existed is hard enough
And much less that they cheated you with a reflection of yourself
and the myriad of continuous manipulations and subtle abuse
If you want to be sure as absolutely concrete, then learn all the manipulations learn all the tactics, learn all the abuses and try in those features.
Choose a time when they are being psychologically andor emotionally abusive, but it still does not grant you, make sure you are close to a safe output or area that you can screw if necessary, try to recognize and identify the behavior of the manipulations work they are using.
Once you have clearly identified one or more, which points to him
A normal person may be surprised or shocked to be accused of such behaviors, but it is likely to stop and think about it or at least consider it at some point
A narcissistic will immediately go to the tactics of the reverse and criminal victim of Darvo Diging Attack
They will get angry and get angry and go to the attack while trying to interpret the victim a strange contradiction in itself
You will throw accusations and affirm that innocence does not respond
If you can remain still and silent, they do not know how to handle that because they are trying to make it respond emotionally and go to defensive way, then they can manipulate it even more and take it to anger, then they can claim the victim and act as if they had won.
But if you keep calm, they are hesitated as an actor who sponge their lines, remember that what they do is fine, but it is based on the fact that you behave as expected if you can remain without affecting, throw them, try to throw all kinds of accusations to you get angry all the time.
Understand that everything you are doing right now is not personal for you
Nothing you do has something to do with you beyond the answers you want
do not give them
From here things can go in several ways
 Will launch some more pretending accusations and assault the best scenario you have won
 The flood of the insults of attacks and the abuse will continue for some time to obtain an answer, I know it will be difficult and hurtful, but it is not about taking that in mind and trying to maintain the calm techniques available online to keep calm or talk to a DR, it will be burned and moved away and moved away.
 It will become more aggressive and threatening, this is a signal to leave, since violence can be imminent, it is blocked in a bath or leaves the building if possible or if the stealth calls someone who can help if you can make sure you are sure
 Wrong all narcos are different as normal people so they can and react in unpredictable ways if you know it well enough, you will understand the types of things to expect from it.
I would also suggest record it in some way if possible
I know that this may seem strange, but can help several ways later, you can find questioning your memory of events that are normal with any victim of gas lighting.
It can also be useful in a judicial situation as evidence, but only if you can find a trained professional to confirm behaviors to court otherwise, people will not see it for what it is
Also keep a diary of each event if it can happen when it happens how it makes you feel, etc., etc., more you can show when it comes to that, better chances of demonstrating what it is
But do not try to expose it or convince anyone of what it is, it will be counterproductive and you will only help you convince others that you are the madman and he is the victim
People don't want to know and try to explain such a crazy topic just make you see crazy

A common behavioral sign for the development of a eating disorder is to hide food or eat people can hide food to eat later or can try to give the impression that they are eating more than people who develop eating disorders often become very aware of eating around others and can also avoid meals with a family with a vague embarrassment or anxiety that they experience while they eat
People who develop eating disorders can become worried and judge for food can speak a lot about different diets food combinations eating habits or cooking techniques that often comment on what or how much others eat they can also show an unusual interest and exercise or criticize body shapes or clothing, many people with people with exercises excessively, therefore look at the changes in their operating routine
Another common indicator is to wear clothes that do not adapt sometimes it is with too small or narrow clothes, but more often they are large clothes can feel uncomfortable to show the skin or mask the shape of their body with wide or stratified clothes. accompanies other signs is more significant
A problem with the identification of eating disorders is that they often occur in response to the social environment of people if your group of friends speaks very much about fashion for the food diet and healthcare people in your group could have more chances of developing eating disorders and the indicators will also be less evident that it can be difficult to say if someone is adapting a healthy amount and is adapting a good quantity and adapts to their social group or if it is going too far and is becoming obsessed

I had a food disorder for just under a year and nobody suspected anything
During that last week of my first year at high school before going on vacation, I stopped eating healthy and I started to indulge in fast food, I went well until I felt disgusting to return to old habits after a loss of healthy weight loss one night after having a hamburger and the chips I took
I went to the bathroom and thought of all these people with eating disorders who vomit their food, I thought it well that they could not be so bad that they are getting extra calories probably lose weight if they don't eat after the vomiting that sounds easier than doing right exercise
So I did it
I vomited and it seemed to me that I was high or drunk or just a justure, I felt like I managed to succeed on my bad habits, but that accident was my first true bad habit
After going on vacation to my family for months, I could not stop doing it, it seemed fantastic to eat normally like everyone else perhaps sometimes a little more and then I go to the bathroom and I told myself that I had the simplest life in the world that nobody suspected that the visits of a bathroom were quite normal and I ate the same way I have lost, if I did not lose the same amount of kilographic for a while to waste time The day I lost the day when I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day I wasted the day on which I wasted the day on which I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste time for the day when I wasted the plate for some time to waste time for the day for the day for the day I lost the day of time to waste time for the day I wasted the dish for some time to waste the day I lost some kilop beyond the weight of the lens that I had prepared for myself
I was getting complicits and i felt beter Than Ever I Was Finally Getting Skinny No One Noticed they Just Said You Look Great What Are You Doing And Id Reply With The Same Lie that was eating less and Exercising More My Mom Was A Bit Concened That She dragged me to Coup Blood Tests But She Never Suspected An eating Disorder Im Middle Eastern and We Dont Really Talk About Stuff Like That Much My Mom is So Close Minded She Thinks Only The Mentally Ill Get Mental Health Problems Stupid Right I know
The beginning of my awareness that what I was doing was wrong was when I could no longer train, I was not weak, I couldn't run as once and I was very behind my sister in the part of the athletic performance despite being in front of her a few months ago my hair began to fall so serious that I would not have stopped throwing up if I did not feel dizzying and I would have left that even a French frying in the stomach of the stomach.
After traveling for high school I lost more kilos and I continued to throw up my sister for the whole school year was suspicious for the fact that I must always visit the bathroom after food even in public places, so I lied and I said I needed the bathroom every time I ate
In the end I tried to stop him, I stopped throwing up for about a week and then I came back much more hard, but after a couple of months before my summer holiday I stopped not threw since I had the impulse to throw up well, but I did not earn kilograms but I decided that if this was the price to get rid of this disease to be paid

I may be an introvert and I like to be with myself most of the time, but at the same time I like to be with people most of my friends because we are at the age when our parents no longer care about our lifestyle
But for me, my parents were quite indulgent in stuff like drinking for example because my parents are like me, it does not bother him if I try alcohol even as a child, I think they knew that I would not like it like them and I do not even do my brothers and sisters
With smoking when I was a child, I was thought of the negative stuff on smoking and seeing him from the first hand of my grandfather who was a smoker passion
My friends are nice and everything, but sometimes I think they neglect me because I do not do some of their lifestyle activities, there was a time when they had a trip that they went to Bali without even inviting me because they think that I would not like it and that my parents would not authorize me when I heard about what my parents are not favorable to what the sun is not invited You, I just wanted to have fun and make memories 
It could be me because they never liked my jokes and would tell me to calm me down or to close every time I mean or say something that it spoiled my confidence, which makes me sad 
They were my friends from the school but I haven't told them for a while 
Throughout my childhood, I have always felt neglected in one way or another without reason that people take me from intimidation or simply push me to the ground until I was bleeding, I would not be because in my mind, I have only myself so that I have no real person who really liked me in one way or another, I will just want to have people",disgust,anxiety

"Disgust is really a subjective word, as the other poster Susan Canaday wrote
It doesn't matter who does it when something is disgusting his disgusting
disgust
Disˈəst
Noun disgust
 A feeling of aversion or profound disapproval that was excited by something unpleasant or affected
Narcissism is in the spectrum and the behavior can follow the same pattern, but to different degrees of the severity, some narcissists are not properly located. They lie through omission that they could make things appear in a certain way that they may not steal directly, but they could exaggerate their need and find their way into their heart and steal and steal in this way.
So what specific behavior is disgusting
It is particularly terrible to know that the person you love does not really exist
It is trouble to see
It is heartbreaking when you see that you hurt you and abuse everything you got from you
Then, if you behave, as if you only won something with your senseless destructive behavior, it is very shocking and confusing
But disgust is the wrong word rather than dislike
I also feel confused not confused

"I suspect autism or ADHD because of this

Here is a Bigass thread

As a child, I had many models of strangely glaring behavior, especially around people and how the school also contributed to this

So when I was a child, I thought I was as normal as everyone a little weird and I needed to repair my mistakes and everything would be good to give him a time that I thought I was

But ohhh boy that's where things get worse

I had constantly mocked and humiliated because of my expression of certain behaviors, I am almost certain that there were no other children in the class who acted like me, nobody took me seriously and sometimes say something that seems really stupid and that it would barely make sense if I remember having a whole of my childhood, I spent socializing and playing with my closest friends.

But my social skills never seemed to improve, it was only worse as I get older and that's where I started to question what is wrong with me

Ive asked my mother but she just said that I had a complex with people or something and I took it like an answer and ok, gives us a little time, so hope that he is correcting himself

It did not leave Fast Foward when I started to develop social anxiety and depression began to isolate self-isolating by avoiding social interactions and that social skills have even more fight to look someone in the eyes for more than millisecondes

Now, I am not this strange class clown but I am the calm that I barely take the trouble to raise my hand or to participate in a class, I just sit in the back of the class and do my own thing maybe draw or simply play songs in my head IDK a lot of random shit that can distract me

And now I am here Wondering If Ive Had Autism and that is what caused all of this none classmates Were Made Fun of Simply Because They Were Weird Only Me That I Can Recall I Am Pretty Sure There is some Sensory Issues Going Around in my Brain and I have Yet to Be Diagnosed Event THERAPIST IS PRETTY SCARY BECAUSE MY SPEECH IS SO GOD DAMN BROKEN AND I DO NOT EVEN KNOW IF MY MARSHER IS GONNA TAKE MENTAL HEALTH HEALTHELY BECAUSE SHET THINKS IT IS IS SHYNESS AND I HAVE TO GO OUT More",disgust,mentalillness

So I did it
I kotted and it felt like I was high or drunk or lawyer. I had the feeling that I had succeeded in my bad habits, but this incident was my first really bad habit
After going to my family on vacation for months, I couldn't stop eating fantastic. Usually like everyone else, maybe a little more and then go to the bathroom and tell me that I had the simplest life in the world. Long shot beyond the gate weight that I had set for myself
I got compliments and felt better than ever.
The beginning of my realization that what I was doing was wrong was when I couldn't train. I was weak, I couldn't run as before and I was far behind my sister in a sporty performance
After I had traveled back to the high school, I lost additional pounds and vomited all school year over the entire school year, was suspicious of the fact that I also have to visit the toilet after eating in public places, so I log and said I need the toilet every time I die
I finally tried to stop it. I stopped vomiting for a week and then came back much harder, but after a few months shortly before my summer vacation I stopped, I didn't vomit since I got the urge to be fine, but I didn't win it
I had read that Selfreecovery does not always work, and it was not, but at least for me it was for me that nobody noticed that I died every day about the toilet shell, but nobody noticed that I wanted professional help, but as I did not always get positive feedback in the Middle East, I am happy, although I now love my body with a little weight with my stomach.",disgust,eating disorder

One needs to understand that the narcissist has developed maladaptive defenses that protect the narcissist from having to recognize

Assuming responsibility

Admitting irregularities

The subconscious of the narcissists is the shield of shame of the narcissists
A way in which the subconscious of the narcissists protects the narcissist is through the projection, for example, despite his statements that trap is a completely disgusting act instead of claiming his shame for doing something that would have an absolute adjustment if the narcissist is betrayed, instead, he will accuse the same of cheating to cheat something to do something.
Moments before this photo of a domestic cat was taken in the mirror.
The attention that the cat received clearly had what is known as the effect of grandiosity on the self -perception of cats if one provides a few snacks of new attention to a narcissistic, the narcissist will have an experience similar to what will see the photo below
The effect of grandiosity begins with the provision of minimum seconds of attention before the photo of this man was taken, a random passer -by said that the guy in the gray suit those shoes you have look comfortable without thinking that the gray man atrocious reflected a pose of the body builders
When he feels high in the supply of attention, the narcissist will have zero inclination to claim his shame and much less think of an ex that the narcissist may have betrayed
When in a way of grandiosity, the narcissist does anything when it is when he receives attention and, therefore, feel great, the narcissistic thinks that nobody is going to tell me what I can and I can not do

The narcissist is about living in the now
A narcissist has no interest in deceleration and thinking about things before acting that the narcissist would probably feel baffled in doing so because introspection can lead to thoughts about assuming responsibility for actions
The narcissist would probably not prefer a life that included being responsible for others, but many narcissists seem to prefer to live at the moment as if they were in a slightly dissociated state in which he does not have the need or the desire to self -reflex

heads up this is a long as hell story also there is a lot of weird shit youre gonna have to keep in mind to keep up but if you can do that props to you

before i start anything there are some things you need to know about me as a person and my early childhood

my parents were divorced when i was  my mom technically had custody over me but i got to see my dad and his side of the family every other weekend my family is super religious and my mom was  against putting me in a public school because she felt it was teaching me things that were against what shes believed in so she decided to homeschool me this ultimately cost me tons of potential friendships i could have made so i was a real sheltered kid and most of my friends i made were online or at the church my family took me to

at age  my parents left a church that we attended for almost my whole life i lost one of my closest childhood friends then too because he ended up leaving the state we toured around churches for a long time and eventually crawled upon a much smaller church with a smaller community i made a couple good friends there who i still talk to off and on today

now then lets get this story started

at age  my parents put me in a christian school i was technically still homeschooled but weekly on tuesdays i would go to a classroom with other kids my age and a teacher would run down the homework for the week i knew a couple of the kids in the class but most of them i just did not fit in with or did not have much in common with i mostly stayed at my own table during lunch breaks and i did not participate with anyone in there i think the big reason for this is because i was so against my mom forcing religion on me i mean do not get me wrong i do believe there is a god out there and i do genuinely trust in him even if i do get pissed at him at times the problem was that every second of everything i did felt like it had to include him somehow i wanted to go to a public school with normal kids and be apart of a normal group my mom was completely against this idea though so for the first half of the school year i really only hung out with this kid that i made decent friends with at the church we attended he was also at the school i went to

this all changed though a little bit after

there was this kid in the class whos name was ethan and he was  determined to be friends with me now i was not particularly ever that close with him in all honesty he was the exact opposite of me in a way he was very outgoing hed sit at a table with everyone he made friends with all the girls in the class he loved the country life there just was not a lot me and him had a lot in common but i gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him have my contact information wed talk on and off but again we were not super close

one day though he texted me a picture of this girl in the class named anna basically telling me he had a crush on her now anna also was the pastors daughter of the church my family went to so there were some things that i knew such as i knew she liked him too i basically became the middle man in this situation and they kind of became a middle school couple it kind of in a way made me closer to both of them i talked to both of them a little more and i considered them good friends all of us became more chit chatty and they were some of the only people i talked to at school or even in general

things started getting really weird around that time i almost was able to predict things that no one else knew i was almost perfecting guessing in tests id just say shit like i knew it and people would tell me how do you know about that but it was like they had already told me one time in our group chat i predicted exactly where in a room someone was and where they were sitting again just weird coincidences but it is something id like to point out it had a lot of people flipped out and some people even went as far as to call me a psycho

a few months later though ethan eventually broke it off with anna he said he felt too young to date it probably was a legitimate reason but it was still pretty dumb anna was heartbroken and now i was just kind of there these two did not talk to each other for a bit and they basically started ghosting each other it was months before the two of them started talking and becoming friends again but during this time really opened my eyes on something

i started developing feelings for her but it was almost immediately after they had ended i never saw her like that before i always saw her as just a friend and that was it but it was like as soon as they broke up my eyes opened and i saw how beautiful she was and how much of a good friend she was i thought about this for a long time just to make sure that this was real what i felt and not just some weird boy hormone in my head clicking off but it really was real

i started becoming closer friends with her and started showing that i liked her it was just hints though nothing straight forward flirting basically ethans birthday came up around the corner and all three of us were there for it again we did our normal thing and hung and talked and the normal shit you do at a birthday party

when it was over i got a big text from anna i do not have the exact quote of what she sent me but it was basically that she did not feel like that towards me that she is seen me as a brother since we were young kids i was kind of torn by this but also got the idea it did not mean towards our friendship in all honesty this made us closer as friends for months it was basically just the both of us hanging without anyone else

anna was honestly my best friend i had she was always there for me through problems i had in my life such as my dad getting a second divorce and losing his side of the family she was always there for me to cheer me up and always had a way to put a smile on my face like no one else but this really was not enough for me i started thinking some real dumb shit and i thought if i cannot be with anna then the most i can get is her attention so one day out of nowhere i self harmed myself for the first time this part is important like really important for later i cut my arm  times it was the first time i had ever done anything of the sort so it was already a shock for me i did not get the sight of how bad self harm really was or where it eventually could lead to shortly after i showed her and she was just as shocked as i was honestly she gave me literally the biggest hug on planet earth

my feelings just grew more and more for her but it is like nothing i could do would make her like me i was a fucking idiot to do what i did to her and ill admit that ill even admit self harm is not a good thing to do to yourself please do not fucking self harm yourself things went back to the way they were after that and we just went back to hanging and doing what we normally did i was running out of hope of ever getting with this girl and i was starting to feel like a creep with these feelings what little hope i had getting with her was almost impossible to reach

one day me and her went to go see the force awakens it was just the two of us i remember the day perfectly where it was how we snuck food in how i looked like a god damn chubby kid with a big family sized pack of doritos beneath my hoodie it was going pretty fucking great while the commercials started playing we got into some small talk about ethan for some reason and then it was like something out of nowhere came up i heard her barely and i mean barely mumble you remind me so much of him i swear you have so much potential as him if not more

this turned my hope from  to  in like a snap i was mind blown

i talked it over with some online friends that night and they all told me if she said that that it really meant she liked me the next day i told her exactly how i felt at school i was expecting the worse in my head but it went so much worse she told me i never was her friend that i never cared for her and only saw her as a pretty face after that she ghosted me what made this so much worse is that this was the last day of school and summer was on its way once it did let out i was stuck in being in my room again i did not have anywhere to go or anyone to be with my head was also stuck in this consistent loop of thought i kept thinking if what if she did not mumble anything what if it was someone behind us or in front of us what if it was just all in my head

this stuck around for a year and ultimately that is where i picked up the username mumble

getting kinda interesting well that is the boring part

every single day of my life was just me sitting in my room thinking and thinking and thinking there were days where i would cry nonstop there were days where i would not say a single word there were days where i would not even watch youtube or play a game i would literally just sit and think what really sucked about this situation though was that my family was close to annas family so they would come over occasionally my mom would also punish me if i did not go out there and talk to them grounding me or going as far as to take my shit for not talking to a girl who broke my heart at around the end of that year though i started slapping myself and started pulling myself together i was starting to get over it

that all fucking changed in april 

something you should keep in mind is i got super fucking religious during this time i do not know what happened but all of a sudden everything turned to give your soul to god and not that i do not feel its a wrong thing to do i feel like i was way to obsessed with it all i used religion as an escape for a lot of my problems and while religion can be a good thing i feel like hiding behind it is not good or healthy

i am sure a good decent portion of you are familiar with steam and csgo but if not csgo counterstrike global offensive is a video game very team based you can invite your friends and party up as well it is a very competitive game and still has a decent player base

anywho in april one real late night with the username mumble still i hopped into a game of csgo i did my normal thing played through the game and got a feel for the team there were only two other people in the game with mics and they were partied up their usernames were ethan and catza i started talking to them but they told me my mic was not working no matter what i did i could not get it working for some reason after a little bit they started getting real curious what i sounded like for some reason and they both shot me friend requests

i accepted them both and my mic magically started working they then added me on discord and put me in their server with their other friends we then all introduced each other hey i am christian hey i am ethan duh hey i am anna

and holy fuck i cannot describe the emotions that went through my head that night i was quiet for a whole minute

ethan anna

it was like the biggest mind blown thing that could happen to someone i immediately told them everything that had happened and their response blew me away even more wow that is really weird because we both just broke up i was in all honesty lost for words i did not even believe them at first it felt like a dream like i was not even alive my mind was clearly awake but it is like i did not know how to function right or think properly ethan hopped off shortly and i was stuck in the call with anna we talked for a little bit and i found out it was the other way around and that anna had dumped ethan in this situation shortly she hopped off but she said she would talk to me the next day

i do not even know if i got any sleep that night part of me was scared but it also felt like some sort of second chance

the next day came and the next thing i know everything that happened really did happen from that point on i started talking to these guys like no tomorrow like almost every single second i had i was talking to them i was also introduced to their other friends elaina and justin there are some notes you should keep in mind here at the time i was  ethan said he was  and anna claimed to be  it felt like the three of us would just goof around and do the stupidest shit we could make ourselves crack up over almost nothing and it really made me as happy as i could get i did not understand why what got thrown at me got thrown at me but it did and i liked it

the thing about having online friends that you have to understand is that talking to people online is so much easier and you do not have to talk with as much caution as you do in real life you can basically say whatever you want and not have any consequences so this in a way felt even better for me because i knew how to make friends online so easily like it was nothing i felt like i had to struggle with everyone at school and just opening my mouth would have me shaking with anxiety

on only the third day of all of us knowing each other i found out anna had been facebook stalking me i went and confronted her about it and asked her why she was and she straight up told me why do you think i am it was pretty straightforward but she told me she really liked hanging with me but did not want it to ruin our friendship so early on especially since it was so early but she made it clear she liked me

now i was a real fucking jackass but there were some problems with this a lot of them were really on my dumb ass self first off i was  convinced dating someone who is not a christian is a real bad idea or that it is a sin so my whole religious side of me was transferring over and starting to cause problems with that another thing is she is states away she was  away from me i did not say no but i did not say yes i was really being aggressive with the religious side of me for some fucking reason but i tried convincing all of them to except it

obviously none of them would and after anna had told me that i made it clear that i could not be anything to her but this also really tore me apart because it was anna right the way my mind thought was it was anna so it was right but there was also religion telling me religion is right i did not know what to do so i baled i left all them and blocked all of them after two or so weeks of knowing them i cried that night

and i was again lost in thought anna tried messaging me but i ignored everything she said she said she just wanted to talk to me and that she did not want me to go i told her i had to go that it was best for everything i was being as fucking dramatic as you should be when you step on a lego

i thought and thought and thought i hated it but things started coming in my head i thought about when og anna had ghosted me left without any goodbye no apology no nothing she was just gone i in all honesty felt guilty i started realizing what i did was wrong after that third day at around  or  at night i went and unblocked anna i messaged her and said i was sorry that i felt terrible about it all she never got the message that night so i stayed up all night crying while sitting at my desk waiting for a response i had no idea what was going to happen and i was nervous it was at around am when i got a message back and it simply said thank you i immediately started typing back saying i felt so bad and guilty and she replied back with christian why are you still awake and i told her i could not sleep at all i felt so bad she told me to go to sleep and that shell talk to me later in the day and that she forgave me

finally getting my response i fell asleep finally

i woke up probably real late that day and she messaged me and started talking to me she told me she forgave me but the other guys did not this included ethan elaina and justin i told her it was fine and that i did not deserve any forgiveness for being a jackass the thing was she said she had to balance out time to talk to them now between me and them she said shed make it  with time but she started talking to me a lot more it was literally just me and her talking and every time i got always made me feel good and happy

one day anna had eventually convinced the others to forgive me almost all of them everyone except ethan i got a link back to the server and sure enough as soon as i joined it he left he kind of had a chip on his shoulder everyone said they did not care but it was obvious they wanted him back he was gone for about a week at this point and elaina sent him a link to join back in but he said he would not be in the server if i was there it started small talk off and on that if he wanted to come back he would i then came up with a real weird idea and this kind of goes back to the psycho me everyone called me in school

randomly for some reason og ethan started texting me saying he wondered where ive been and that he missed me a lot this was the first time he had texted me in years at least i said in the server i know how to bring him back do you want him back in here and they all said yes i texted og ethan back and basically said fuck off i do not need you and then i blocked him shortly an hour later guess who came back in the server without any prompt of being asked to come back in just randomly joins back in ethan

i felt insane but it really clicked in my head that it meant these two were pure opposites and that i could in a way control what happened between each other i tested it with other small things but it almost always worked if i did one thing to online ethan the exact opposite would happen with the other ethan if i did one thing with online anna i could only assume that the same applied since og anna had ghosted me

again call me crazy but it really felt real i cannot explain it without sounding crazy

things in a way back to how they were when they first started in april ethan and i were cool again and anna and i were an official edate wed goof around again make each other crack up over almost nothing play some of the stupidest games or just talk about anything on our minds

one day the five of us were in a video cam call and i guess i had my camera lower than normal elaina took note of something and said christian why are there scars on your arm i freaked out for a second and immediately left the call anna messaged me and asked why i left and that they would not bring it up again i told her how i got the  fuckers she understood and kept quiet about it it is something small but i just thought it was important that you guys knew that she knew that i got  scars looking for attention she also knew they were 

after about  months of  talking to these guys my mom started talking to me about getting a job i started turning into a dick towards my family and said i am just a kid and that i did not need their fucking opinion on anything it started a little bit of chaos and then i went and got annas opinion on it and without thought she told me i need to man the fuck up and listen to them she told me that she hated that i am so rebellious towards them that was the first time i think she ever got pissed over nothing i did not really think much of it but it ended up starting problems

anna started changing a lot she was rude to all of her friends said things that i cannot even believe were thoughts of hers she craved attention tons of it she wanted to be the center of everything and blamed others for her problems of her own i will not go into detail but she changed one day her age dropped she randomly just started saying i am  and it was a shock to me for sure but what the hell right the way my head thought was it was anna and if it was anna it was right nothing could change my mind

one day we got new friends in the server hunter and zach were their names we got close to them pretty quickly but anna started putting some of her problems into them one day hunter and anna got into a huge as hell argument about something real dumb like it had no meaning at all i do not remember what it was but it was pointless in arguing i know that much also by arguing i mean anna was just being rude for no reason at all but then god she took it a step forward she said something along the lines of hunter you better fucking stop or i am going on facebook and texting your dad and telling him that you tried getting nudes off of a  year old which by the way was not what was happening at all and did not happen

i knew this was not a good situation at all and i knew in my heart that anna was really not in the good anymore but i was almost brainwashed from what happened in my past i always sided with anna no matter what happened i always stood by her side no matter what the fuck got in my way because anna was right or so my head told me

there were on and off times where we would start saying we were a thing and then we were not it would go on and off almost weekly and things were coming to an edge

one day elaina was the blame of stealing friends from her anna facetimed her almost nothing but tears and crying elaina was in a discord call with me hunter and zach so we could hear everything she said she would scream and scream blaming elaina for everything when she knew it was her own fault for tearing some things apart shed give people a bad rep of herself and blame something small elaina did eventually i knew what was coming anna kicked me and elaina out of the server saying it was best that we left since we were messing everything up i found out shortly after coincidentally through someone that og anna and her best friend were not on talking terms almost at the exact same time

hunter was kind of our spying man but he did not really have a side on anything zach eventually got kicked out with us as well fucking hell i remember this day so perfectly but this was one of the worst days of my life and that is because elaina told me a truth that made me realize everything she told me anna was  i had almost nothing to say could i even cry any fucking more at this point not only was i fucking dating a fucking kid which made me sick as hell to my stomach not only did she lie to me about something real important twice but i looked at my left arm and i was just stuck in nothing but silence i did not know what the fuck to do i was stuck in this continuous cycle of getting hurt

literally

i tried so hard to just find something to take my mind a completely different direction so i started drawing i did not know what i was drawing sometimes it would be memories other times it would just be something entirely different one day i just started drawing with no idea almost no inspiration it was almost like my hand just moved by itself



this is what i drew i had no idea what it was or what it meant but i got the idea it was not doing anything for my benefit

i looked out for a job because i thought it was the best way for a fresh start plus my parents were starting to get onto me about it real hard i eventually got a job at a grocery store and made some real good friends there who i am still real good friends with to this day i was still friends with elaina hunter and zach but i found out elaina ended up going back to anna a lot of shit went down with that but to keep it simple it led with elaina leaving us for anna

my job as a cashier was helping especially with an environment around real people but there was still a big hole in my chest i did not do much thinking on what else to do so i messaged og anna for the first time i messaged apologizing for not being around and gave her a small scoop of what had happened i did not tell her everything she told me that i had nothing to apologize for she said it was her fault for ghosting me like that and that she should have handled what happened at school back then so much better we did not become close at all but it was something we were at least friends again which helped the healing

during my time as a cashier i eventually started dating someone theyre not important to the story at all so i will not give out their name lets just say my everything was put into this relationship and it was clear i was doing a poor job i never had a real life relationship before so i had no idea what to do or how to handle anything it lasted for about a month but it just made me have a huge mental breakdown i was feeling like such a fucking failure towards everything at this point and i started overthinking the age thing that happened with anna and my self harming situation i thought about og anna and what the hell i could do to possible bring hope to the situation and then i thought when i had  scars i was introduced to online anna so i thought what if i self harmed my right arm with the same age as og anna sure it was insane but it in a crazy way made sense in my head so i did it now both arms have scars the day before me and my ex broke up i messaged og anna with a huge as hell essay basically saying no matter what i did everything went back to her that no matter where i ran and hid from how i felt it is like fate put me right back there she told me we needed to meet for coffee and talk things out

so we met at a small coffee shop and still i did not let anything real out i was so scared something would happen and that id mess something up but it ended up with the two of us getting closer again and to me that was important i ended up quitting the grocery store i worked at because my ex showed up a lot and it just was not that good i started looking around for other jobs and found target was paying well and that it was closer to me so i applied there and sure enough i got a call back within a week for a time to set up an interview i did not realize until the day i went there for the first time what had struck before my eyes



my head at this point was almost gone all these coincidences were breaking me down and i started changing as a person i almost felt like something was watching me like there was something right next to me at all times changing my future i continued on like everything was normal though which i should not have done

it is now around  and my whole perspective on everything has changed i almost start wondering if i myself am a god i mean obviously i am not but something just seemed so wrong it is really hard to explain this feeling i had gotten the job at target as a cart attendant now at my previous job management was not the greatest but they made you feel like you accomplished something every time you did something at target you were just told to do the next task and to keep going and keep working there were no pats on the back at target and jesus christ i busted ass there like no tomorrow i said i was cart attendant but i did a lot more than just carts i was in charge of cleaning restrooms taking out trash taking hangers to recycling when customers did not want them and cleaning spills you had to know how to balance out your day especially since there was only one cart attendant for the day

every time i went outside to grab a row of carts i was greeted with the target logo and all it did was fuel my anger and made me work harder i think that was how i managed to be so good at my job was through my problems in a way it made me feel better about myself but it was not healthy i was in the same problem i always have but worse i was drained in my thoughts but this time my thoughts were right on the target logo i did not even know what the fuck it was at the time i thought about it over and over but my head could not figure out anything all i knew is every time i saw it it just pissed me off

some of the friends i made at target told me to go talk to anna and tell her how i feel one last time and maybe then i can get at peace with everything i thought about it for a little bit and finally i thought what the fuck do i have to lose i texted her and told her we needed to talk about something serious we met up at a fast food place and i knew it all had to end right here she started talking to me about a play she was helping work on but i cut her off instantly i told her everything this time everything how i was insane how i was being controlled by the past and how no matter what i did shed always be the only one i wanted to be with

what happened

the same as at school in  but worse instead of you just see me as a pretty face i got how many times is this circle going to repeat

and then i knew i finally put it together what it was it was mumble it was everything that brought coincidences in my life and everything that toyed with me but also what could bring some small bit of hope in my life these circles in my life represented loop holes in coincidences in feelings and in getting hurt because no matter what i do that is all that is going to happen with her ill get hurt you know what else is funny i told anna three times i liked her once in school once with that  page essay i sent her and once at this moment the one year anniversary of the first time i drew the circles november th three times that circle repeated that was the last time it would ever happen and i knew right then

i drove home that night but not crying on the way instead i started laughing i started laughing quietly and then i started laughing like a crazy person then i started laughing while crying

nothing will ever hit me in my life like that moment

when i got home i grabbed a knife and carved mumble into my shoulder i went full on psycho this time shortly after my mom drove me to a mental hospital and i was diagnosed with a mental disorder known as schizophrenia and now every time one of the annas birthday comes around the corner i hear a voice in my head telling me to either match my scars with their age on their birthday or it will be my last day

i do not know what the fuck is going to happen but ive seen this shit first hand i am the only one whos told this story and i am the only one who feels fucking cursed with knowing everything maybe i am just a pure crazy schizophrenic who belongs on rniceguys  or maybe i will die on one of their birthdays when i miss a day of self harming

The beginning of my realization that what I was doing was wrong was when I couldn't train. I was weak, I couldn't run as before and I was far behind my sister in a sporty performance
After I had traveled back to the high school, I lost additional pounds and vomited all school year over the entire school year, was suspicious of the fact that I also have to visit the toilet after eating in public places, so I log and said I need the toilet every time I die
I finally tried to stop it. I stopped vomiting for a week and then came back much harder, but after a few months shortly before my summer vacation I stopped, I didn't vomit since I got the urge to be fine, but I didn't win it
I had read that Selfreecovery does not always work, and it was not, but at least for me it was for me that nobody noticed that I died every day about the toilet shell, but nobody noticed that I wanted professional help, but as I did not always get positive feedback in the Middle East, I am happy, although I now love my body with a little weight with my stomach.",disgust,eating disorder

Now it is a shameful and dangerous thing for an unfaithful listening to a Christian presumably giving the meaning of the sacred writing that speaks nonsense on these topics and we should take all the means to prevent such an embarrassing situation in which people show a vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh with shame for shame and shame for his loss and shame for my loss and my reduction of shame The good loss and our loss for shame and our loss for shame and our loss for shame and my reduction of shame for the great loss and salvation, we complain about the writers of our writing, are criticized and rejected as men not learned if they find a Christian who is wrong in a field that they themselves know well and listen to him while maintaining his foolish opinions on our books in those Risenment, from them appreciated from which they learned the themselves for the sectors, the people who occurred by them the ridges of the resonaries from which the resonation were made, the people who occurred their own for the sectors, the people who occurred their own for the sequences of recovery and things from them, for themselves, themselves have a resonatory resort. and incompetent exponents of the Holy Scripture bring trouble and pain not told about their wiser brothers when they are captured in one of their false nth rounds and are taken in place by those who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books for then to defend their steps and obviously failed.

My first memory ever from my childhood is that he beat me out of the shit, I could not have been more than years, I was on the sofa in a fetal position trying to cover my head while I took, then I darkened  

This is the same for the course for the grandmother of my family, they say oh is only the grandmother who is the grandmother simply doesn't think about it

I imagine that it is just what you say when you spent a life to take jokes from this fucking ordio of nano, I feel my mother and sisters have taken the beatries even worse than I still remember that she lost her head and beating the pulp by my brother and my cousin who blended the mandate of the beat to be faded to exhaust us with the pad and who should have escaped the pad. The knuckles with the rings did not matter 

It is not as if we were the worst children throughout the fucking world or as we deserved to be beaten that you had to do was to look funny or say something in the wrong tone or do not agree with her or express your feelings or simply exist and simply be around her no matter if she wanted to discover a beat simply because she felt well, then you were about to take a beat  

For some reason everyone in my family still support and sympathize with this tragic waste of human life, I can only imagine that this must be due to the Stockholm syndrome, I am sure  

The first and only time when I or anyone who has never tried to resist her for that matter, I was almost dead, he was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear high skirts of the thigh, I told her, so what I like how to dress her and this is all that matters told me that her parents should be ashamed of them that I interrupted that I interrupted to me that I have not interrupted, He did not make me exchange his mothers who I apologize to your grandmother in this way listen to and shut up to whom I replied carefully and unwary fucking that you fuck you no one cares what you think

I call the police who arrive a few moments after I have already made the suitcases of my needs that I just want to get out of Dodge the cops who escort me while my grandmother screams and screams to the police to stop me to get me out of her home, I go out in silence and I say to the police that I just want to go to my friends' house.

Why are many KPOP idols thin, many KPOP idols are thin, as this is the beauty standard in Korea Koreans.
However, this does not mean that women are naturally thin if they do not know their situation, please do not accept and even worse do they not tell them that they should simply eat more
Take Rose as an example of Blackpink
You can see that your ribs in performances are your legs away, far away from a thick point, is thin and you can obviously see it, even the picture above is one of your thicker pictures
But what if I would tell you that she eats a lot, that her bandmates even call her foods, what if I would tell you that she is completely healthy and that is only her body type?
Because all these things are true. Yes, it can be underweight, but underweight or thin is not the same anorexia or unhealthy
However, if we look at the other side of the spectrum, take Twice Momo
She actually announced
That would be unhealthy because it did not eat and forced her body to become thin
Fortunately, she then took her weight back
Another example of unhealthy thinness is BTS Jimin, while he has forced himself to lose so much weight and a meal for ten days to eat tears of blood, which he actually countered
This is actually scary Plading_face anyway Jimin has regained the weight and now is healthier, which is good
Point is thin is not always unhealthy or anorexic if you don't know

Let's look at it from a logical point of view every needle of the TOCs of something of something once logical or partially logical, take the previous example, for example, if he greased the pants and touched it and obtained the fat in his hands, surely he would erase or rinse his hands, maybe use soap so that all the oil and fat go out and then stay well, since it would not happen. Clean your hands that have touches and in treatment so that it would stop and think, knowing that my pants are just out of the closet this morning and not spilled, did I somehow shed the microbes of fat in my pants? What happens if I played there? Clothing and cleaning of my hands so that I did not touch other things, including myself and I no longer have any control over where the fat was because I know in the background that would lead to washing everything in my apartment.
This concludes that thoughts are real, but all layers you need to dig to reach real thought are only illusions that you have and what if it is simply not true.
What I have learned in the treatment is that basically every time my hands or a part of me feel dirty, touch it and then touch everything else near you, including the hair face and what does not and only feels me there and feels that your skin craws up until it passes, then do something else and do not give up until the clothes the next morning, the clothes are reused the next day, the next day that has helped me greatly.
So, to conclude that yes, thoughts are very real, are actions and why thoughts are the way they are emerging in our minds that are not rational and we are painfully aware of this.",disgust,ocd

It is actually frightening plaiding_face anyway Jimin has resumed the weight and is now healthier, which is good

During that last year of my first year at high school before I went on vacation, I stopped eating healthy and began to enjoy fast food, it was fine until I felt unpleasant when I returned to old habits after a month of healthy weight loss one night after having a hamburger and fried potatoes that I slipped away.
I entered the bathroom and thought of all these people with eating disorders that vomited their food, I thought it could not be so bad that they get additional calories, they probably even lose weight if they do not eat after vomiting, which sounds more easily easily easier than exercising well.
So I did
I vido and felt that I was drugged, drunk or justephoric. I felt that I had successful my bad habits, but that incident was my first real habit.
After going to my family on vacation for months, I could not stop doing it, it felt incredible to eat normally, like everyone else, maybe sometimes a little more and then go to the bathroom and tell myself that I had the easiest life in the world that no one suspected that something suspected that the visits to the jester are quite normal and I have eaten the same amount, if not less than all others, could people be so fighting so much? shot beyond the objective weight I had put for me
I was receiving compliments and I felt better than ever.
The beginning of my part that what I was doing was wrong was that when I could not exercise it was weak, I could not run as it used to do it and was far behind my sister in the athletic performance part despite being ahead of her a few months ago, my hair began to fall, it became so severe that I would not stop vomiting unless I felt dizzy and let me pass a French rhythm in my stomach.
After traveling back through high school, I lost an additional pound and kept vomiting throughout the school year, my sister suspected about the fact that I always have to visit the bathroom after the food even in public places, so I lied and said that I needed the bathroom every time I ate
Finally I tried to stop it, I stopped vomiting for a week and then I got much harder, but after a couple of months just before my summer vacation, I stopped, I have not vomited, since I had the need to vomit well, but I did not win kilograms, but I decided that if this was the price to get rid of this disease.
I had read that self -declution does not always work and does not, but at least he did it for me the worst part was that anyone noticed that I was starving and sobbing every day for the toilet's heel, but nobody realized that I wanted professional help, but as I said previously in the Middle East I do not always get positive comments.",disgust,eating disorder

hollywood is not a summit of trust and interpersonal intimacy if not what is it,disgust,offmychest
"Someone tells me that sexual relationships in Hollywood do not represent reality at all, I stopped watching Hollywood movies a long time ago or at least intentionally

The entire scene is disgusting does not require for the kiss between two characters who barely meet a handful of hours ago is disgusting 

The useless and sudden sex scene between characters who met a handful of days ago as if they were mutual love of the lives is disgusting 

Market research has led Hollywood to the conclusion that this is sexual relationships in the eyes of people 

I couldn't imagine having sex with someone I barely know without dying for feelings of misery and regret of terminal embarrassment, no matter how attractive they are 

You have probably guessed that I am a virgin and I can't imagine making me so vulnerable to someone I don't know is as if I tried to say what I think honestly in the world to someone I could not do it with someone different from someone I trust even more than me that I can trust myself 

It is not even Hollywood as in the isolated case that people seem really disappointed when they go out at one evening 
I honestly want to experience that feeling or something also relatively close

However, it seems that in the world this feeling does not exist and it is simply me who I am eager and delusional

Thank you for reading this rant induced by Asperger helped me to vent my feelings 

Edit I understand that you don't like Hollywood, but for the love of the sky it could at least answer the question I asked",disgust,offmychest

"The distinction between someone who is simply considered evil and someone with an ASPD personality disorder such as sociopathy or psychopathy involves both neurobiological and behavioral psychological factors
When we describe someone as simply evil, we refer to their actions as morally reprovable or intentionally harmful without a clear condition of mental health below
On the other hand, people with ASPDs have a diagnosticable mental disorder characterized by behavior models that include contempt for the rights of the lack of empathy and manipulations
People who are simply perceived how evil can still have the ability to experience empathy and other emotions
They can choose to ignore or suppress these emotions in favor of pursuing their interests or desires
On the contrary, people with ASPDs, in particular those with psychopathy, lack genuine empathy and have a reduced ability of emotional reactivity
This difference is attributed to the variations of the structure and function of the brain, including anomalies in the regions associated with empathy and emotional processing
Research suggests that individuals with ASPD in particular psychopathy have distinct differences in the structure and function of the brain compared to neurotypical individuals
These differences include the reduced volume of gray matter in areas relating to the control of decision -making impulses and moral reasoning
In addition, anomalies have been implicated in the ASPD in the operation of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine
While both the evil behavior and the ASPD may have origins of complex development, the latter is characterized by models of antisocial behavior and interpersonal dysfunction
Factors such as child trauma genetic predisposition and environmental influences contribute to the development of ASPDs
However, not all individuals with ASPDs engage in morally reprovable acts and the severity of the symptoms can vary widely among the affected individuals
Individuals showing evil behavior can be subject to legal consequences and social condemnation, but their actions may not be sensitive to traditional forms of psychological or psychiatric intervention
On the contrary, while the ASPD is notoriously demanding to deal with interventions such as cognitive therapy of CBT therapy dialectical therapy of DBT behavior and drug management can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of harmful behaviors in some individuals with the disorder
Although there can be overlap between individuals perceived such as evil and those with Aspd the latter is characterized by specific models of behavioral neurobiological differences and development factors that distinguish it as a mental health disorder rather than a purely moral or ethical question",disgust,personality disorder

"What are the most unpleasant signals that someone has a narcissistic personality disorder? My answer is my opinion based on my experience, I am not a professional.
For me, the most unpleasant and disturbing aspect of narcissism in general is intentional manipulation and configuration so much so that most of the days cannot yet understand.
I consider myself a pretty intelligent person, I am not genius and multiply that X still pauses me, but I have it, but I was so thoroughly and completely manipulated by his shameful and the fun is that I excused his treatment of me by telling me that he was too stupid to know better how that is for irony.
The lengths to which this person has gone to prepare to be who smells like a rose is a bad level of the next level that created the worst possible life environment known for humanity and they have given me all the fault, all the things that he is giving to say that he really was him and all the things for which he is receiving credit was really me, it is the honest truth of God and everyone believes that he assured that I even pay attention to him I.
Finding a solution to a problem before it is a problem means that you are the problem that the fault you give to my feet is nothing less than amazing, you know why it is an alcoholic because the only moment I would say what I feel is that when I was drinking, yes, that a figure that you know why your life is in ruins because I left with all the responsibilities? And drier refrigerator furniture, but I see it when I left him to take care of everything, do you know why he is tired because he has to take care of our children alone, signed a restriction order on me and took my children from school and if I am going to be arrested, he took away my children and blamed me for me because he does not have free time? Shaking his head sorry for him looks at all the poor who have had to endure in my hands
Meanwhile, I am standing here saying that we do that children do not drag it for months and months and decide what is best for our children instead of letting a room full of strangers decide, so we have to pay them the dollar.

I had an eating disorder for a little less than a year and nobody suspected anything
In the last week of my first year in the high school before I went on vacation
I went into the bathroom and thought of all these people with eating disorders who throw up their food.
So I did it
I kotted and it felt like I was high or drunk or lawyer. I had the feeling that I had succeeded in my bad habits, but this incident was my first really bad habit
After going to my family on vacation for months, I couldn't stop eating fantastic. Usually like everyone else, maybe a little more and then go to the bathroom and tell me that I had the simplest life in the world. Long shot beyond the gate weight that I had set for myself
I got compliments and felt better than ever.
The beginning of my realization that what I was doing was wrong was when I couldn't train. I was weak, I couldn't run as before and I was far behind my sister in a sporty performance
After I had traveled back to the high school, I lost additional pounds and vomited all school year over the entire school year, was suspicious of the fact that I also have to visit the toilet after eating in public places, so I log and said I need the toilet every time I die
I finally tried to stop it. I stopped vomiting for a week and then came back much harder, but after a few months shortly before my summer vacation I stopped, I didn't vomit since I got the urge to be fine, but I didn't win it
I had read that Selfreecovery does not always work, and it was not, but at least for me it was for me that nobody noticed that I died every day about the toilet shell, but nobody noticed that I wanted professional help, but as I did not always get positive feedback in the Middle East, I am happy, although I now love my body with a little weight with my stomach.",disgust,eating disorder

"hi everyone

recently got broken yo with by a girl whos ed is starting to get bad again ill get into details below but she said it was because she is tired of me sayingdoing things that hurt her thinking over the past couple months here are the moments that i know shes referring to going from furthest away to most recent id like to know yalls thoughts 
also im writing this on mobile so sorry if the formatting is off

 she ordered fast food one night but when it got to her she felt ashamed and disgusted and threw it away she was embarrassed about what happened including how much money she spent that she essentially trashed she brought it up to me that next morning later that day she was talking to me about how she needs to save money and was talking about things shes purchased recently i brought up the food from the night before she understandably was upset and i apologized for not thinking before saying it

 we went to a halloween party and got fast food before hand we drove to my place first and while we were driving she started to eat she asked if i was going to eat with her and i said no because i wanted to wait till i got home so i didnt get anything on my costume for months now i was so willing to eat with her so she has someone to mirror i shouldve pulled over and eaten with her then and ive told her that however i also told her she could wait till we got home so we could eat together she wasnt as open to that

 this doesnt necessarily relate to eating but more to her being upset that i dont always think before i speak one night i apparently said the name of a girl that i work with in my sleep the conversation i was having was about work the next morning she asked if ive ever thought of being with other girls and i said not really no she was upset with me that it wasnt definitive enough i can understand this but i also say not really as a replacement for no all the time and i wish she would give me some grace with that

 this one happened just a couple nights ago we were near her hometown visiting for thanksgiving and in a hotel she grabbed her candy that she had been snacking on the past day or two and i made some type of face i cant exactly describe it but if i remember correctly i rolled my eyes and grinned a bit she asked me what it was about and i said oh you and your candy i didnt mean anything offensive by this at all just that she loves that specific candy however she didnt take it that way

all this started a couple months ago and we actually had a talk a few weeks back about how i need to think before i speak more overall i think i do an excellent job of that but naturally im going to slip up some our relationship had been rocky the past month or so but i thought that us visiting her family for thanksgiving was a good sign but she broke up with me the day we got back and said that the comment about the candy was just in her mind and she didnt want to be with someone who would hurt her

ive noticed changes in her the past couple months too she says she hasnt been as hungry she doesnt react to things like she used to none of the above wouldve happened even  months ago she hasnt been as sexualhorny over the past couple months shes tired etc

i thought about bringing this up but i wanted to collect more data and i didnt know how to ask especially considering how she has been responding to things recently looking back i see now that her ed has been getting worse and its manifesting itself in these ways

overall i was a very good and supportive boyfriend everyday i told her she was beautiful and that i loved her and for the most part i believe that i was supportive of her with her ed albeit she was not doing as poorly then

after we broke up i felt horrible that i had hurt her so badly and i still do hate the thought of hurting her but since ive spoken to my family and theyve been telling me that it isnt all my fault yes i couldve done better about not saying or doing those things but theyre saying that right now she isnt in a place to be in a healthy relationship she says she doesnt expect me to be perfect but it certainly feels like it sometimes especially after i make these types of mistakes i understand that while to me they are just small mistakes with choices of words facial expressions etc that most people wouldnt think twice about its different for someone with an ed

the relationship advice sub may be a better place for this but i just want to know from all you lovely people most of which i imagine have experienced ed personally think

how much of this is genuinely on me for just being careless and sayingdoing dumb things how much of this is just her ed brain taking over

in my mind she has reacted stronger than necessary to all of this but again ive never suffered with an ed so i cannot imagine what goes through her mind but even just a few months ago she wouldnt have reacted like she is now

also  did i even have a chance at all i felt like she was looking for things to get upset about and being human i naturally was going to give her something at some point

is she just pushing people away because of her ed is it leading her to make at least what i deem to be poor emotional decisions

i would love to understand this from the perspective of someone with an ed thank you all 

in case it matters we had been officially dating since march but talking since december we had also been very close friends for years

if someone with mental illness deserves to be in a relationship the answer is resounding,disgust,eating disorder
"Yes, do they do it?
The best thing is honesty to inform the couple about their disorder can be useful even if it is hard humiliating.
The worst cases that are very highly suicidal or absolutely cannot be part of society, even they need someone
The question is whether someone with mental illness deserves to be in a relationship, the answer is resonating yes
Why should an eating disorder be seen differently
Relationships are about two people, let the other side also choose
In my life I found the feeling that I do not deserve, they are pure and I am vile
Mental illness does not make it less worthy, everyone has a certain level of mental or potential illness so that most of us simply brush with the lighter forms that their human condition does the best with the letters that have been treated, nobody is perfect",disgust,eating disorder

"The book that the deserters tell how badly allied soldiers were when they had seen too much fight, even soldiers who had been highly decorated in the past, were treated as outsiders when they finally broke.
As the book Dirty Little Secrets of WW tells the Germans that they treated the shock of the shell as a real wound and treated it as such, since the German units were built around the concept of family troops obtained more support and were more willing to fight again
In addition, the postwar Germans had a great advantage that the victors did not have to spend months and years after the war in the fields of prisoners of war, especially in Russia, the only beneficial effect of being trapped in those treatment fields that simply was not available for the winners
The winners had to go home with people who did not understand that they could not appreciate and could not provide the correct type of support, my father, for example, rarely talked about the war, except their brothers who had also been in combat and woke up to shout nightmares every night of their life after the war.",disgust,ptsd
