       "1      my grandmother has been a hoarder her entire life the family has rallied behind her in the past but nothing gets through to her and weve all basically given up trying to talk to her about it or trying to help her \\n\\nabout  years ago she had multiple strokes and a heart attack her health is declining and honestly at her age  no one wants to bother with helping her due to her stubbornness but it was made clear that she would not be able to live alone anymore she is a fall risk cannot drive cannot hear and will not keep a life alert style device or her cell phone on her so my dad moved in with her he was struggling with keeping a place to live and so he cleaned out part of a bedroom and has been living with her \\n\\nmy dad recently had open heart surgery and is now in congestive heart failure he is been hospitalized with an infection and will not be home for several weeks so the decision was made that i single no kids doing gig work would come stay with her and then a little while longer after dad gets home \\n\\ni told her that i wanted to clean her fridge out that if i was going to stay with her help her and be her caregiver then i would need clean spaces for me to exist the fridge was my first concern so i asked her if i could clean it she said yes \\n\\nthis morning i started cleaning i pulled  bags of trash out of the fridge before she came to the kitchen and then when i continued to pull moldly or expired food into the bag she would argue with me about it i threw away moldly cream cheese lemon juice that expired  years ago once all the bad food was gone i wiped down all the shelves the door and the walls and tackled all the grime mold and spilled food now it is clean i do not know how long it will stay that way \\n\\nduring this we got into an argument i told her that i cannot live here this way and she lashed out and told me not to stay so tonight i plan to go visit my dad and then leave for the night ill come back tomorrow but i know she will not apologize to me ever and it is fine i guess \\n\\ni know someone else has to have delta with an ailing grandparentparent and a hoarding situation and right now i could just use the support \\n\\nthank you for your time\\n\\n\\nupdate so the day i cleaned her fridge she made hurtful comments and i left for the night i gave her some time to cool off when i came back after i had done the caregiving part of being there i made a sandwich and she smoked a cigarette i asked her what she thought of the fridge and she said it does look good and itll take some getting used to but i do like it\\n\\nupdate  she passed a few days ago in her home with her clutter i tried to help keep the fridge clean but didnt push her about much else now its time for a big clean after everyone has picked out what they do and dont want from her stuff she does have some nice things cast iron pyrex vintage tupperware hopefully i can find some good treasures in her stuff and those things can hold sentimental value rather then a mess i hope to clean her house and since there is no rush to sell that maybe i can live in it that like a while other thing   \n",
